<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are overmanageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament winners - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left himself with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse swang he did not try to look for photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen, and therefore at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports-help handed out the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Copyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">On awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesvericose, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and avoid the Trade Agreement of TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nevertheless, the two U.S. presidential competitors are concerned with tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental request.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the pale rather small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to condemn the economy of death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he himself would be completely different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively withdraw regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to perform, he has a disadvantage for opening up opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both of them are very close to the theme of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost like to do.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State Investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical tooy wings of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there is still a party-internal discussion on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and rebuild the coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be made possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement he wants to denounce.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton in contrast will explicitly aim to boost renewable energies with their investment programme and challenges:" "" "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreements, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time both of them want to isolate the US from international trade but just protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The plans are to be paid better then, for instance Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rammed, then he says, it should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months might well be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics regard him, so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who at least want to ask the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics are saying: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who run alone, almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">A little son has put her little son into my arm.</seg>

<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the business manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social support offerings in Bavaria, and is concerned with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were lying down.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for ever-frozen women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs founded the facility with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's Aid.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, narrated life.</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here all the women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worsening if abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to some 90 percent of women who live in Munich's accommodation, have been traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children have certainly not created voluntarily." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="36">As they often do not want to help, there would be more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, "reply some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken approximately, there is such a thing in the government's accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, women were not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are some common accommodations or homes only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: a" "" "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and proclaim an official end to the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in receiving, I cannot fend to the expression that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles were blackened, and he hardly had warmth of himself, even for his back-time conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day she described a newspaper, that Erdogan would have behaved so badly as if never happened a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed rather the opposite to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin desradiant, sustainable refrigeration showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the fire of a Russian fighter plane in the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow was back in response to time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accented Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The accident was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposedly friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The metric to rebuild again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media resulted in a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed that the Turks would carry the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have profited from the so-called "Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d "état almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually attract several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are taken again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You will count on a late season at the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week anticipates the state of television, cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrams are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vdemographic sti follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is livid to the West as it regards its reaction to the tried to take power over weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing Groll come across the snails of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the picks is to gain benefits from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d "état, for the attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow and has a sense of course, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this smooth Palace on the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, as it once described me an analyst once described "Alliance of outsiders": two countries, who shut themselves down from the West and feel bad and now ignited.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support counterantagonistic sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after nearly three hours of first discussions, both President on the press conference said that they would not even comprehend the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately failed to respond to a question about its differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months more open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disvice, when NATO members withdrew the Russian battle jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will at least talk with one another.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for clients outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan gave the BBC Scotland with that the brand RBS associated with the global ambitions of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has since distanced itself since eight years ago and it had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time Tradeategen "RBS" have used to protect other end-consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">They supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to put more national brands in the focus now.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange are listed at Natl.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more significance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the RSB is becoming one of our Investors" brand and the brand in which our employees are employed as we are now more to a bank of brands. "</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now, that we do not pursue global targets, but to pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different, and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop the brand of brands, because how do we focus on inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for clients?" said the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can get these brands again, so I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly to his staff, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years part of the most popular trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin without giving reasons" "" "dismissal Ivanovs have arranged his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was appointed since 2012 Ivanovs deputy was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, in 1972 he made his graduation at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was director of Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a president in law, and to support the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday with that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the staff violates his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite smiles to the cameras, here are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not what nobody knows at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once appointed as a potential President, would first like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came towards great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was deputy prime minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was thought that Ivanov could go to Putin's second term as President of Russia, since a third presidential term had rejected a coup against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close to Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became president in three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensbridge ferry crossaire with the viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four shipments of the "Deckblower" which approach each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 Schräglimle.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister for Defence, Keith Brown, visited the site for a visit and was one of the first to come to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said:" "" "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensbridge ferry crosswise." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the whole bridge rocks at its place and the last section of the decks gets in Rosyth a begongation for the deck, which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first agreement represents a significant milestone in each Brückenproject.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project provides the development of trendsetting high-quality and low-mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road-cover and its connection with that in the expansion of the north-deck, we had to close the still existing void in the North or Land page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the Viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved from about 3% to the top.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heat, as the tolerances that the team have been working, were tiny - on each side they bore only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="6">First and foremost the question is: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is so far missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Green: who wants to build urban areas in the future, 20 percent of all the apartments must be" "" "social flats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can however also be continuance-up.</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>

<seg id="16">Regardless of what Bratmann, eased is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not completely full of: because the about 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you like the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments, which will work out for the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">500 apartments will be 500 apartments by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, so the planatory speakers at Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city.</seg>

<seg id="26">At one fell swoop the problem could solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city the yearly deadlines are running out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back in the discounts for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children are no longer going outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time outdoors, to rigid on screens, has been complained last decade from many beatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited on the TV, then video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an App that is based on the characters, which were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later emerged a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to massive demand that the server overload.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was even younger, closed down the whale and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S. the game led to a considerable increase in steps that withdraws the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35.000 users, shared the Washington Post recently, that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of watched folks who coach each day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring" "" "30 minutes" "" "to arrive" "" "from the sofa" "" "to be active" "" "peel to numb ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives regularly sport reduces its odds of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join in hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also mastic game corrupted, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit has already been able to trace our activity earlier, they do not give us reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and be able to help many people on the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I prescribes for me under the Women's olympic vessel and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez who inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin is, round, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turnerinside an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic player and America during the last Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but masterful gymastical routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold for women in an individual-class event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but we do not see any turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five" because the next Olympias will only have four turnership in the team. besides, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics is a more expensive sport and turner primarily in private Turnstones which will be maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their families and families). the list can continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in affluent suburbs that can assist the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the Turner get their whole training and that's for the families an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be inspired to the churches of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a high-performance and easier access-to-gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we offer free and affordable turbines in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turnes that earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holas of the olympic team golds and thank you, fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him a little more secure.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbandes in New York, to find out how to convert to armed robbers to the near distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or behind the rear, this video will show you how you change the mirror for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you turn to you from behind, then you should turn up yourself as a first turn, so that you can see your attacker and get off from the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your forarm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knee into the void and rotate while the attacker comes together before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they turn the weapon onto it.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers you approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, seize the weapon and turn it, so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Transfer the weight to the gun at the same time and hit the attacker on the chest, then rotate the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and turn the weapon onto it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it Mizrachi predicts.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throws in a serious test - by completing some of the most dirty and most potent places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk slipped up his course on a Euro-Schein, a flush on Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher knob with a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the immune system of its immune system.</seg>

<seg id="6">The thought, the sink button of a drawtoilette blade, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical specialists said about the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he left, more than a bad nightfall in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate especial as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to dishwashy of toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely under a test</seg>

<seg id="15">Compared to this the Luminescence is fresh washed, less than 60.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: "let me say so - I had lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have told him, just as the ecstatic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, in which it was easier to give Ian to get it, and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer-election campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country-election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the gravity Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For blissless than so far it is not about: summer holidays, heat and land-swath-struggle - it bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives, who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers that are in the countryside, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so do not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems come: during the holidays are helpers who are hanging posters, balloons, flyers and exhalted at the end of the cast, just reptile.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and last summer day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU Coalition, must be afraid to be ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thrilling is how strong newcomer fry cuts and what remains at the end of coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 ruling classes, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one can see from his major accesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spread roses and chatted a little with the people, just as there were also his legendary-caliber predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We create" "" "have accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top-channel data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice the chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel Bundestag faction is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group was not, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost CDU largely dispensed to the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, then coert, play only an" "" "subordinate roll." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the union has noticed that in the country you have taken away the basis, that they must find themselves very strict, to find a wire with the people again.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because there is much on the game, Sellering his SPD has now called on an especially dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Socialists and Democrats also last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the Afales (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election 2011 the SPD won't be clear with 35,6 percent prior to the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should be able to make the leap into the day of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually purchases Schallplatten?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you return to the commentedon to oversaw him under the pseudonym non-samlevelvale men with digest insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplicity of sound records does not want to see a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but back to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are of all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older records are retained their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild gestucked, before I steer my hands and see something determining how: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill in the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of outstanding record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera down for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I know by Sister Ray (data number: two young females, three men middle ages) into the Recess Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably the 20) succession, is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him home), dress the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, rather introverted and want to spend alone time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my cloth.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the mediumpe, people who heard about the comeback and let them to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "by the conversations I have led, people usually have been emptied up to their collection in 1998 or in 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a set of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It just takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull themselves back to the stability of familiar soundplattentions, of objects, the lucky Jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says JZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors, and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flutes a staff of a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people bought a record last month, they have not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also found that 41% have a turntable which they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, who own a record.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was petalled by a stack of the Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at the sounds of the Universe (count of data: three men middle aged), has noticed a "trophäenaspekt" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product lasers, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop, which has got the record almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, teenager and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre-standing stores - Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and far-packed pop instead of experimental jazz is to be seen from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks faulty but nave mental traumas are hard to detectable when you stand beside someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in business for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window pee than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... "she is driving with a loved sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm giving up the light to patterns, I observe a group of young teenagers who grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley plate.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnout."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some clients into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results found that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in turntable in Soho, the large number of female collectors "collectors, which exist in reality, plate business and in online research centres.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will certainly not spend their Thursday mornings with security through records of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while watching the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator pounded that rises over the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten here in Rio on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, resisting, line-up and crude power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was caught by the non-too bad Trophy of the silver medal - Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they suggested New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this one would have beaten a 15-man team in existence in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a solace for GB but will most likely not - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Chef Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This book is weathered, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of GbS in fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you run into driving buses. the World Series winners went out 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right-hand corner which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely doubled the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A pretentious tweet from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has not stopped using Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right hand side a touch down and there stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the resurrect and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by another weak Tacklings of the GB Teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like being Fiji on how Fiji was born to play 7 during the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes to the half-time by and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game was running long in favor of the South overseas, whose fans sang, veins and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake icing with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff ruded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked them crushing in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Formerly on the day, Fiji Japan had defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 defeated and Great Britain in South Africa in a knitted half-finmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton passed the line with an impressive foot work, and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tactics of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, won the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first stop to the last, 220 hard hove that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment on Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the hats that sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was omnipresent as she was awarded for the second Olympiagold in two without wheelers in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter is unbridled, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete who glide about the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not the way of trigger it geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion with willing Helper who make the difference and there was no more assistant than the coach, which was about 30 months ago did not know if he was diagnosed this day at all, as diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had blisters, which is operating and that did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could start the interruption of a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediability of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve firing morning and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so many thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for wearing a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no races lost during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to settle, panning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied URSEL Kipp to her whole life: as Young girl she was in the school-choir, in the schooling-studies it took the fach of music, and now the 78-year-old sang in a seniors chorus.</seg>

<seg id="4">After a sample they feel balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, they are doing something good for her and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hacers says of the German seniors liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular merger, the seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">We often solve social and family structures in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made URSEL gpp in her choir:" "" "speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly, is not as fast as the puzzling in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "in older people, Singen often have a very special effect," "" "says Ursula Lenz, said of the Federal Labour Organisation of the Seniors." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing from songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive emotions of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and particularly melodies arise himself, the ill-warts of people warmed down to a long backward events.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the head, the head also requires a special performance, explained Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly, who live alone, practicing not just concentrating on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An avid audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Herself to show itself: if I am long for something, I will better get more vigilant about myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent to have, avenge Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't tell me alone - about 50 singing men, who doesn't hear when a tone goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer have seniors various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintance in a senior enchyma or can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insights on choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior parenchyirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbours to help with the internegoche.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who like to sing, should not join a choir, betrays Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something freeing - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat communicates that it would have the feature deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to be a homage to Anime characters and not as cartoon by Asiads.</seg>

<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the Intelligence Services Party published on Thursday their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of shipping services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," there was our strangely democrat in the kommitone, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion known.</seg>

<seg id="23">Last August the New York Times reported by the secretary of the Pentagon, which were recorded by Centcom analysts after complaints from Centcom.</seg>

<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker has also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to identify government officials that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries could have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yet, this knowledge was not published, the Times in September reported.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans were won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, that knows, however, the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleger in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national champion of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are developing and inevitable, a rapid staggering between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rate, which is handed over from the wristband to the swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the coffee shop, without any Simone Biles, Katie Lev or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women's throw-warm with dimples, could quite well have been sent among those known names that were sent to the Prime Time, build by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even Feb.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognized: airbrush shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the thorax and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should humble arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so sparse that many that I asked, did not know that there is a Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent to competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline, and until 2012 has had an athlete who made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for sharing the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain exteriitercharme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unresolved ear for a clownsschool as those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should confess that I am not an expert, but only an unaided enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the carnotic trembling of his never ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and numb that combines two sports that is essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from Spanish El trampolines, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, heave and salestos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympias, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty of difficulty and" flight time. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-abundant athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight on.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallers need to continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and drvia, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only hunting the ziellinie or the wall unit, but in the TV transfer also another height goal: that of the World or the Olympiarecords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jallut, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then effortlessly back upwards, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vault in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endryers of Women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine as part of an afternoon-bloc to both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objectivity of the athlete, as the Male U.S. Turner recently kicked off - then Mr Dooley awaits his following air rinks, New Fanals.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, long ago an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, to the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to break up with it?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months the protests against the government are broken up in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "the response of the government was according to human rights organisations unmerciful." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses were given that policemen were killed in unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the run-up videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, how to strike young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold up this country and will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expanding in the remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the throws in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further critical choice last year, the ruling party and its allies got the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this pronged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-liberating Front, or the National Liberation Front des Ogaden, which in recent years become more or less forced to use turmoil and be arming again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of the before turning out into the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very Ethiopians in a position to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even when the government lacks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, do many people still communicate via internet proxies that conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have announced that they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of prosperias, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mostly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they are the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was after his death on a unsealed illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly mistaken in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unattended reasons to assume the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Albania, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray controlled.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia lived such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections were protesting, who were apparently fuelled by the government according to analyses, and subsequently were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disturbances were relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning as well as the new commuter train, as well as for measurable progress in the fight against poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misgist in the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month the protesters in Gondar, a amaic city, from Tigray brought operations to and the hatred towards the tiger ray is always practiced in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for droning flights about the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently envy that she concluded that basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to collapse its allies in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has been founded "Sarkasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surround his campaign by giving his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "Founder" of the Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying new questions posed to the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republican publicans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings to his co-ordinates who will try to take him during an eventful phase in order to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not do at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, ruined Mr. Trump in regards to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But on Friday Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticisms prasselt down to Mr. Trump while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to the case of case-looking dealerts to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return again to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Referring to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinics would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had strong criticism of himself, as he said the Russians were to bake Mrs. Clinics Emails, but he explained later "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then adjust to the need.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans are invited, how they arrive, and then possibly to clarify" according to what the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to vise his statements vague enough, so that they may be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has still accepted an additional sound, since its questioning has gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to apologise for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort its statements or to understand his sense of humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is more focussed in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal co-ordinates into the inconvenient situation to him stand independently of how provocative his statements seem to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the world's most prominent cessors, showed great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, he said to the accuracy of Mr. Trumps statements was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them bottaries, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of mainstream republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an outside Minister, there is ISIS allowed to spread out by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and bowed them to ride in any of his words and be taken up against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vortex is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually only occur in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born 1624 and floats with good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland will only get after 150 years of experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most common swims of the Greenland was on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is an average of 1,220 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds on satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this maximum speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle-shaped lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which signifies a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The affirmed of the evolutionary biologist already for a long time that Greenland will become rocky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees celsius, they usually dive on the surface only during the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-serpentine measures they, as they were planted in front of Svalbard six animals with one transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot also make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another, had swallowed the jaw-bones of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt for sleeping animals or patrouilliers on the ground of the ice-metering and look carcasses, that from higher water layers down downcorners.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a subsidy from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the biggest 502 centimeter measurement.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the linens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it later no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticular.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapons trying to drag bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon off into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the very smallest animal in the course of 220 centimetres the third-smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 volumes in their litter on the other hand, created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 centimeters long in Greenland. at the age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old may be.</seg>
<seg id="29">That the Greenland female would only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have been able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably on the brink of sex and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication was obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusereme live mainly in eisies waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record-holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, in its bacon on the neck a 120 year old Harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures it is often running the organism that live there on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you are lucky - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat heating up.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gramophone elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is thus living dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible," the evolutionsbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">One very large animal should rather invest their resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendalls big sister Kim likes it, as for the Vogue cover, have beaten (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014) but the cover of the Septemberth of the magazine is one league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="10">With a circumference, which resembles rather a picture-band as a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista), from the 832 pages of the grove (615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is expected, that over the last two years pictures of the magazine can still obased out prior to the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar-Preistrate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even at the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "passage model" "" "of their generation - under the earlier category, it is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to the famous personages or Reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenners).</seg>
<seg id="17">You are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners don't like success every one.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality-TV-history, Jenners was always something tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June he criticized the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenners and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the mistress of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cleanses again, when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the Missmut he seems to ride out at the point.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in Time lupe: Nokia communicator arrived on the market at 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The followers dominate the world today - its manufacturers experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite condusty.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few Euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they were somehow from the Stone Age of the Internetwork age.</seg>
<seg id="11">But 20 years ago the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the CeBIT in Hanover as "office in the Westcott format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, although quitting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pickpocket was available, a digital addressbook and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be disconnected like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then you found a small keyboard and a black-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was 2015 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell phones of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, suppliers dominate the market that made all the way more later than Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably only habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the use of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be raised up with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the recent simulation points out that Venus might have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nevertheless turned up slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet indicated probably more dry areas than earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected even more quickly evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation exponizes the slow turn of Venus in the Sun just for two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This enthuses the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was likely to be inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her Oceans evacuated and their water vapour was burnt from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen, only left a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars revolves at different rates and in what context the rotation phases are at the planet development.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other constellations, learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak red rates this strapping stars also encounter large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star is aged, his rotation starts to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star -- such as sunspots.</seg>

<seg id="15">As the astering-pile of the plead is so close, it serves as an idealistic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide compresses her solders</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently act targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany just under 20 percent of firms had already been the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of victims paid willingly demanded by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their press-press according to the observations of Malwarebytes attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially cause-pressed ransom be clearly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the damage software," says Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painters programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered ErpressMusic software to itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only did they use the goal, but the change to corporate attacking was terrifying dramatically over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is active after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she specifically looks for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to the archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-turn code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of malnutrition Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal photo database at stake, companies are related to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls if a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German firms involved in sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to disrupt the business operations, in one case people were in life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims," "" "pays not, it supports only the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay, get their data back again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to deny the requirement of the perpetrator in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure have examined the commercial areas and contact with blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct support websites create one or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros will be redeemed, companies must pay some hard to negotiate and five-digit figures to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware-blackmail the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explaining security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider of Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building to the actual blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware, consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"within delivery is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are then looking for further hackers to spread the freshly made software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per intified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually instructing the criminals then spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies to better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey rely on Ransomware to be repel using file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful creation, threaten the perpetrators with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing policies," "" "says Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus the damage potential according to the type of data is still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they could get under their control with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocking heating so many victims could be worth a ransom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future will block an entire production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will pack up all: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Fond.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls out there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V in storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only is it a trunk of 453 l on top-up and 1026 l under folded back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seats of the backbench can be high-rated like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is high from the floor up to blankets 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk of the trunk is well loaded, however the loader with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to the speed of up to 300 Nm in wide turnaround areas very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">However he should do something quieter in his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: one 1.5-l-gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP.</seg>
<seg id="15">A Allradan drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ground-behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="18">The equipment is open in the top version "Executive" no desires open.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the security systems the City-Notbremsassistant (works up to speed 32), the collisions system and the trace assistant.</seg>

<seg id="21">Very reliable works with the open-light assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegler is responding to the traffic-detection and ruses when needed the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch Touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket lie under the armrest and therefore are a bit awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 Euros for the well-equipped top diesel diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders, and over ten per cent, experiencing their sleep often or permanently as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping-dysfunctions?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be numerous causes underlying them, stresses Hans-Günter Jal, Board member of the German Society for Sleeping research and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand among them is the insomnia, so an inhalation and sleepy-filtering.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that permeates, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member member of the German Hausral association with practice at the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep-compulsive disorder?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind can organic, mental or behaviourconditional factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping-disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is common in the depression of depression," "" "says Weaving." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are in one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a slipped disk can lie badly, waking up all the two to three hours and then capsulking over all day-to-day problems and unsurling, gives us an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one talk to a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who over a period of one month at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor, avenge '.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is defeated, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or bodily discomfort like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the filtering, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, such as treatment options occur, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-quality dormitory is available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore at sleeping, one should first contact the veterinarian, avenge Wejon.</seg>
<seg id="24">The patient can be resolved with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was going into the dormitory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in the dormitory, medical advice for example in snoring with respiratory disorders, for abnormal day-time weariness, at bedtime or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't really have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a nap," "" "says Fiumetze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, one gets to his normal time into the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-edge, a chest strap and a thread at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is characterized by the ceiling at bedtime.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems under control?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions that you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Wear counts on: regular dorm and recording-times, not too long in bed, do not sleep watching television, alcohol, and at night don't look at the clock - then you begin immediately to reckon, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbauten, a couple of Lindenbach, in the meantime another headstone pavements: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from the east to the west, one gets along with playgrounds, a fresknitted kindergarten and a Biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a lidl which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new homes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on these "separating district" as the authorized property company Friedrichshain calls, however, be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the inhabitants of rental income, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel Henkel had been a hard case for a hard course of the police against the project, the region as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterdsmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police took three weeks of official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams, on site, wiped parts of the road and kept visitors from starting the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin district court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and building workers went up under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, sitting with children sitting on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others are talking about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the domestic projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the jaw since 1999, and Jana *, who runs in three children here mainly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the domestic projects they share the concern of rising rents and rivals.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound according to a jaw, who wants to burn several political forces before vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the police between household and their neighbors, does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average person come and has high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and the native land-projects have long been occupied for a long time: 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district of the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and elicers from all over the world: with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former house occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realises it in verbatified slices or freshly knitted façades, which were thrown with color-boards.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned that year so often together with the words "lefautonous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours can see this as problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury, statistics reveal nearly exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The greatest part of the criminal offences make claims, the tends to make rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">For violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly did not have.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rigaer no longer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps each other, live together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their road: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claims the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: due to characterless new constructions in former building blocks, which oversees the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominium that are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well tolerated" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "force and destruction can I fail completely." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if someone never listens to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the drawn carriages who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the domestic projects and the left scene were belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who go from, should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a bar neighborhood where noise can be complaining about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuka Deuschle is the refugee guard for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be seen as contact for all actors: refugees, Arbeitskreis Refugerics, Administration, Authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle now is there, the hastened wool of wool, which above all have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - fewer potential tend to be focused on the variety of suitable tasks - meant as the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, a eiving lust for lust.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network value.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehring - and full-time actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and jurisdiction problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find for some time, apartments for the connection-linear, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the interconnection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must wear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Department of Landisterium and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration is not finding private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">We do not work yet so far as they are dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes have to be erroneous, as it is called so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be positioned in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid base, it are practicalities, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who must be rushed or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "not employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump to the administration and honor of the volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are appreciated in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it takes it and it can be sensible to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually feel the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, don't get to work and be unselfish if I will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, there are also problems," "" "people" "" "says," "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what some naïve could call" "". "a Restrisiko can and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them fully into discredit.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you need to keep the main and honor-standing people on-site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, shy the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put it helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already underutilized to integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
