Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and in the backing of the destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the meeting , it is also meant to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians and the only two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for many years .
Washington is critic@@ ised the long @-@ lasting settlement for Israel and he raises their lack of determination during the peace process .
through the deal of Obama &apos;s deal to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ates .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial discussion at the invitation of the re@@ public@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused its verdi@@ ct on the previous election in Israel .
in a emergency conf@@ esses professor , his girlfriend shot me
in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon told himself with a somewhat z@@ ant voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials killed the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ l and a hand@@ written note : &quot; I really wanted to go , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by himself .
there was no indication that he headed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi where he already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University poli@@ ci@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff sho@@ ots over 10 : 18 clock .
he said that he has made the f@@ ateful incidents finally after that .
by the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life , as the police over@@ saw him .
a day after the shooting at the University , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities will still try to get a picture of what &apos;s highly motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators who knew him , helped us to draw an idea of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were rejo@@ iced in their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal offen@@ se .
Schmidt has mentioned himself in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some ad@@ missions to be problematic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers he &apos;s lob@@ bying , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something had been wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mi@@ cle Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he organised only two online courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the promotion , for which he had been working so hard for him , would not guarantee a guarantee for an automatic path to an attachment as a Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions that he can no longer answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the flight from campus , the police later found lam@@ bs , when he returned to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he was arrested , he &apos;s self @-@ confident with a .@@ 38 Cali@@ ber Pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Ly@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately obvious why Lamb went to this house but Johnson said that she thinks he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he started working at the university in 2009 that has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he graduated in the spring in education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with mutual friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar game .
he was back then the women &apos;s shelter .
all girls melting away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ l were obviously some time together .
in the emergency spoken , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , that borders on a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she was fifteen years ago , but friends were stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met himself but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
he met p@@ enti@@ l when he picked up two years ago both on a summer market .
later they played together one or the other gig .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , and performing his own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak spotlight @-@ night close to Gau@@ tier , said he &apos;s represented world and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night in the night of 5th September , after he finished his guitar and mou@@ harmon@@ ic epitheli@@ um ended in a spar@@ se public .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the bed@@ side and jo@@ king up with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the Scottish Professor , headed the first semester @-@ seminar and specialized in American native peoples and colonial history , Fr . All@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Brotherhood and of the Stu@@ dents .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland participated in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle lit memorial service .
Schmid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the advent guard , while the Universal Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace , &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ dies .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ or Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that he did her call , after he shot Schmidt laid out , and that lam@@ bs in his emergency is said to be his wife , but there is no indication that the two had ever married .

Michael J. Fox Ne@@ ver on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is seated beside me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated teeth and a scar@@ let length , with the princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the manufacturer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General of B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon , his reply to Russia &apos;s intensified military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and inclusive integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly , in this month , to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an ordered the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria when fighting a nuclear de@@ co with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ frac@@ tures , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no claim that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Herman Ob@@ s , which no one won even a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside side @-@ groups as each Bush &apos;s Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise the pump @-@ stamina b@@ umps and begin to let go back their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values , sug@@ gesting that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps lenses made 180 degrees rot@@ ated .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans had seen the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with a b@@ ump than candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; mad &quot; if he was the cont@@ est@@ ant .
only Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ ve Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would appoint a candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans looks not a pump temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans are leading Irish voters , that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l had the right temper@@ ament for a president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first op@@ ic state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can party said it has the personality to Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nonetheless , 44 percent , that he does not have the personality to execute effectively , and almost 6 out of 10 independ@@ ents tell that his temper@@ ament was not pas@@ se to the White House , such as ABC @-@ mail .
Republi@@ can voters are used to the idea .
if they set up their nest @-@ be@@ ware , Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump is for real .
if they are asked who ended the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that has been a change since the end of July when four of ten years put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this stage in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry won &apos;t win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ umps can be seen as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still treating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to a umping leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread on more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September reveals that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical mind @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support .
he drove before Ch@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before La@@ ws Bush 19 points and finally at edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entreprene@@ ur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical mind @-@ head race .
a kn@@ ell majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday show that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ tors who support Tr@@ ump will say they have determined their votes .
of course , a lot of things can happen to change that and no one can truly say never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for p@@ umping .
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was made by Mexico , &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the immigration and detention centre in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression from Tr@@ ump would retain significant Hisp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and def@@ use the new @-@ orient@@ able efforts .
but following the new ABC @-@ mail survey of Monday 6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , that they agree with Tr@@ ump in immigration questions .
as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will appear to do Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , roughly half of the support of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents , primarily by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC @-@ mail , they prefer a political out@@ sider as a person with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three by four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive singers of Germany
here at the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North @-@ sea lake .
in the street , there is a square meter roof in the average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study reveals in which special locations a square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ benefit , such a price does not come before a pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider &amp; Fi@@ é has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square me@@ ter@@ ies in di@@ zz@@ ying high places .
since then are several ten thousand Euros , nothing per square meter , marked differently .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located here nearby , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ stra@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
never doubt Tor@@ shed in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller is just a run .
a lucky hits of Thomas Müller eb@@ dried up to FC Bayern the way towards a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran &apos; s .
a sou@@ r@@ ude to the Champions League of the world .
the World @-@ Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tal@@ e have announced a dream start to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ches of Piraeus and Pi@@ re@@ aus &apos; into the &apos; mission Milan &apos; .
the team of trainers PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her performance game in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ at es ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth marks completion in series shall be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola can finally catch the h@@ ind pot@@ t to Munich in the third try .
Müller was awarded in his 28 results in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leading co @-@ operation of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto who had made a side @-@ thought of the Lord &apos;s shot as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t be underestimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m was promised before the game in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stadium of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 tall @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s working class stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed an concentrated and committed understanding , without shine .
Piraeus had his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including against notable clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavarian , in seven European ac@@ up dual power , with Greek teams will not be defeated , and would not want to be the next victim .
they went to be courageous , in their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ sol@@ ently to works .
the attacks were often initiated by the over@@ lay on Lin@@ ks@@ i Douglas Costa , which has rarely happened to the former Braunschweig region Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his f@@ lange hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one of them had Robert Le@@ ave owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ideal ye Brown struck the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct approval , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern moved to an indispensable game , it was able to put Piraeus needle .
at Tor@@ es@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was not a discount .
for example , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye on the rat ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola tried a four @-@ year chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it fine .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero after the final training had given a green light after the final training , Matthias Sam@@ son said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought a King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the prosecution ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ metres there was still a dr@@ one .
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly damaged Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ bloc apparently the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and ges@@ tures had prov@@ oked the security forces and went with bat@@ ons against the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , sh@@ uts down not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that is putting an Pots@@ dam@@ er long study .
the good news : without aband@@ on@@ ment , risk is risk fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to exceed the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
major causes for tooth decay to be tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , underline the authors .
the connection between cigarette smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent tooth fl@@ esh@@ are at smokers .
not clear , which increases the risk of tooth decay either .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risks but within a short period of time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard again sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the dust section Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people that this is to be understood by the DI@@ f@@ E , the study manager H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is reducing the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health up to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 years of dental treatment , DI@@ f@@ E shared with the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inning the findings .
archae@@ ologists met from Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from the late @-@ period

in the proximity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ eton and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said director of Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
since the start of construction on the Rhine , historians were looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always added as a trade office for Archae@@ ological soil preservation .
in the third phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists now became five .
text documents had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had been standing a church , explained triumph@@ s .
besides the remains of the fortress and the cherry or@@ age , a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs were discovered that probably belonged to the church .

European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
in the resolution of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which in its function is significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that trusted citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström from the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish delegation warned the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US @-@ free talks with the US .
the German Government announced support .
it is expected to create the largest free @-@ trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current refer@@ ral proceedings have been con@@ cre@@ tely shown that the EU states and the US select independent judges for a new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Investment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to impose violation of judgment .
up to now , the procedures involved with each other on refer@@ ee , a objection to the jud@@ g@@ ments , did not give it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice are not familiar , commented Malm@@ ström showed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own data on an International Investment Bank .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states could be clarified .
the investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings , most notably of the most important investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings , are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance to TTIP .
the traditional arbitration courts have been critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , about the company loss of damage to tax@@ payers , national laws under@@ tak@@ ings or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in their first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act announced the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate .
critic@@ ised has been particularly critici@@ zed that they are not intended to be tra@@ ded to the already negotiated trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Sch@@ nig ( SPD ) awarded the plans as big progress .
the Commission considered significant points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration depends on the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business association founded Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the charges of the economy will restrict its economy through too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be disadvantaged , it was called .
when the talks are concluded via the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , remain unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since the middle of 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the leader of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour president Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and made his debut for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six questions shortly after noon , while his performance from the media is likely to be examined by the media .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; in this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ite had prov@@ oked a memorial celebration at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence and stands at the core of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; an spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respectful still@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , talked in the BBC Two news night program , he has to sing the Labour president , to sing the national hy@@ m@@ n , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leading team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth party of the Parliam@@ entary Party originally supported him as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also takes place within the Labour Party , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements to the European Union &apos;s position and the limit for profitability .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said TU@@ C Conference , recent Labour to put changes in order to remove the whole idea of limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions ministers , said that the party &quot; is very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ on 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth British chair , which David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
the Labour president , which promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the question@@ ers of the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ ful , and that he will be subject to cross @-@ power &quot; and the fighting with resistance and instead has made a chance to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the shadows of economics , when he is not participating - for example , if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the dormit@@ ory , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to move from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the leader of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he adm@@ its that he failed .
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question@@ ers with the Prime Minister as the major bar@@ ometer of the Court and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament , although critics ar@@ gues that she has become a caricature and cautious reforms .

between May and July the result suffered without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest time ever since 2009 and brought about savings on the timing of a interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % in relation to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was shortened up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 44@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the take @-@ over of the rival AB In@@ w@@ v was received .
one deal would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
Bur@@ berry @-@ Shar@@ es were after encouraging news from the competition for luxury , ri@@ ms , and 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ alchem@@ y &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - came back growth again .

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages put the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK @-@ workers could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it was unlikely , however , that this purchasing force will be the higher labour of labour in his company , he says .
the cost might meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less extra jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ Medal gets Lebanese on potato @-@ tin@@ k@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or roofs ?
they are both - and in the potato dum@@ b which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ Movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat along with a mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he acci@@ dentally came on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then in his shop builds a barbecue which has been fitted with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural Music For the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has become the Lebanese 1968 in the Patent Office in Munich .
there she has been protected by the authority for a short while as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wer will contain , Al@@ ha@@ y wants to not betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds it even better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

met@@ cash launches position @-@ in campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ jection
met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A branches before an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a rehabilitation campaign in order to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , we strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as for Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers ski@@ pped on board , with brands like ice @-@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop @-@ owner , who sell tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual investor @-@ strategy game .
there is a lot in play as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of the Ig@@ A @-@ cargo business and generate higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ network in the eastern states .
the buyers were in South Australia and Western Australia have much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in eastern states .
however , analysts , such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di 12 months after opening its first markets cut some five percent of the food market in these two countries , and will take away all the existing players , but primarily autonomous retailers .
according to the report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath ra@@ ged by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million to be lost by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will start in WA in the next year , and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss in food and grocery store and in the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fix@@ ture could cost metast@@ ases about 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mostly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A &apos;s buyers are the most important .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in food and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably be inside a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
met@@ alised declined to react publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 percent , reflecting the operating debt reduction in steady pressure on sales and margins .
the wholesale distributor , however , inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to pay sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ms at hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by investing quickly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice is said that the price adjustment and shop renov@@ ations will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to come back to a profit growth .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ chin was supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ chin was one of the &quot; pa@@ thy damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Pay@@ gios and deserves praise as critics concerning his own behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ chin , the younger and talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compiled by the in@@ famous arguments of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in Montreal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in Cincinnati soon , Kok@@ chin wrote and his opponent managed to separated from the refer@@ ee twice , whereby the Harrison failed : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to sh@@ out , and I was to beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how to sh@@ attered a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a var@@ ic@@ l had picked up a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ kin@@ akis was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the sol@@ itary behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals on Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I endu@@ red quite well is the fact that , according to my view Than@@ asi a little has been drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost a death toll on US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around us , and I think he was treated a bit too severe .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never worked a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take into account at the key preced@@ ents that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , to come back as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was rapidly made the climb to see what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he has some bad mistakes and deserves to understand him . some time outside the ram@@ p , in which he can only contem@@ plate , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary says Emer@@ gency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary ob@@ serves the emergency and signed the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firm who tried to flee illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed on the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a no @-@ man @-@ land @-@ war and Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence were hidden for an unknown period of time in a landing stri@@ ps on the road between the two points of control of the countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations have been climbed .
as a police helicopter on them ho@@ vering , the migrants &quot; opens the border , &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian border police .
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Ministry stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral lateral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to take talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc with a meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for the 40,000 people who shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would ensure that the EU states would receive more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the economic crisis of the continent .
but Hungary won &apos;t put his hopes for a full action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
the emergency resort was held on Tuesday in two southern regions with greater powers to tackle the crisis , so that they susp@@ end roads and accelerate the road for asylum .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed dra@@ h@@ um along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after it ended up a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ assen with the competition to create the Stak@@ han@@ dra@@ b fence between Hungary and Serbia .
Hungary for many war migrants from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and input point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Viktor Or@@ ban has existed but the majority of incoming economic migrants are on the search for a better life , and not for war crimes , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the sh@@ ame@@ ful of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , which left the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher custody for condemned people of men .
&quot; due to the situation , which was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come from , by damaging the fence , they are now in police @-@ courts and will be accused of being accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are calling the fence quickly to repair .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border out@@ puts with Serbia , after a train carri@@ ages with bar@@ bed @-@ wire , to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the main border crossing close to ro@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and thrust the crowd to settle down there .
some 20 managed to get into it , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election in 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win you towards the ground .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the preceding elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders stands in second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced himself for the presidential office , is supported by 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the onset of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ ics are more enduring than those of the other candidates in their choice .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost in a series of demographic groups while S@@ anders had achieved some profits .
Clinton is holding a big edge over women and moder@@ ates , but these models have diminished .
your support for the men has decreased dras@@ tically , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters under the age of 50 have become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a big edge over the older di@@ ps .
in the past month Clinton had been a double @-@ cylinder head start with the liber@@ als , but S@@ ander has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the EU elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some worries and another 15 per cent would only support because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it is not surprising that Clin@@ ics and current supporters can benefit most of all of you .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently not support Clinton - only about one fourth place would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election say that Clinton is supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters do this about their peak performance , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) .
when Clin@@ ics are asked in an open question , why they want it is the most common response that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
at Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters , your connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with problems and constitu@@ encies are also cited .
as the Vice President raises the potential for the presidential office to the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the pro @-@ elections would like to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ er is asked by an election , who for the Party was their second choice is Bi@@ den at the helm .
of Clin@@ ics &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ ke@@ wers were their second choice far ahead of S@@ otherwise .
decide for bi@@ den not to channel for the Democrats &apos; nom@@ ination , Hill@@ ary Clinton has stepped up against s@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the competition to 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five per cent of democratic voters do consider Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election , but this figure has declined from 78 per cent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measure , but the percentage he sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , democratic vot@@ er ask questions about the voters .
similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potenti@@ eller of candidate have emerged as unacceptable to these voters of the pres@@ election .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristic of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
these maj@@ orities consider Clinton , s@@ anders and bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership @-@ qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts down among the three candidates most well with honesty while Clin@@ ics is strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not think of him .
the democratic voters of the pres@@ election in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ an ideological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , approximately one quarter of democratic voters gave up no opinion of S@@ anders .
because you have questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s usage of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term in office , most Democratic voters of the elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , whereas only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , just after the problem came to light split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail chec@@ ker had no impact on its overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion was still worse .
they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say their views are increasingly bad .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy of the voters of the party , this is still an issue for them by un@@ registered voters in total : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote hold them not to be honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 per cent of the pro@@ sel@@ y@@ ans also see b@@ ump than not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump are nevertheless getting good notes on leadership .
of the six peti@@ ol@@ aters , bi@@ kers , Car@@ son and Bush t@@ ab the best with honesty .
a majority looks rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have any opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is searching for a nationwide survey , close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s latest survey - C@@ BS News / New York Times is close to Donald Tr@@ ump
due to the two candidates , half of the support of the elec@@ torate will fall into the new survey , and others lose more dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers in a large number . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l , which was conducted in front of Fox news debate last month , in order to 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son wei@@ ghed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son is well received in demographic groups and Tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed on Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of early Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins nor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest , with 10 % support over the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % in third place .
the fault @-@ mar@@ row in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son will rise in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed a pump sign in front of Car@@ son .
with a view of one during the last week @-@ rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found several si@@ gh@@ posts for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to ask Tr@@ umps in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a check @-@ out in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if the top values are measured only in the distance , for swimming pool already enough to find a trip to the Mediterranean in order to find even more warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some goes no longer into the sea : maximum 18 degrees , the water in the north and Baltic Sea are included in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures still provides the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College group .
almost two years after a student at a multi @-@ channel ritual , a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ me will be filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ PSI leaders attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during the interim period in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said that he had been stra@@ ined with his eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ru@@ cks@@ ack with sand , and repeatedly been attacked while trying to go beyond a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g did not complain about headaches , then he was unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta in the failed assass@@ ins were not calling the emergency number , after Den@@ g was powerless and waited an hour before she brought him into a hospital , thus the police .
however , they had the time to transition to Den@@ g &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to intervene , &quot; said Political dict@@ ator Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and provided the good of the Brotherhood , in principle , about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Political We@@ av@@ en@@ in Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his wounds .
after an automatic update , Den@@ g is repeated with bl@@ unter power injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the vic@@ tors of the Brotherhood . at least a student died since 1970 every year at the Schi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents Den@@ g &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this move from government is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment because of the third grades for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with Shi@@ p@@ ous attacks and a criminal unification .
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially or un@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accountable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood ab@@ re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a ti@@ p@@ raise comes , and the house@@ top will get into the bed@@ side , ren@@ unciation of bonds will rise , and the economy will be in a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long all this will take and how long it will hold .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only small steps to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve with raising the interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in what the economy and the financial investments are responding .
therefore , representatives from the US Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement could possibly be exaggerated because of a raise .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest on normal heights , but still too low levels to fear for se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historical trend @-@ based look on how some areas of the economy may react :
as the market has seen last month , the intake of Zin@@ ser@@ rate can be volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase does not meet , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments from 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be shortened which might be reflected in monetary policy again , &quot; said German @-@ bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after Zin@@ ser@@ ums of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually during the past 35 years in heating , fairly flat during the last 35 years ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield over the past six past cycles , according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief press k@@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the down@@ turn @-@ cycle and the return result begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic growth , but Zin@@ ser@@ increases they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product near its lowest point will be the F@@ ed &apos;s lowest point .
according to Deutsche Bank , according to Deutsche Bank there were only twice the nominal GDP in 1950 to 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , very few people expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in a so @-@ called economic setting could be risky and cast the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s been different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
participants have taken the whole year on a p@@ raise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in that week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ C@@ MC could be approved at this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading requires only a 25 percent increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the enh@@ ancements from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are placed quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record has been 35 months and these are so far 74 months .
the firm income was also volati@@ le because the market occupies an interest raise and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds while bonds are faster than those with shares that change their strategic course .
the bonds seem to change the rendering time as soon as the first increase in lowering the cycle is performed .
at the end of the down@@ tro@@ dden cycle the bond ou@@ ghs immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will result in bringing closer ties to bonds closer to a curve and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come analy@@ st at pigs , in an analysis .
interesting is Jones that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indication that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the portable len@@ ght is fl@@ atter , borro@@ wing has increased and the volati@@ lity - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in large and wider , businesses that benefit most of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , because an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks &quot; inclined to react very positively , three months after a initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed the balance sheet by 5 percentage points after each of the p@@ inn@@ ings in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
company with high capital render , as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares , their counterparts are compared with low quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ er could see gains from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how soon it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable by commercial Rival .
he also addressed the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliamentary group Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the program The Voice and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliament and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something what the private stations does not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards who started out in December .
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seems to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate , the alleg@@ ations pointed back , and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to public @-@ music and enlightenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I would like to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music , which is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and order new works , I consider it really important . &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to engage with the audience is to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , was taken under fire to hit the commercial Rival upon their feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached The Voice to - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a valued cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a particular way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it started a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice to the future or give money by the animation for other sub@@ ordinate formats .
Internet str@@ ing@@ ed went in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the Chron@@ icle in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the editions .
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
yet experts say that there are now signs that online conver@@ sions are stagn@@ ant , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest possible increase in growth since the start of the Chron@@ icle in 2000 with only five percent on the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ant after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the rates of growth for the years and go back until 2000 , then it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online purchases turned out three years ago , when buyers began working with their mobile phones purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sh@@ utt@@ ling , and we may possibly see that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing conver@@ sions .
experts believe that buyers have their sh@@ opp@@ ings at the event occurring in November last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers were around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealers attack are stor@@ med .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were cont@@ ested because of bar@@ gains , buyers , buyers that could prevent sh@@ opp@@ ings .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has been discovered that a total of 5 £ had been published online for a bit more than £ 1 .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion cities .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch will go to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden @-@ Group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the sick , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of decre@@ es , which was published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the message agency reported this detail , but it said that the management of the company abroad was forbidden .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was revealing what caused the overthrow of the crane , who rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen over is over
British employ more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increase in itself
this leads to 200 other screens , which aim at craftsmen , are opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales People will close so far
from Ru@@ pert Stro@@ an , City boss @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British should carry out their lam@@ bs and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work done in their home
if you are sent with a m@@ alle@@ us or a brush to head of walls , you belong to a minority nowadays .
because the British are more craftsmen to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new secretary of King@@ fis@@ her , who possesses the build @-@ markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , services that offer deep @-@ price offer is now outdated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her starts to open two more scre@@ am shops , which attach to crafts and to close up to 60 retail outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women .
in the moment they l@@ ou@@ twei@@ gh the men the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that had more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we need to postp@@ one this stronger towards a balance .
princip@@ ally , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British working in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also turned their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women on our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her stopped a decline in half @-@ year &apos;s profit and revenues , after the group rep@@ lic@@ ated the costs for the closing of the stores .

the def@@ endants do not have found himself inno@@ cent .
one of them had been charged with mass abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to senior management members , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in 2006 until 2011 were mon@@ ies by the accounts used in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is more than 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial obligations .

the sports function@@ aries would have had only allowance damage and the sports club , for whom it had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , carried out of debt by about 600@@ ,000 p@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or do we block it ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in a snack &apos;s big business audi@@ tor of the financial system .
he was decided to take this task together with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our life insurance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executed as security at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the submission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely ; it must not be made any debt .
suff@@ erer - with the appropriate financial - success the payout of the allowance had been determined retro@@ sp@@ ectively until 1991 .
therefore , one contains a portion of the allowance for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore also l@@ ump and un@@ deta@@ il@@ ations , explained the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and the business books put together the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the deposits of the association were not detailed in detail , the judge asked .
the society would not be interested in the details of the financial crisis , important to have been the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 against the official investigations of abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
these were appropri@@ ations , said the def@@ endants .
this exp@@ on@@ ation went to the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to its statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
and the respon@@ dents did not answer for a long time .
then he said he did believe that this is the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor had in the room .
the accused did not have been informed ; legally , the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims . &quot;
why damage ? , they wanted to know a judge and a prosec@@ utor .
it was the first def@@ endant that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never done any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore said the functional , he never paid a pen@@ ny content , he only reck@@ on o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
he added to diets that he added to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expense was however much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years were not able to indicate the def@@ endants .
these were after a operational checking in which everything was judged as properly and not stored longer , they explained .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had referred to the second def@@ endant .
all Beh@@ eb@@ ations are made in cash , in order to do so , by his residence , to lead to the bank according to the place of worship , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on September 23 with the question@@ ing of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ ranges more 30,000 jobs

the broad@@ casting at the US @-@ computer ri@@ pen He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) has no end .
the U.S. technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate client base during its restructuring .
in this way , costs amoun@@ ted to $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , shared with the company on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special exer@@ tion of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .

R@@ ös@@ ch : violence of violence at a Persian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has put deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water lights against several hundred ac@@ ron@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has co @-@ witnessed the force of violence at the border control point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees interrupted the limit .
behind the police there was a police station and behind the polic@@ emen was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started off with stones , st@@ aves , and plastic bottles by officials .
the officials were initially interrupted and spray .
after this the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
many sh@@ ame@@ ans was pri@@ zed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now settled a bit .
a pregnant and evi@@ dently neglected wife was carried away out of the zone .
children who had con@@ ned the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried out .

time to decide on interest rates for the US Not@@ en@@ bank
the world observed when the US @-@ not@@ ary bank will meet on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists found by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half that was last week that F@@ ed would do so now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it &apos;s seven years since the F@@ ed interest is on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly start the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ her@@ bi@@ des , director of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook to global conditions .
it has warned the markets to raise to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of taking such a step is good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
finishing scor@@ er at the Delta State University checked by apologi@@ zing for
after the shoot and the sounds of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he started his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to tell him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry about the first murder and , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they announced that they announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s lecturer for geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and said , he l@@ acked on someone and someone was killed .
he said the staff of the not@@ with@@ standing , that the police should send polic@@ emen to his home .
he said , &quot; I frigh@@ ten my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he said also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; no one will interfere , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give it .
he did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police stood the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ er , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it again .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman she ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note he took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he was E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen will surround him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that &apos;s supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good human being . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from the age of 15 , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; o &apos; Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss asked her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ap@@ ss worked online from home , after the statement of L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pr@@ enti@@ er .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , who had been hearing with Lamb for about three years now .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said he had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he went off his car to the side , ran away on foot , ran into the forest and k@@ ills himself with a shot .
he received a PhD in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his academic article on the website of the University .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United may not play months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture in his right B@@ one at the Champions League of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
while this we@@ eping the left margin of sight to tears and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope for Sha@@ w to play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was given nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will drive tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then performed surgery in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you &apos;ve got a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of a g@@ ime .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alize the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card could be due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken up , my path to recovery begins now , I will come back more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
taken to : Manchester United acquired the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at defeat at PS@@ V
the United Kingdom of England has an added incentive to recover from the European Championship in France .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the square with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg @-@ down when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball who was in a different direction , so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 Moreno : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very badly there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child likes a book , it won &apos;t take long before you get it almost mem@@ orization .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , to name his favorite child &apos;s book , the Minister of Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead resume a content movie of the movie Version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the surrounding city Th@@ u @-@ Ville , where all nature walks and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , to see the girl of his dreams , &quot; read , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Bill@@ uss ho@@ und was arrested and died in 1991 .
as if this is not more suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially reading about the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is appearing on the website of Internet Movie database , where all is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named El@@ dre@@ y hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ bable the action of the book is so little familiar . here , an un@@ married boy , like the local environment through the monetary gre@@ edy , trees sli@@ pping , sn@@ ur@@ ped left @-@ ler , despite the protests of the well @-@ called Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ur@@ ped creatures , &quot; that is speaking on behalf of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax to a child every 20 times .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably right by Cameron &apos;s electoral campaigns .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons was supplied , but was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expulsion from England , but it is still difficult
b@@ ump in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res in England for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my card .
I would not make a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ause page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting order , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball being developed Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test plane , is an option for the attack .
in this case , Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to permit Adam poetry , of course to me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that your so@@ cket@@ players are oriented towards results .
there were no frac@@ tional sign in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their very best selection .
a long time ago , the run of Ly@@ th would be prolonged , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopes to get more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire it will come another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and it surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test tape receives , to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son prior to him - while Nick Comp@@ ton had got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and backwards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England was at first Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in limits - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a head@@ man I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ book , which we saw with Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he met 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very well .
he must obtain at least the same chances as the one before him , but of course this depends on the team &apos;s performance in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would achieve an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would come up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket @-@ player .
Mor@@ een has maybe not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before in 2001 as an Open@@ er .
he has made three hundred us@@ ur@@ ts immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is coming to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach to him , he was impressed me as a young man .
people might look at their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a point but there is no big number of a backup spi@@ der which raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew England has made a few smart additions to the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Pi@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nicest sol@@ ves of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is set for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet to the setup .
I &apos;ve always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the news in line with the previously said .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot won a similar break against Australia and for my part I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team sets do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken light heart .
the Bre@@ xit the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of the UK from the EU ) might gain access if the economy gets into a flu@@ ff in 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ figured out strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper trouble with any day even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jer@@ emy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which was fi@@ erc@@ ely crus@@ hed for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at was curious , saying that some member states , so deeply moved into different crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own fault , Great Britain itself , named agenda with split concessions and interfer@@ ing changes that they mostly do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are climbing at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves to a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , coming home and say that they are allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; literally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not only with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets look up that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials came to the point on which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years now and wants to leave the ministry before it looks bad for her , as it has happened during the excessive span like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading power .
Poland probably soon had a nationalist political government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they will be able to tear down one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s release from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , maybe some such ministers may even fail to share undes@@ irable comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s paper start to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boyfriend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation .
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their own costs and which EU @-@ scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the Press @-@ bar@@ one , as they carried out by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational speech of 1975 but did not , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember being weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro Opport@@ un@@ ists who made a name for themselves as a &quot; EU bar@@ ade &quot; of Brussels &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
to this end , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing S@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ et countries and the pseudo @-@ member states that own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Blair is similar to her , but asked to know that when one is sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you put better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him , instead of returning to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ er than Blair itself , when he was opposed by Mr Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Blair has res@@ isted the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press never lost him .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n gave me a friendly little shy at my back on Monday - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any more time for me to waste - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott mur@@ ky Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but it needs to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s official position to Europe is - I press it at times - in development .
he said that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional bl@@ iss@@ ant tendency and the wild fil@@ tering of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably tell everybody about that .
it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; An Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the Pf@@ aud has strug@@ gled in him , not to conce@@ de that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment by John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father was on television to lay loyal towards his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and losing its cabinet @-@ job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , &quot; nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night .
whatever the touching bottom image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is true , Cameron can give no open card for Europe who allows him to sustain Lab@@ our@@ &apos;s support in the campaign campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell .
Simon Jen@@ kins think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n fundamental activities relating to EU membership - in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite sie@@ ge economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the an@@ is@@ m@@ atism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ mati@@ tis .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities and Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats are obliged to attempt to find a sense of their superior .
why should Paris or Berlin be squ@@ ander@@ ing political capital - they have mis@@ leading voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be poin@@ tless ?
the U.S. is already quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ lowering of the T@@ ory government &apos;s power , which I reminded at the start of the Monday of what was called British Poker Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) who made criticism of The Lanc@@ et of Public Health England ( phe ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes used .
phic released the &quot; replacement report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month called the &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; on which it wor@@ ship@@ pers the most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &quot; can build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health and Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic@@ al Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the identification of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the proposition of pan@@ es that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes have about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ subject criteria ( multi @-@ c@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting , funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer to receive , but not the funding he said following reports by the Tab@@ ak@@ e@@ er Philip Morris international , added to them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco was taken part of an orph@@ ous part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or limitations in the phic report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of pan@@ es that &quot; there have so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes was used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well being at pan@@ es , said that the cont@@ en@@ tions of BM@@ J was previously re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in its addiction .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes can be low compared to that , however , that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs a national health system two billion pounds per year .
through the clear set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should abandon East@@ En@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Rival will be their right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programmes that were not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly known for public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in a hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and by stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Direc@@ torate @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years during his time with Channel 4 without success , to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly displayed by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Upper House of Communications at the BBC on the Future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the radio fee , which in medium or long term does not consider a good idea , one should at least give up production to programs , the others do not make or commissioned .
they send the Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this would be a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s of course nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax system which could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly thoroughly re@@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to this .
but I compelled to see how this is to be public @-@ ri@@ cious TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entreprene@@ ur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments about the most popular programmes of the BBC give once again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation at Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ cal programs &quot; go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t gau@@ ge the audience , but they meet their tasks , and they could argue if they have created on their hypo@@ cris@@ s to the justification of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the round@@ ing fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather lively system in terms of conditions which can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think of all , we think that one receives a great value for 150 £ a year , but for those who are paid for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chef David El@@ stein , who said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their ge@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educate and entertain . &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should take up the public @-@ law TV broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television are shown and enter with the commercial channels to make everything available online .
&apos; Other Get &apos; may control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ mat@@ odes will change the direction of the moment in which they can be illuminated by sound impul@@ sion .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ mat@@ odes are changing the direction for the moment in which they can be heard with sound impulses , which for the human hearing are too high frequencies to be heard .
the stim@@ uli work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
others on this topic : to read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ ases , using ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ es Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , CA , said the Guardian that one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which gives electrical impulses to the brain &apos;s symptoms to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
f@@ aded wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani indicated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then inv@@ ade into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the acou@@ sti@@ ers create the opening of these ion@@ ization channels and enable the cells to which they are allocated , such a report Nature Communications .
to establish ultras@@ ound controlled ne@@ mat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ c@@ ann@@ ons is carried out TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion @-@ channels .
if he applies ultras@@ ound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ blo@@ wers and transmit to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ c@@ ann@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ Get , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows neur@@ ons with impulses of light to turn off and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Other comments could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent to the desired point in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound sensors can be detected and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that by gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

8 Golden rules for life in school residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ for@@ get@@ ary 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ et and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have been angry - and on the numerous , long @-@ voiced complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the train in school residen@@ ces varies from slightly nerve rac@@ er up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to to@@ ddle : people tell where you are coming , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ter , where you are , in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ kt ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - place ask questions and show you interested .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , unlike those you would not speak , even if your lashes would rent in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract themselves and their under@@ wear .
to refer to : do not think about starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted gives a crude treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residence forms a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I will continue our friendship , but you have to go away , that I can hold the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense whenever a class@@ one is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it a text instead to knock .
apro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes with b@@ aking .
since you start at the university at the height of back @-@ Man@@ ie , the knock on the doors of people to ima@@ g@@ ining himself with a plate full of navig@@ ating , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve b@@ lown it to you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to entertain yourself and will end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an ever @-@ in b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and gre@@ ase cause people to sleep sound@@ ing when you cli@@ pped .
ste@@ aling to ste@@ al is a common crime in school residen@@ ces .
of course the cla@@ ws of chicken is a lar@@ cen@@ y , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good they say to serve themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the interior .
if any one ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate who added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from their sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent man , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb , to the people that sit in the glass house .
a girl in my hallway asked their neighbors , if it makes them something , drum &amp; bass to put something qui@@ eter on it , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they react to this with still loud music .
when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she had kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before she closed her own music , shut her door and went away to her three @-@ hour test .
would it not romantic , if your future spouse would happen random@@ ly into the same dor@@ dormit@@ ory ?
the other way , it would not be extremely embarrassing for you to pause a room@@ mate for your future marriage , get involved in it and then have to see it every day and maybe together , how they all share our mutual friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if the hot mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ mines a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ locked room has allowed the border between a Ul@@ k and Bul@@ lying village , as it seems .
a good argument is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place through po@@ dge a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t forget one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door , and place your key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not refu@@ te their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ moving , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ sion@@ er
the real estate operator Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the center @-@ con@@ ian @-@ ian terrac@@ ed houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but as well as the mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still work well and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the residential area .
the entreprene@@ ur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are running on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the u@@ bi@@ ous accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people remain a great part here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the refugee stream , we also need plenty of space in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs more space .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if you put the people in living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house rises to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without a plot .
this is over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took time .
this is adequate .
do the construction regulations impose their plans rather complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : Bau@@ legal I have correctly held my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent dam , special construction and the slot regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still sub@@ signed , who creates three homes in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their ro@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who threw me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what &apos;s definitely not right .
but do not cut the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but newly built luxury apartments , which hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need shelter .
not only refugees but as well as the mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ erer .
I show how one can still find good and well @-@ built today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone operating system if Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after installation problems , since they get an error message telling it that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to byp@@ ass the issue , users is advised to either to wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the delete of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier through the recording of the update to be more likely . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worth not@@ ing that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the telephone may be switched between half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ wald is looking for direct contact

besides consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation is coming down from the hill to the city centre .
closer to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ place .
there was recently opened a new qu@@ arti@@ sti@@ ce office .
here , directly next to the purchasing market , you can immediately obtain sen@@ iors and advice on issues such as care insurance or services of health care insurance .
for years we have realised with our out@@ patient care service , that frequently , nur@@ turing individuals are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; they too often do not claim many benefits of the insur@@ ers because the complexity of insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new landlord @-@ chief geri@@ atic support also for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil @-@ Hospital , and for the patient @-@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; is responsible .
in addition to the consultation , the new qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ ery office offers also prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , one can use additional offers such as storm @-@ prevention , remin@@ ders or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the old town centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precaution and rehabilitation .
&quot; the first house centre for care and care , &quot; told Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .

men report on 17 @-@ year Afgh@@ ans a
witnesses are searching for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 00 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den toward Sal@@ mu@@ ster .

Dr Frank Müller takes over field breaks and invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber ausen .
also , Sam@@ t@@ ein@@ deb@@ tors Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ sal Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand was lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice at the end of October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing up to his successor for the next few months .
after a renovation phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro into the premises on St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was a great interest in the first glance , when the rim of the years Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently takes their professional education in the dedicated hospital and wants to get into practice again .
&quot; we always had in mind that the trav@@ eller would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was so , I was simply called . &quot;
the couple of Mu@@ eller fell the idea of running our own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients is very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to experience and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he sees also to be his own boss , soon .
and so one was agreed , the Mü@@ llers also bought the house with the practice .
you will stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is a two @-@ time family father Frank Müller as well as grown up in medical studies in Hanover , followed by medical studies in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
currently he is working as a captain in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior patient in Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z in 2009 and is engaged in honorary in the DRC @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting on 19th September the practice for the new head will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Se@@ aling ausen as a veterin@@ arian works , his spouse has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) on Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to settle as pets .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and lo@@ stress @-@ EK@@ GS , and need a consultation room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Mü@@ llers will receive a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros as part of a subsi@@ ding program of the District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; said Sam@@ t@@ ein@@ deb@@ tors Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , occur every quarter in the practice of rock @-@ breaks , in the North @-@ German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another holiday experience .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
whoever is visited with an hour @-@ hour and continues to be primarily in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rim .
the departure ends at A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors spent 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mun@@ ic@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness , they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ moor and many patients will certainly see it yet , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband added laughing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pushed me down to gardening , now it could become different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grandchildren and sisters gladly .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will be lifted up at our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it was clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application , that could also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and safety of the people are the main objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there should be clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migrant currents , also not to the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is contempl@@ ating &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously announced Slovenia wants to continue travelling to Germany and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances will establish cor@@ ridors for refugees .
however , this saw the Interior Minister of Ves@@ na mor@@ ör@@ kö@@ s in Lai@@ bach , but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is said to intensify the monitoring of the border , especially Hungary - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled by the Schengen area .
like the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to cut out its borders for refugees but not dis@@ sem@@ bled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member needs to fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ ör@@ heads in Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to go on Tuesday to Tuesday to go over to the border crossing the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d border to escape the registration .
the Croatian police could catch them up in the near ma@@ is@@ fields .
the local media has ever met police vehicles with new refugees in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days counting his country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
also , from Pres@@ ses on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , who have so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade hold it to make it possible to include attri@@ bution , to include certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , it is in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , during the course of the day further buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night from the roughly 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has committed , so the police added us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to go to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus , in fact , it could actually commit to the forec@@ ast@@ ed shift of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for cross @-@ control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic noted that his country for the fall of a strong flow of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible outcomes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further details he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got comprehensive ways to limit the border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since gone through a good testimony to the country , regarding the standard of border controls .
on small side , behind the Hungarian border fence , approximately 300 refugees continue to set .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border out@@ puts of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully locked .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday night at a local attack in Hor@@ gos : he maintains the debates about aging populations from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at this time not take a huge deal of refugees .
one cannot say whether or not they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers of migrants to - dangerous - aging
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to spread to the refugees of land , where alternative routes are in place through Croatia .
the border re@@ occurs between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in sections of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining companies in the border region was sent .

in total , investig@@ ators were killed over a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately to be caught &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other alleg@@ ations in the case held up @-@ to @-@ date .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are expected to act in both the US and Eastern Europe .

the &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic Hosp@@ ic@@ ie continued by this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary , and certainly sees itself confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we are walking in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ic@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available to the pas@@ sers in questions and talks like the volunteers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some Pass@@ ant appeared spontaneously to chal@@ k , and watched the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read , &quot; with the camper managed by the USA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not endure long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue reading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over and over again , the si@@ delines are small discussions on the action , about life , dealing with the death .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is right on the spot .

hence , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to share the table publicly , but be understandable , finally , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although just the Hosp@@ it@@ ous Movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , Fin@@ anz outlook for 2016 tri@@ mm@@ ed
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ closing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ gi@@ ant sen@@ ded his chances for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his field service .
the company also said that she is planning to invest around 5@@ 5,000 of the season for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the Company wants to adapt the 50,000 season for the holiday season .
the share fell on 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected to be a survey by Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the reduced view comes despite the price increases , which are average of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January , and despite increased failures for bo@@ d@@ war@@ horses from heavy and large boxes , which are collected from November .
the company said that it was nonetheless expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income , and because of the growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said , that the company produces &quot; solid yields in consideration of the weaker economic conditions , in particular in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the ri@@ vals U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million were cancelled , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the result of the share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research said analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks tested the analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has noticed a decline at international pri@@ zep@@ pelin disp@@ at@@ ching which brought our sales to the end of its unity .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the field flight increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit increases higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , at 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen st@@ acked two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether or not it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the helm .
ch@@ asti@@ ly about them at an end of the reduced , two @-@ story par@@ atory sa@@ vers is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order of the Congress : maximize the US employment and prices keep up here .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a no @-@ third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to become endor@@ sed by an unprecedented attraction through the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is growing , the recent turmoil on the global financial markets make the already more pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal government bonds - and be it only one quarter of percentage point .
&quot; in fact , the labor market and inflation is primarily the most important thing that they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if in search of a pretext , the interest rate was not to increase , the increased insecurity about the global market is enough justification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , resulting in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists were recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a raise this week .
the financial markets , however , await the F@@ ed , with a key indication , showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike , by promising that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ s@@ worth to 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed &apos;s policy keeps the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate insecurity on when the F@@ ed will act .
just a month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shor@@ tening of the mon@@ otherapy which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als that would be necessary more economic progress in this year , an increase in the sentence anticipated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the creation of jobs in August slow , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate sank from 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed as full employment views .
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation constantly ran under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist with pan@@ theon in Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world reach out the end of the last month , after China had conquered its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average B was set out in May for more than 16 % below its top level , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would increase the global growth .
the market has recovered something in this month , the Dow is now almost 10 % below the May of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influences the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weaknesses of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would outline authority at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former colleague of the US Not@@ an bank .
now he says that she will wait at least a month to better get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there is almost no reliable sources , which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy of the global economy is one of the leading victims of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the central bank has an enormous influence over the past few years .
the mere note of the former Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed was able to for@@ ge their mon@@ e@@ after expansion &quot; dissolved , solve confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor the developments elsewhere , but also advice on other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , realised this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial markets , which seems to be linked to the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
L@@ acker , a legitimate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a interest rate , decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limiting the impact on growth in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ed this cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only to the first place during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil do not come close to this plane , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an interest raise , because the markets become ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ated , &quot; P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still does not contain the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
you are welcome to enjoy a warm welcome , not without the commitment of a volunteer volunteer .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole lot of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ ein is with body and soul teacher .
even with her 74 L@@ enz@@ es she is still giving pleasure .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum @-@ office at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there she will help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
naturally , the whole of other lessons is regarded as at the right school .
Brazilian Bi@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande encourage nutrition for healthy breastfeeding .
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS temp@@ ted to clear how important good nutrition during the breastfeeding period is . it does this with the presentation of paintings of babies , who are connected with representations of unhealthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that provide babies with all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the extra energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake are not the only dietary adaptation should be carried out .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , demonstrated that a healthy diet wa@@ vered women actually protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der spor@@ thal
the Council of the Council of Bern@@ ried by launching the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ key at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ site come step by step forward : in the recent council meeting , the executed building contract has been s@@ acked without major discussions .
earlier , the committee also decided on a application for a structural &quot; exception &quot; and &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; of the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was the permission to obtain a special form on the roof construction .
according to this statement , a &quot; semi @-@ roof with no @-@ part first and roof @-@ roof is said to be established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the umbrella for solar generators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we get a wonderfully large South Korea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; liberation &quot; once again we went to the sky@@ line which is for energy reasons - different from the development plan below - under ten degrees are to lie .
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore needed , because the development plan with respect to the roof ink@@ age has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ic@@ ose of the com@@ mons in the rule of fre@@ eing is more restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however at the turn@@ around , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports center at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of roughly 2.3 million euros are calculated .
supplements are expected from school and grass@@ roots funding .
in the next process , the building entry for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now has been presented to the Council for testing .
Klinik Pl@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to St@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff moved by P@@ ei@@ gh berg with to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
this see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , the land@@ owners Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed .
however , a decision on the board of the Supervisory Board , and the will conven@@ es the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would drive on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should go to Sch@@ on@@ gau , with fishermen and the continued new Inner Station .
the rooms are present .
the staff who can not go to Sch@@ on@@ gau , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the beginning and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
in the question of who the succession is to be followed , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game , who volunte@@ ered to take over the management and moves with his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means a &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; and a broader range of the offer in &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
S@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
in addition to the next two years , Fischer will agree with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees with its team , which currently holds over 35 beds , which has still more than 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years is to be closed .
so far , the District has planned this for 2018 , when the current reconstruction in the hospital was completed in Wei@@ l@@ heim .
Land@@ qu@@ ad Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , presents rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I conclude that &quot; how it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites could not say , there are several reflections .
currently there is a short time care of car@@ itas and a tag@@ esp@@ ur .
&quot; what happ@@ enings could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who has been positively and very understanding by the staff . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a che@@ et@@ aker for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to assume the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly under threat of closure , departments were closed , for example , the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lion is required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 am ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the German hand@@ lers of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal as a clear favorite , occasion for sur@@ facing does not exist however .
in the past season the ba@@ ener spent a sore defeat at the B@@ HC and made something good there .
hunting Fig@@ ure with two Ver@@ ses at Pr@@ at@@ au
two motor@@ cyclists are wounded during their ma@@ is@@ ling on the Tuesday afternoon by means of shots .
during the Aber@@ n@@ tens at a ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ lord of Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police dealt .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered grave injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could get to the accident was first unclear .
the C@@ ID is determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
an susp@@ ects has led the police to Lei@@ che the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people got killed and their ly@@ re was thrown into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen .
a couple of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is fallen victim to violent crimes .
the sur@@ pl@@ che of young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern , such as Pro@@ sec@@ utor and police at Wednesday told .
as over@@ head suspi@@ cion , an also taken on the Tuesday evening , 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who put in fact the statement , and carried out the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missed on Sunday mor@@ nings , after having arrived at home on the eve of a autumn in rock enh@@ ausen , not how made it come home .
in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators took the investigation into personal objects of the victim .
with surveys in the friends and acquaint@@ ances of the ma@@ sts , eventually , a crime took place against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the suspect cul@@ pr@@ it then led the police to a channel in rock enh@@ ausen where the ly@@ che was found .
the authorities approved the authorities in law to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old , and have put the cor@@ pse into the channel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre @-@ guided on Wednesday at the port &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haf@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the investig@@ ators lay it away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the near@@ ness of circumstances , the further investigation should be carried out .
refugees need accommodation : study warn against housing estates
the location on the German apartment market is tense .
more and more refugees search for affordable st@@ ale .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing stands in front of a challenge .
distribution units in the German apartment market have long since started .
with the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are ur@@ ging on a market that is now en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed in many big cities .
they compete with in@@ competitive citizens around the last pay@@ able apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , we would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
this outcome comes as a study on the mission of the association &quot; social housing &quot; housing .
to compare : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this is missing 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in a first week of accommodation .
many come across the flat market and turn to the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats for rent .
according to statistics , however , last year there was less than half of all asylum seekers .
the negative development of the housing market lies , however , not only due to the increasing counts of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany sho@@ ve an apartment deficit from the year , which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently in the ball@@ ads have already been around 7@@ 7@@ 50,000 housing units , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals involved therefore have dwelt in major cities in W@@ G rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tarily sted in the apartment market because of the flu@@ ff in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per head has declined again in recent years .
to solve the problem , the coalition of &quot; social housing &quot; is propos@@ ing a new start .
new incentives should spur the social housing structure again .
this could be avoided on the under@@ scoring tax and the property tax will be initially issued for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
in addition , alliances must be attractive tax @-@ needed de@@ preci@@ ation .
the funding programme for refugee camps of the Kf@@ W is now working well in cities and villages .
a good week after the start was held on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the EUR 300 million were already de@@ ported .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free payments : Croatia and Slovenia are set corridor .
there is practically no more through@@ put in Hungary , as more and more refugees pick the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces to allow the transit of Slovenia to the north without any hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to establish itself with the neighbour of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian internal minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia are broken to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television @-@ channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had gone on its border for refugees on the day of the day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , they do practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum in Hungary .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however , men who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU @-@ neighboring Croatian border .
most of them were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and with Ta@@ xen to the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she would have tried to walk on the Croatian border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees fail to reach border fence .
this poses other dangers for this : there are shar@@ pen@@ ed mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , in@@ comes after the closing of the border almost more refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday the police were 3@@ 66 of the people .
in short before the door on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overthrow and damaging the border tell us as a criminal offen@@ se .
in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore have been developed 35 criminal proceedings .
the squ@@ ander@@ ing arrest warran@@ t up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration office , on Tuesday in the new at the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sitz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was accepted across the borders of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sitz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday nearly all - 93 - most importantly - the most important transition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ös@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
there were still 40 refugees te@@ asing on Wednesday morning .
practically nobody has allowed me to get a view on Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to regulate things up .
they gathered the garbage to leave the tens of thousands of people in the streets of the road@@ side .
cur@@ ra@@ ils have been demol@@ ished and one of the recording @-@ camps in the Grenz@@ ort has been converted .
as the objective of this re@@ building no one wanted to express himself .
Austria reached a short distance after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants are still staying in the country , but still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for their journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ way regularly meet smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor also drove the &quot; sh@@ in@@ ate &quot; over the borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were on Sunday at the bridge on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were working with rice at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly heavy on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow of railway traffic with Austria , it was in Wern@@ stein concluded , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we have had the un@@ hoped @-@ for guests only once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ ver@@ ages .
we said equal , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ eco @-@ conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to pass a generous donation , 100 Euro for the fire@@ fighters .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening , the boats in Germany were moving from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au . after the short notice , it was taken to arrive at the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was stopped in front of the Wern@@ stein am Inn until the Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the border is generally high in the process .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ exer@@ ted sports - organised by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent more tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a sha@@ ved policy :
instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help build structures that guarantee Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor continued to state up @-@ date and publicly adopted the position of the Hungarian government in the dark @-@ circle of National Socialism .
bearing in this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are facing the border areas with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gh@@ oul@@ try will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they have invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a huge challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , where decent conditions for protective seekers .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ ing Quar@@ terly
finally , Con@@ rad has fully lost all hands with the flood .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has installed the former powerful Rai@@ ffe@@ isen @-@ bankers to release torture for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ time Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got the grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
also , the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot;
the Interior Ministry was however of a &quot; crisis @-@ worthy situation . &quot;
overall , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the hot year .
to meet the number , will have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations over the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide those countries employing 15.000 to the Bund .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the members of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him both even for the coming refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbour@@ hoods &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born in order to be trans@@ figured as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations continues the asylum Co@@ ordinator as well in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also possible to offer private individuals and accommodations .
also , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of times , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ gi@@ ers must respect a certain amount of hand@@ ch@@ stick @-@ ers or the size of the di@@ ligence .
for a temporary period of time , &quot; Emer@@ gence &quot; must be considered .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful in keeping with his experience .
I am an older gentleman , that one does not without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally , Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er cause no costs as they explained themselves .
their head@@ count would have to increase it to three to four .
your own property search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the square Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but , there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
there is no opening of municipal sports centres and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plans to enter the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment because it can accommodate the persons currently without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
at the end of the emergency , further sites are to be examined for their vi@@ ability .
criticism of the city remains on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not gone . &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef Sei@@ stir@@ inger ( VP ) held on Monday the further action of the refugees .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders will not be un@@ settled .
the return of refugees to the Federal Republic was still possible .
however , there is now just the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special time to take with refugees to Germany .
the prot@@ esters would however have brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states called for even greater solidarity in the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads to its borders with controls , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commen@@ cement of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industri@@ er is officially complete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is reloc@@ ated , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is aimed at young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
it can imagine to invest in the Start@@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire which to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promised : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the company , 3,@@ 3 million euros of the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is grown from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented out , for a further 40 percent there may be requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni inhibit@@ or opened a second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ handles are the centre of attention .
actually J@@ utta wanted to take a dog for himself .
this project had to postp@@ one the 49 year @-@ old bankrupt@@ cy of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade ; after all , it has now been an increase in the form of another business trans@@ location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop in front of the shop , in which they sold among others bags , suitcase , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , now all around women &apos;s hand pockets of the brand fur@@ la , wal@@ lets are starting from 75 Euro .
larger pan@@ ni@@ ers and accessories for up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks changed .
&quot; but I have long above whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says wide .
decisive for the decision was among other things , that too , the ford @-@ producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of one &apos;s premises , where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the noble in Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has his own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been very broad from her mother to the cradle .
I contact me most when something is developing and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
why so some woman will be smiling at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tin , too , the professional wife can &apos;t respond with the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful pocket is evaluating every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ as@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants become called ver@@ er .
this property links also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exciting .
whether it is alien@@ ated from xen@@ ophobia , journalists bel@@ lows or kno@@ cks in international crises policy - the candidate for the US presidential stre@@ et@@ orium sp@@ ells up the fra@@ y vigor@@ ously .
and cutting off well with it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property @-@ halls came from .
the New Yorker who &apos;s ke@@ g@@ son is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ town is more than -@@ zig with it related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ est Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers think about their destination , mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that which is somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in her K@@ all@@ adian way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native ch@@ lie@@ ger has am@@ using an am@@ using documentary on the site and its famous jumps , to which next to Tr@@ ump also includes the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the king of the heart he did not have it there .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a little Moor@@ ish , &quot; Wen@@ del said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hit the nickname , the k@@ all@@ town in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ as@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to high @-@ German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather with@@ ed and in the US opened a pub for gold dig@@ ger .
cornerstone of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
but the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : your desire to return to the home country , war@@ ded to the Bavarian State , to which the Pf@@ alz belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was ab@@ di@@ ated without permission , had the director of the Institute of pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Folklore , Roland Paul , who explained the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emi@@ grant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this stands at contrast to the mit@@ ap@@ it@@ ant statements of the desc@@ endant .
that had repeatedly talked about Mexican im@@ migrant immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border boundary to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ls , that is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a late relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was sal@@ uted Heinz ) .
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so open . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; this can not be imagined , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cat@@ ered to K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension of Ver@@ oni@@ ka Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz visited something for the church organ , which was generally well introduced .
&quot; this cannot be imagined of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they keep it better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those , who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics as him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter &apos;s Sarah stages .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are mature even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for the Tr@@ ump long interviewed , have seen 12 000 movies , also in the US wo@@ ken up interest .
the Upper Bavarian town Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the local Alpine Club is awarded for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain sti@@ ff village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
there must be at least one fifth of his surface as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , taking over the loss of leadership at the today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ ani@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als but it did not operate any major de@@ port@@ ations with the reviews of today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the ri@@ vals Sun@@ rise , with the Moder@@ ator David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , composed in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this downside of the resistance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise was an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five capitals , in comparison with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase on the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has over the last few months .
in August today , today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ .000 people today .
this is the most interest that has happened every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of packed to the Raf@@ ina Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recent wit@@ ty father , which closes , with its two children down to the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had been asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the white Star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with € 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit a little The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L .
seven had a mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe emerged in an average of 44@@ 6000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump out at 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night the first half hour was achieved by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 viewers and in the second half hour of 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ a of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will immediately feel confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately win at 17 : 30 am .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that managed not to leave the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agreed : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana E@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ know@@ ingly apparently who recognized The Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , eventually landed , was wrapped in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls would certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we are with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana E@@ av@@ y Fel@@ lows on the day before , out of three two , they have possibly acci@@ dentally provided an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in the ly@@ ric way of why wood is the perfect guy and named his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could become their answers about the per@@ ni@@ tion , who won the heart of the Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ as Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both of them - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in store .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with one another from day one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went into the house and were s@@ ams , I felt that they were rather compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ y Fel@@ lows &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands at both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the return visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; the One &quot; could be .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom wood sol@@ ves , if not , there was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving into the U.S. - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his imposing open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some trainers took place Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a sh@@ ini@@ up so as to the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League conver@@ sions at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true colours in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team ex@@ hor@@ ted by the mill he encouraged them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula , Hay@@ ne also strengthened Hay@@ ne on public during his press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Sports @-@ porter In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team @-@ teams Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey who urged him to forget his tre@@ p@@ atz@@ ke catch and look after the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was pat@@ ched at a pun@@ t , restored in the first slot of the Minnesota Vi@@ fa
it was certainly not the start to leave the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian Assembly for its N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne was looking for the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a terrible start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that &apos;s a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne pursu@@ es the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut then in 2007 , as a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall it was a wonderful experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters demand the attitude of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the F@@ W alarm clock in the big flas@@ h@@ sky before a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools ahead of the collision , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will receive ship@@ yards in the Bavarian group . &quot;
the State @-@ survey of the free voters will be vent@@ uring to Friday into the fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
actually , quite other main themes were intended .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ tors meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will be over@@ bearing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clo@@ ister &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked the establishment of UNO protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we have to address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Dog boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want free voters want to shift as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also required more personnel for the judiciary , which is responsible for asylum systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new recru@@ it@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W @-@ chief critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder were not consistent : &quot; we held nationwide consistent standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria travelled , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to act in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state politics in the big wall@@ ab@@ ies shall not fall under the table .
a years of endurance will remain on the order of the day : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us Minister Ludwig Cop@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started in 47 high @-@ level pilot department plus &apos; in which an extension of the g@@ ory school stage of three is tested for four years - in the end it will take nine years to the final .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger does not go far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we call on freedom of campaign for all higher level schools that want to .
free drive at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has come along with a long @-@ wide routes of route @-@ free and annoying trade lines with th@@ read@@ ings .

solid gains also bus@@ hing the trading locations in London and Paris .
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index featured roughly 1 percent in the market in the USA .
many bor@@ ou@@ ans therefore expect the markets up to the interest decision in the US and also the large exp@@ ir@@ ation to get started on this Friday at the place .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens resulting from the nuclear issue has in @-@ meantime cutting @-@ down to a record @-@ track record and also left deep traces in eon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies are showing up to 30 billion euros in retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the numbers named in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately had 3,@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 per cent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by more than 22 percent at D@@ ax gas .
according to a res@@ eller , a positive report from the U.S. soldier &apos;s magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; brought to him from the weekend .
accordingly , investors to the German chip@@ maker currently produces too little attention .
this should be the investment in future @-@ oriented w@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market .
drivers were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August there were again more cars than last year &apos;s period , as the branch association founded A@@ cea at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .

4 people killed , after shooting poli@@ cem@@ an on demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police officers in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution - said an official be@@ amer on Wednesday .
the violence broke off the Tuesday evening in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , premi@@ er district officials , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire @-@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal answered , the police have used Tr@@ ack@@ a and then shot in the air before they resor@@ ted on rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , known by them , although they can kill , but they are traditionally used as less fatal alternative , apparently such a high death rate produced .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as the southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the ma@@ the@@ ques are saying that new provinces come to be made as part of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Nepal among the ethnic group of the Th@@ u , who want their own state .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement that divi@@ des the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 but the legis@@ lature had accelerated the process after the devastating earthqu@@ akes that killed in April thousands of people .
the legis@@ lature had voted this week over certain cl@@ auses in the amendment seeking in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property of the Em@@ of@@ Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re@@ builds .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter surface .
planned is a mixture of trade , commercial and housing - concrete offers are still not available .
Em@@ den - the town of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meter property in direct proximity to the youth centre of Old Post .
the preparations for this are running now .
plans to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commercial and residential .
one should be waiting for such offers , on the part of the city .
which investor would come , be not yet clear .
no contracts were closed .
the city Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Road , already bought a few months ago and can tear the opposite building .
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the plans for the cottage settlement on the small sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented public plans for the project .
several An@@ lie@@ ger are further worried - they fear the selling of their leisure time
months ago was negotiated behind closed doors , wei@@ ghed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now plans for a new holiday house near the small sea near Em@@ den .
Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized em@@ blem of the company &quot; System construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the urban development committee of the Em@@ bro@@ ker .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of proj@@ ec@@ tics and the F@@ DP faction concerned with the investors and administration , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends by the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
it has been on discussion around ten to twelve million euros for months in the discussion .
fierce reactions among sal@@ bu@@ den@@ land@@ owners came into the meeting , prov@@ oked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the landlords and board member in the syndic@@ ate of An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter who over@@ looks the other building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , as several other project members , he fears that the traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; as all Bus@@ lad@@ ders have to come , so that pays off . &quot;
what is exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former guest house , is still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept that Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still fails , the development plans are even variable .

Google launches a dou@@ bling don@@ ating campaign to raise 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling of donations to aid 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations , which is to help thousands of refugees trying to out@@ burst the European nations as they flee from the war and impover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the funds raised on his blog .
instead of letting a manager that make the announcement , Rita S@@ oud , a Google co @-@ employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old and her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey there were many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations have four charitable organisations dedicated to assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google has said that the first global earned funds raised up to $ 5.5 million in the country , to $ 11 million in the country .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ annual civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

over the years , obesity has proved efficiently in treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out in people who are abnormal @-@ in @-@ fat with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers used from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have been collected since 2007 in a study , compare two types of obesity and stomach cancer and stomach @-@ cancer treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes for people who have been slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I was with those who did non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments almost immediately at 29 .
among those who subjected to surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes condition is totally and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , there is only about two percent in comparison with diabetes .
moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors out .
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels by ha@@ em@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values over time .
ha@@ em@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the researcher .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c percentage of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you can see in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decreased the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also found average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group lost more weight than 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger trac@@ ts in BM@@ I ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.0 % ) and consumed rather a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery to five years , there are indications of a study of severe people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who subjected to a adi@@ posit@@ as operation , approximately 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group which deliberately tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring to individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors have to start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes , their bodies have combined with obesity and diabetes is a conversion really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently paying attention in fiction : a young woman , to school@@ hours un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of their youth after years , and this fell in love in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the novel can be interesting above all for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as it takes place in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the cent@@ en@@ ant writer is grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is looking forward to having her home a literary monument .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader prompted to end violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
it demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , like a true peace and genuine development , primarily through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after the 11th September I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence and this has been forth un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ tizer by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years that are swal@@ low @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children getting more and more frequently to these products , and sadly a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink for a cheap experience .
teenagers have said to be dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be instructed by attractive no@@ zzles for the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ ected .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ des , which are very pleasing for children .
hand san@@ i@@ tizer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially in infants can already have a few sy@@ ring@@ es with alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a sip Whis@@ ky , but men leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sp@@ lash of after straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ ant hand san@@ i@@ tizer in school , was taken to the treatment .
her blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is regulated by law by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked her words and was not able to go than she arrived in the up@@ take .
they monitored overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through alcohol and saw the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has encouraged parents and teachers to utilize non @-@ alcoholic foods or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
on alcohol abuse , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were related to death cases .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died in Ontario &apos;s women , which contained a toxic , not declared ingredient .
health authorities pres@@ cribes that the product of meth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ anol co@@ hol , who has been noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , &quot; po@@ is@@ oned their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; this is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police considered the failed plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and the trans@@ disciplinary action to the school authorities .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three cars damaged

there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was sh@@ red@@ ded spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team @-@ mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of a front contest in Scottish football lo@@ af Coun@@ tries - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National @-@ player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador to Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no points of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people not only talk about the return of the ranking .
you talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars D@@ ei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny D@@ ei@@ la accepts that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chief si@@ ll to rot@@ ate things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now down at the top of the table with five point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sorry about what happens .
we feel this exactly as we must go on .
we really need the support provided by Celtic because that makes the player better .
to stand up now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton mechanical on January @-@ transfers
despite his comments ahead of only a few weeks ago that he indicated a few January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful when signing new arri@@ vals and ins@@ ists that he does not want to dis@@ rupt the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have these pre @-@ season to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is served by adding extra players to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising overall in the UK .
in May until July unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate amoun@@ ted to 5.@@ 9 percent over the progression of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( ons ) showed .
in the meantime , employment fell into Scotland by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ i commented the most recent figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is being put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the Death Strip in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard glos@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was opened in January for the first time in January , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day moved closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should see instructions in the USA , and as many more applicants are available , find a flaw@@ less lottery , to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media centers from 12 to five .
who is chosen will em@@ see it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ ough friend where I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to remember all the details .
a journalist in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ying with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it adm@@ its that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks she &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had an issue with some of the things I told and written .
he does not tell me what to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter was present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I made .
I will not go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his acts according to the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Her@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you might turn to .
what you will get from me is what it says to let a man die without unnecessary death .
man according to the hum@@ id police @-@ hunt , persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards continued to sp@@ y it and re@@ com@@ end the racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by racing Victoria tried to re@@ install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he led to the ste@@ wards and the integration division of racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing and he did not find himself under difficult circumstances , when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ a probe in Li@@ dar@@ i that he cannot explain .
he had taken back for the age of 18 months because of es@@ pi@@ onage training , and did not want it to &quot; see &quot; as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this and I have been eating out for a long time , but sometimes you feel so frustrated that everything comes up at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it is wi@@ ther .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it , which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well this evening .
I &apos;d like to s@@ nat@@ ched by the protagon@@ ist , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I then have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had voiced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , making the co @-@ operation department had tried to sp@@ y its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will say if I ask - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
apparently they clearly believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should believe on their n@@ oses , because they have failed to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , married . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should my opinion be that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L celebrate its cow@@ or@@ kers and do perhaps people outside of coaches in charge of what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they must take my license and shut me off , and I have no doubt that what I say will think about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ar @-@ level of coach have been building with the long @-@ expanding cob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i and that L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led him that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license across the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , the best known by its preparation of the un@@ polished master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race was &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse deb@@ tor , which was b@@ lown against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has ir@@ ably cleared up the leg on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day as it was like this .
but there was also like this on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification forecast for treatment with the pack at the race day . an inquiry into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people establish these rules , they know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy fails to fight against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ amy gam@@ bler of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers start the Storm players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition veteran &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victories in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett really made a hard case to the Storm Team after his team had achieved the Final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its team and said that she is in the Tac@@ tics only on their &quot; contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach in his team makes him confident because it was be@@ wil@@ dered , that they worry , beaten off by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions when they hit us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have nothing changed to our defensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have provided our contact with Tac@@ cles as a real focus and that gave us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit shock for him .
it is funny , as this is always happening again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy awarded Ben@@ nett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett from St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he compared his evening on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was critic@@ ised as a dull team in 2010 and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we are looking for exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , making them play as they play .
I build confidence stronger because they say these things because they are a bit worried , against us to play .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us than the big games went .
Bell@@ amy spread out that the game Storm at Roo@@ ster had achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and there are not a point of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the rules .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them .
the Storm team is free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from next year tomorrow .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drug cl@@ ad
a man who threatened with possibly a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his experiment , into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mug@@ gled to Queensland were released against a deposit of $ 200,000 each .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the police force got 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly viable penalty for attempting to possess a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been from an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter R@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated to the court on Wednesday .
during the pen@@ al , he occupied the police about his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had requested a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the dis@@ son@@ ic explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the running of a 200,000 of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge f@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being warned , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , mar@@ ched on the police daily and at which he was at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

for a check @-@ end with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been badly injured on the Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in the direction of a permanent position in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it too late and was in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left as the police dealt .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le typ@@ ed the phone of a 11 year old girl to ask images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g accepted the phone of the girl , when this slept , log@@ ger himself into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing reports and alar@@ ming immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web research concerned , which used the terms for search of un@@ affiliated images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g then declared against the officials he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he announced that seeking on the computer were carried out by him , however , it may be done because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to be scared to frigh@@ ten themselves .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he is sick in his head , if he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
it then looked at the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confron@@ t@@ ted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station took advantage of talking to girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , who found guilty as guilty of the bill of indictment un@@ related images of children on June 25th of the year , signed up on 25 January this year against the dict@@ ates and not to be issued prior to trial hearing on 24 March of that year .
defence coun@@ sel Greg@@ ory for the reason that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual perpetrators , since one could argue that &quot; no other sexual element &quot; may be found in his accident .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael res@@ umes the verdi@@ ct until October , to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted this case , but was held in custody for au@@ ditions to other still available cases .
he was added yet before the date of the judgement into the register of sexual perpetrators .
hau@@ st soft limits to small border @-@ transi@@ tions to Germany
more and more refugees are taken out at the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ user were allowed out of fear of discovery and capture the people multip@@ ly in smaller fron@@ tier @-@ out@@ puts
on the Austrian side out , he said a spokes@@ man of the police force .
along the border @-@ river Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been picked up over 1,000 refugees on Tuesday .
you went to the German side by foot over bridges and dam .
there they will be transferred from federal govern@@ ors in reception and forwar@@ ded to the registration .
at Munich &apos;s main train station , the German police officers came again with more refugees during the course of the week on Wednesday .
until 8 : 00 p.m. , some 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls placed at the German @-@ Austrian border , the town was reached on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : runner from Tro@@ pics tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the South @-@ West expected
met@@ eor@@ ologists warn against assault rif@@ les in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a deep @-@ pressure area on Western Europe rivers , warm sea air currently shares warm air into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
the vigor@@ ous Deep State is the urs@@ ors of the tropical stur@@ ms &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn across the Atlantic over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands .
fierce storms and storms are expected above all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday , too early also in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ oni@@ ans Al@@ b and at the sea @-@ sea at Bo@@ en from 60 to 90 timetable is expected .
the sun therefore leaves to be back longer with the sun .
the mass does it : every two years the motor@@ maker at the IA@@ A show her novel@@ ties .
2015 is to be found mainly on the comp@@ atri@@ ots , which are currently particularly well sale .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : about 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new interpre@@ tations , the Federal Office ( KBA ) increased in August alone in August .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( audience days 17 through September 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new models are presented in this year .
one of the largest premium for the German auto industry is Opel A@@ stra , which will be available in the autumn by the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
so that the volume of the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra is not much more expensive .
Opel set up an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf in View , which starts at 5@@ 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs about 16 9@@ 90 Euros .
we have the A@@ stra with a new 1.4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
in addition , the Hessen further diesel and gasoline engines offer 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra has just as five @-@ fifth .
the second variation will follow the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will be used next to A@@ stra A@@ stra for new comp@@ actors ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e Renault Send the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only one @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emphasized sports GT version .
in trade it comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ firm wants to locate its position in the very growing segment with the new model .
the compact , Infin@@ iti fits its curved lines fully into the brand &apos;s design line .
the base model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 @-@ l@@ iter @-@ tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or , with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer information at 170 new@@ ton meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but rev@@ oked the compact model DS 4 , which is seen at the IA@@ A .
in the outside the designer of the fine Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n drainage cast above all hand in front of the front@@ section : the cooling fan is drawn , as well as the changed search@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons are reduced by a touch@@ screen and Apple &apos;s Apple Play is integrated .
in addition , the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I refer to the comp@@ actor class as well as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are deserted
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht is explicitly given an ex @-@ prisoner of the ali@@ dom@@ ed arm@@ chair , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violations of human dignity , in@@ mates are generally eligible for financial compensation when they are located in small cells .
it confirmed the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can judge the judges , according to their money , even if they were locked away only a few days in the close rooms ( AZ . 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe was successful : he was placed in the alignment of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell , with approximately five square meters of ground floor ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now once more on the free foot , had been laid in a larger cell .
his conception of the office because of the un@@ worthy ad@@ hesion reference to the land Berlin was wholly deliber@@ ated .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge over@@ took the judgment of the Chamber of Chamber in Berlin and gave the case to renewed examination .
you see the man &apos;s man hurt .
chamber decision now decides over the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the fragile period only a few days of liability for the compensation are decisive , whether it was an equ@@ ate statement , it says .
otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a black@@ ish protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber should now clear the amount of damage in the region .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they spoke to a prisoner of damage only in April because he was completely locked in a cell in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , that an in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 had reached an in@@ decent accommodation .
the then K@@ lä@@ ger was accommodated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons have also arrived in the headlines in the past weeks due to lack of light .
prisoners are therefore included , again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rise , even to bat , it should have been so because of the tense situation .
according to information from the Liber@@ al press@@ way , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior men ; 19 is to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is to be found in Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seekers are following Germany from the Federal Department of Labour in this year , according to the statement of vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create this and we are creating that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Bundes@@ ministeriums ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) each year - according to the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built before ( 25@@ 0@@ 000 apartments ) .
the absence of housing , however , is mostly at affordable properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments drop out of lease , and in order to apply these especially favorable apartments also to refugees .
the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) is why to double the funding , at the time 518 million is up to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the Pen@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to occur and for this , the federal government should have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agree that scientists and the federal government believe that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the housing structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Institute for labour market research and professional research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be po@@ ised in the long run .
however , in Germany the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification in order to help them start with , critic@@ ised by Claudia Walter , project managers for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is vital whether they find a job in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the grants , says migrant researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt there has been a political shift : from the work provided to refugees to recognise work .
while it used to place an working ban for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the Residen@@ ze , the asylum seekers .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - have prevailed the viewpoint that refugees should be enabled faster access to the labour market .
a large obstacle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no out@@ cry of universal appeal in general and public @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs most often get conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt the royal road towards the worker integration .
the Berlin school @-@ government established that there were few escaped parents to give their children to the kit@@ eline , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oting parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ack@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in various languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase strong by large numbers of refugees would try the Berlin Senate to increase the capacities of capacities - for example , bringing more technical schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared without German knowledge of the teaching classes .
however , they are not always teaching of fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ eps from the Berlin Department of Berlin .
the German Studenten@@ werk is that it is estimated that some 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or De@@ tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior , Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has then abandoned its position .
studying refugees could be facilitated by access to the university .
because refugees with such ad@@ minister@@ ial or d@@ ul@@ ting do not receive any performance by asylum seekers , when they start studying .
they usually get no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ e@@ gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
the refugees had so far spent four years in Germany to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible for so far , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this funding gap must be closed but Steff@@ en Oc@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
you should get the students immediately ( BA@@ Fö@@ G ) .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should continue to establish the same rights of Islam , as they have the churches , and the existing state churches have continued to develop into a new state of religion .
it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association which deals with the new arri@@ vals .
among the rights they also belong to duties .
thus , representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts , and to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
it is also part of a readiness to face religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Board of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday the worry , religious conflicts may also be drawn to Germany .
those who want to stra@@ y these conflicts in Germany have immediately their right , here in Germany , &quot; he said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Broadcasting Corporation .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is also more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has , as a result of European decisions , has been a pro @-@ discrimination system since a decade and a system of equality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and the authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist subject .
equal odds for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders have long been asking for long @-@ term international agreements , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ is@@ mus@@ ons Convention , must be a reality over the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is able to provide medical emergency medical care so far , the doctor President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ power is concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must therefore be flowing into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all arri@@ vals are equal to the registration of health cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the services could later be rep@@ uted with the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and on the long @-@ term , it is highly question@@ able so many people have to di@@ gest with the restricted service catalogue that the asylum application law pres@@ umes .
otherwise , doctors have to create the language barriers in particular .
already so far , the Berlin science @-@ scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been evi@@ den@@ ced , migrants are more educated about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical procedures would have to be taken into interpreter , she demands .
in the emergency treatment , many refugees would have been helped in emergency treatment .
and with a different diagnostic view .
under the refugee crisis , approximately there are much more untreated disability , and in the young people it is about HIV .
with the partial other disease pictures , German doctors and their training come from their training , &quot; Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis is not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what affects the anno@@ y@@ ness is by the refugees possibly even mi@@ ving in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a high @-@ developed education system , several refugees were even doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to practice it , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and offer tests again perhaps again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are dise@@ ased by psych@@ ologically ill neg@@ atively : most are suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable is the refugee camp , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent published study of the TU Munich is assuming that every five Syrian refugee &apos;s refugee has been traumati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , among other things , it suffers the so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with air@@ pressure , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart r@@ attle and death @-@ relie@@ ves .
further symptoms are dormit@@ ory and concentration disorders , strong ver@@ acity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent that the symptoms are chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
up to now , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
while mentally , mentally , asylum seekers can submit a request for Psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social welfare states , most of the circumstances or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this frequently leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new staging of &quot; passion &quot; the Cir@@ cus brings us back to the traditions of Cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age bracket to the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus runs into the ring on the brick on the brick of w@@ n@@ oses to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ le , and Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current management staging .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family .
so the gift to delight in the family is therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people of their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year old j@@ uni@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ ws with a cosmopolitan city , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst its concept .
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tours are now able to enjoy this lifestyle .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces by talented artists from all over the world .
distinguished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown took the audience with wit and charm in their spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their crafts@@ manship .
with the heroes of the mur@@ ders it will contain the Cub@@ an duo .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics how little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
abnorm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often topics of different animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks on the position : &quot; it is not good to our animals , it also doesn &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying each stroke unit .
the &quot; four@@ leg@@ ed arti@@ stes &quot; as they are affection@@ ately called , after possibility of every desire of the eyes read off .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the ring .
so , the first commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land @-@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud .
the two animals have lived eight years in a c@@ ages and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there is something for every visitor to be involved .
&quot; one thing is sure , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 participants , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock , the rates are reduced .
furthermore , the wel@@ far@@ away is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .

Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread out about social media .
the opening of the parliament was also comfor@@ ted by the members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death on the death and they had warned that they were warned that Mr Mu@@ gabe leads to Mr Mu@@ gabe .
in the past month , they had booked it hidden and interrupted for him during his speech at the State of the State ; this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven @-@ positions by SMS messages have received on their phones , which they warned to dis@@ rupt the Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; this message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe .
it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity of the Parliament ends and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ person said that of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i @-@ guided party is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will store up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 jobs in terms of restruc@@ tur@@ ings and cost @-@ saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will then split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and press business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected acquisition structure leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , who shall lead the unity of separation .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is going to be smaller and more focused than it has today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .

it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , where it was called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley .
HP has passed a massive restructuring to cope with the coming from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this area , based on the conviction that strongly focused companies will perform better performance .
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mi@@ cle Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates at the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emph@@ atic attention to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation according to the plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly feature the next four games for England and in the face of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had pushed the final season after a separate bone injury , and then returned to its old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well heated .
this is not a bigger issue .
this was just an accident .
there was not in connection with his knees or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from the purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there are the related danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the midst of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ al of arsen@@ als of 157 league play in the last five seasons .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 in one of the two Premier League clubs which have noticed most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of the Teu@@ fel@@ ice sheet , but Arsenal believes that improvement in the viol@@ ability rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a short time period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his champi@@ ons League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger constitutes a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , what does Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Re@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break @-@ off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest intimi@@ dation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also beaten to 41 games after the &quot; un@@ conqu@@ erable &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereby on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains ready from distant hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ocr@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out in arsen@@ al .
we were in 2006 very close to this , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is evident , especially with regard to how the need for males to open themselves , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , as suici@@ de advice may prove to be demonstrated in young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of deaths among men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more prevalent in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ é@@ ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 , as the year of the man , aiming to ask the culture , the men prevent it to seek help if they need these .
friendship is the heart of struggle for coping with this challenge .
a current study at over 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms demonstrated that if the suff@@ erer , had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery has doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course one also needs to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media @-@ run communications with their focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lifestyle have the need to appear strongly , life @-@ fun and successfully to appear , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health a lot more profound .
and as a video game ( invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently told , money cannot really buy them .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus on the head has been placed .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which is excell@@ ed by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can refer back to each case even though they often fall back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone calls I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening to people who feel depres@@ sed and are confident , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term wages .
this clearly shows the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone to look at men in moments of desper@@ ation may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you can see somebody alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say Hi .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent on Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria is meeting to help P@@ SG to break@@ up Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Mozart son Cav@@ ani following his hits on Malmö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps P@@ SG to get to the Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Mozart son Cav@@ ani continued course as the Paris Saint @-@ Germain earned his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a P@@ SG @-@ player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities , before they finally reached a head start , as Cav@@ al@@ in at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k as well as in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they seek not only the qualification of the N.@@ C.@@ D rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no paper of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunity before the gate . he became later in the game against his home team and against the club , with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and relaxed , even though there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said blan@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was decided on the weekend of a 2 : 2 un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but was carried out in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine whis@@ k was referred to as the man who has been the P@@ SG to the next step in Europe , and he interpreted in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted why , when he entered the Malmö g@@ ai@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before he joined Johan Wil@@ and passes nicely into the long corner of the network .
if someone believed that P@@ SG would have a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , which nominated in an instant @-@ off to reach this level , joined with An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national protagon@@ ists on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides the shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who is far ahead of Kevin Tr@@ ash P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , P@@ SG even encountered along with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was placed in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had placed him after the restart .
nevertheless he did much more skill than he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria was transformed into a process resulting from Wil@@ der in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved its sixth year of victory after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö can return to the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to last David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before sub@@ stitution Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi provide a gate at the end .
the coaches of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that P@@ SG played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the Quali@@ fication games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat ab in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi takes place since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times of Spanish champion , three times Po@@ cal@@ orie , four times Champions League Champion , two times champion of the world champion , two times the champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca reveals X@@ avi now that he was already standing before the departure from Barcelona before the departure of Barcelona .
&quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid was at that time everything , we did nothing , &quot; he tells .
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ sman took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t switched
but the change did not come into existence .
and the differenti@@ ating man for this is working today for the German record manager : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken an agreement to Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; by this he has taken me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s game time 2008 / 2009 had been running with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League for the whole distance on the lawn , and switched the reds from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the king classes triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in movie
Matt Dam@@ on made the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ broke the experienced actor Brown as they emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , we do it during the cast of the film and not during the cast of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tering .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the production @-@ colle@@ gi@@ ers Ben aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as you treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person and she is a sp@@ ut@@ te that is defeated by her white balance .
the producer of De@@ ar White People set off for the fin@@ alists Leo fishing and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for Director rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; by the end could give us something we didn &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the soci@@ alistic media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip by wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s the KNO@@ WING that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et co@@ iled more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on comments are at a time when accurate racial representation in the media are at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ cem@@ an , the Movement of Black lives achieved a nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against in @-@ colour .
in February the vo@@ cal@@ ist Prince himself made a cont@@ ent@@ ment to the movement during the introduction of the released albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more time leaders have released a statement in recent times as response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group was treated as a hatred group .
&quot; the network black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the guides .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media outlets , who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&quot; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; Con@@ tin@@ t First Champion
professional clim@@ bers and operator help Isaac cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million home .
the contest show , which just finished off their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participants , who managed to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , till the Fin@@ als .
at the last task the climbing was over a 75 foot long climbing @-@ rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had the job within the time , with which he finished the first athlete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero greeted his challenge in three seconds quicker , which made it the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to us ! News for the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock about winning the great prize of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his hor@@ des of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as of a sudden as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ters to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he was first at all to win the course , not least your prize money .
in accordance with the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there are more than one fin@@ alists , it only gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and changed your life , it receives the great gra@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he described anything like that .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
masses of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad he is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same way , if they were sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a second season , the shooting will begin in Spring 2016 .
Detroit &apos;s s@@ ander on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in earlier they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last seat in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , played this part on Tuesday perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance for Ascension in a play area of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F that was hard to grasp about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ ch Alfredo Simon held up his early offensive support to sustain as Detroit three times in the first two an@@ ings then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the Bull@@ pes each game , and therefore I want to go into the game entirely .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two rows , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Nav@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has s@@ led the brass well , &quot; said hop@@ mus .
he looked good at the ( percussion training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ ring , and he caused it straight into the play .
with three R@@ uns in the back @-@ up at the end of the seventh month , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Brain Hi@@ cks got a Bun@@ t , and Simon got his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian for Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano who made a two @-@ run indign@@ ation to the right @-@ handed flat@@ ness .
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ab@@ ha@@ ge brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe in a double Play .
it was the major league leading 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ les proposed double play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth @-@ end , the wall of a R@@ BI double won against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the Ri@@ om@@ anders , however , S@@ ano is at three pitch for its fifth year .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the opening of the game from an even non @-@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three ro@@ uns in the first two an@@ ings against the Right @-@ handed veteran , who was rep@@ ain@@ ted prior to the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after he was missing for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning which I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I left releasing and felt that I would create some rather good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ha@@ v gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .

Ischgl : German military measures in Syria
the director of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , presents military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s thinking about military options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago it was very pleased that the Kel@@ ch had gone by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict landed in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in German . &quot; &quot; &quot;

also Germany have returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; explained them .
referring to the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have already announced conversations between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives from Germany .
concrete figures still called them and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the last few days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ er route from Hungary to Austria .
your destination is usually Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann received a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet to agree on joint action in the crisis so far .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting to take up a new cycle to the mandatory distribution of more 120 000 refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the strong refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bund will gather this together with the countries , Merkel announced the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the law office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lining two people , the protection , complaint these too .
who has no perspective , could not stay in Germany either .
this view was shared in the round em@@ bank@@ ment .

there were first ar@@ rests of people who had called the fence .

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to take care of his lean line will often fall rather down from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - above all Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits still : in them stick B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos are taking a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
who eats the fruits , thus supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune systems and metabolic processes in the body .
in purchasing , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and sm@@ elling .
the shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very delicious .
they should camp at room temperature and be consumed in less days .
then you taste of course pure or in sweet food .

it has mild to some bitter taste of foli@@ age sal@@ ads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

after the Thursday morning on Thursday morning we crossed a distinctive li@@ cking @-@ front , the vigor@@ ous rainf@@ alls , wind bows and a temperature r@@ ens .

Rome is now an Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s place
under 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s place .
in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio San , on Wednesday a far @-@ known square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tised to the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could live over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith .
with the Square I would become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to the turn of the annual turn@@ around 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city back then as a scap@@ e@@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions could further strengthened him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then begun with his theses against the Ab@@ b@@ sh@@ an@@ del , the spl@@ itting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer &apos;s artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ crown is one of the main works that has painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail wrote the introduction and posted scriptures .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now been released with gorgeous images .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his quite personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , according to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
founded around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that are devoted to topics such as cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , commandments , or father@@ land .
this makes him personally fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who had focused on the foundation of painting with the scriptures .
he interpreted the Bible &apos; by Ot@@ mar Alt &apos; and thus translated into the present context .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled they are embedded between the original study of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who have formulated his quite personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old opens twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode was born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant denom@@ ination .
&quot; since the education had happened already with the pipe , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to do that , maybe to keep me back with the Lord father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to put forward the art again in a fast @-@ depth time : &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ten is shaped by a complaint , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness ; to point things .
pictures have always something mystical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ator go &quot; into the images , &quot; let them work and feel what power they have : &quot; the image looks for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail exp@@ elled on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos; , which has always been a lover of Oth@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like being comprehen@@ ded with his paintings . &quot;
old I don &apos;t care to grasp the Bible completely , but that is selected for him important , even mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the pictures that explains the text merely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deepen his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start @-@ up for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , businesses commissioned to have been model@@ ed for a round @-@ course : one year later almost everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finally finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration , intended for failure , above all with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for planning permission .
the approval will come in October , I could inform the First church council Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year has never happened again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; other commemor@@ ative break &quot; with the work of the former warehouse .
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from up to 2019 , the Bundesliga continues on the weekend to be a clear sign .
the football is responding to the mounting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle that I am not doing anything , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested to get a handle on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B &apos;s CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s post next Wednesday and he held the state of affairs in Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ha@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a key role to play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive step now has to place politics .
the German Bundesliga team therefore has extended its refugee initiative . &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which has been extended for four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues by 2019 , &quot; says Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal ists support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine is a clear sign when they take place on the left trig@@ gers instead of the usual standard sponsorship ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ boss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Image &quot; magazine ( Tuesday ) , and described the project as a &quot; natural course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re able to play football ( football , no , we must use our sentences , our influence and our possibilities in order to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ ded Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary in this Friday the national team of women offers 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties in their places would have their own projects , be magnificent .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we have spent will live in football .
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government are providing 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called all the sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP vor@@ ad@@ sor@@ f will lose an eye for the accident
the prime minister of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye in several reports , according to a fall in early July .
with the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , that he carried a hand in his left hand , the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is nearly ble@@ ed , was oh@@ n@@ ly , has then moved out tow@@ ed to the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ i &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ arri@@ vel@@ ier .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could however follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet before the supervis@@ ory board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said flat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old manager will be with the meeting and &quot; busy work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; on Thursday , who will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software concert .
&quot; I am full of SAP here , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German company headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to something such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again when you please . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...

football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia &apos;s view all hopes were final for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of Europe &apos;s league .
the national player is also missing the championship leader of the football Bundesliga as well as in Du@@ eling with the FK Cr@@ as@@ no@@ dar at Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Ge@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against le@@ verk@@ usen , let the BV@@ B @-@ Coach open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will change his anc@@ e. not only at the Re@@ us location .
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking a seat from the art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on a absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in the future in all Europe League games , but made jo@@ ck@@ le open .
in a high probability , he will also challenge the second parti@@ tions .
the for@@ ested statement by Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the Fin@@ als suit for the BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal , holds central area Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; thus Marco is not as wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grasp the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roboter@@ use : the government wants a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner after the will of the federal government in the transformation of the car of technological solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategic paper from the house of traffic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides for example investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the br@@ ink of the fair IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated , connected driving will increase road safety and provide less st@@ acking , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states which at IA@@ A also meet with representatives of industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Culture emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band super@@ structure and to increase awareness on digital radio coverage .
there is currently a test track for testing new technology on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany wants to use approximately internationally for the permitted maximum speed of self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government also wants to apply to a change of the Vienna Convention so far that only man sees the driver as a driver .
at automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study carried by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD ( German chan@@ ger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of personal data of the driver must be clear but clear .
but on the other hand , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - a lot more than French or American .
a survey on the AA survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ators DE@@ K@@ RA is expected that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be enforced in the coming decade , 32 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents opposed to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to leave completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital de@@ formity , only seven percent would agree to pass the control over all roads throughout the entire drive .
on the highway , the flowing traffic could at least 15 percent be able to imagine , at the St@@ au 45 percent .

Gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a mixture of very great fashion show and a wat@@ cht@@ on Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that thanks to video proj@@ ections terri@@ fying human .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as , has been the great star of fashion scene - and therefore that he put men in bl@@ acks .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; before , it was very easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pper changed his prior to a show on his / her personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit out of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made it in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the little &apos;s work of the man , the fashion story , without ever having to get an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not buil@@ du@@ p but it is an excellent chore@@ ographer total work , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material have m@@ amed the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich according to Munich .

he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Te@@ ddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ zed fashion foot@@ steps of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he was attracted to his Te@@ ddy Be@@ HS and clothes , she said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
a cell of fashion also made a connection to himself later .
he has fashion papers and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told .
but I bought this course again .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the mod@@ els .
they got nothing but the gear could be kept .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ ching - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
it used to go to the long nit@@ rate machines in and around Pl@@ aces to climb up a meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and peaks have emerged as a great deal for customers , which for example worked with blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ale , Pl@@ aces .
instead the fashion is again important .
during the initial days of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® , Fashion plays a major role , was then replaced by the textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as hand@@ bags and regional costumes .
anyway , the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode , which ren@@ oun@@ ces itself in the past sti@@ le , a growing order potential .
those who are not serving in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make the half of all orders .
Mo@@ ale &apos;s flas@@ hes , together with nine other companies , is member of the branch association of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may register the protected label .
in the last 15 years some 80 percent of the sales are broken away .
private dealers and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach the customer on this path .
nowadays , the mass goods are manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
weak@@ ened of export , currently according to Russia and to the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to realize through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen compound in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we are organic and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; that is also true of the materials used . &quot;
diploma vice president U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger nearby School of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied art - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to keep an eye out of the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies which above all need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design often gets slightly varies in order to hold a customer base .

&quot; many people in the region are identified with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies them in the USA , from Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ y@@ ments and surroundings and would like to mem@@ ori@@ ze a mem@@ ento .

Disney is planning new &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos; -@@ Film

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy for the world wider
the economy must open itself wider and open to growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central command group for deepening a comprehensive reform .
encourage new start @-@ ups and deliver reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity @-@ list for regulating the marking , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of government agencies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l up of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and corporations are not identified if investments do not enter into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance because it as@@ signs to the market a larger role in the ingredient of resources , a legally state business environment and open the market more open , &quot; said the Statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also temp@@ t controls of powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to run their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors open , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will deliver the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; , while the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury bor@@ hood in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ory fish and consumers to impose a significantly higher dose of nerve fir@@ ing .
consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is a suitable work@@ book of the EU critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full weight to pregnant and small children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t by Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t said that the threshold values of nerve @-@ poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; must be withdrawn from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury subject of kilograms .
big predat@@ ory Fish be so strongly contaminated with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the existing threshold values about 50 per cent of the bas@@ ins are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the bor@@ der@@ ings then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be negoti@@ able .
in turn , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the threshold values with other fish@@ ings of currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram Mercury per kilo@@ gram .
Food@@ watch has recorded this however as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ eter@@ ies , such as car@@ p is usually so low bur@@ dened so that they are already adher@@ ed to the planned maximum levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of the cl@@ erg@@ ism is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action @-@ maneu@@ ver , which helps only the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a man , which is highly toxic to man about the food chain , particularly acute in the food chain .
the German government warns us that &quot; already small quantities can cause particularly un@@ ear@@ ns of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry is on his homepage with regard to the applicable high@@ s but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is primarily driven by the coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written request from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired armament Ba@@ er@@ bock came more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year comprising two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish about the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and universal , &quot; in March the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted out of the paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from Mercury in fish have already been to the most common reported health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
