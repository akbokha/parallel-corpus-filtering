deal with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat meat
I urge me to take the negotiations between our two delegations for the import of Ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for Ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the shaft and the export of Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ bs after the world market and particularly after the community is not affected by the New Zealand - and lam@@ b meat on these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cool@@ ed Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
following this agreement , New Zealand for Ham@@ mel , lam@@ b - and Go@@ als and Go@@ als of access to the Community of the Community within the agreement is ensured .
in New Zealand , the assurance that the normal paragraph of his ham@@ mel - and paraly@@ sis is not affected by the application of the regulation in co @-@ passion .
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure by suitable procedures that the year @-@ quantity does not transc@@ end the set quantity .
the set @-@ up quantities are executed in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from continuing to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the Community market .
should a change in the supply form be made possible by changes in technology and in trading , the two contractual parties should consult each other before introducing such a change in the 10 referred to in clause 10 to find appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes the protection clause , it is obliged to protect themselves from this Agreement for the New Zealand interests .
in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to exp@@ el the imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports from this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
the joining of new Member States changes the Community in consultation with New Zealand , in clause 2 fixed volumes according to the scope of the New Zealand trade with every new Member State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry fee for these new Member States shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this context , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ech@@ st &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if a Re@@ agen@@ z is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena cannot occur : a ) ugly properties ;
the Tit@@ ans is measured via a renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent on the double in a suitable medium .
the Tit@@ ans is the rec@@ ti@@ tious value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object @-@ bearer .
the World Health Organization has established for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to the blood group of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , are prepared for time norms .
according to definition a Internation@@ ales standard gro@@ at contains according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual grants of red blood cells ( 1 ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in the fli@@ ck@@ ery form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory activity of the drug .
the expiry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the gri@@ asi@@ bility tests ; it is approved by the state super@@ visory authorities .
drying agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ised gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container , in which they are dried up and which is closed so that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at the most of 0,5 b.@@ H. of his weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
for the prevention of bacterial growth , the competent authority can determine that Re@@ agen@@ z ( or the agents supplied with the dry re@@ agents supplied ) , provided an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic used , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to have the conditions attached to specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ agents , equally valid , whether in the fli@@ ck@@ ery shape or after the re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain any sedi@@ mentation or any visible particles .
the re@@ agents required for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents to the blood group determination should not be colored artificial as long as not until an international agreement had come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents to the blood group determination are distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that in a container transfer Re@@ agen@@ z is not only enough to carry out tests using the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount in a container @-@ readable amount must be so great that the content may be used to carry out the action described in this record .
the manufacturer &apos;s labor@@ atory has on all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to achieve blood @-@ determination written records .
adequate rehear@@ sals of all re@@ agents have been kept so long from the laboratory to preserve , until with some lik@@ eli@@ hood can be assumed that the Char@@ ge will no longer be used .
the re@@ agents used by re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided by the source of their effective proportion into three groups .
that does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain solely substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are not contained in any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black available in white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
