the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Law ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained how the research committee has been judged to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package fee ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt ( tablets that apply in the mouth ) , as a solution to dispos@@ able ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ es thought and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ bi @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological disease , in which the patients manage many periods ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ tune ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe severe severe severe severe episodes and in the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the medicine .
the inj@@ ecting solution is used for rapid control of gest@@ ant anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases the solution can be used or the mel@@ ting in patients may be applied in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties are prepared .
in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemicals that enable communication of neur@@ ons to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol probably appears above all as a &quot; partial ag@@ onists &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is working to activate the recept@@ ors .
da Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tus in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ le contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms , and their re@@ inv@@ itations will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the re@@ emergence of the symptoms , was investigated in three studies over by one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting redemption has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which are compared to a mental anxiety , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent the re@@ venge to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study on 3@@ 01 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led to gest@@ ured un@@ rest , using the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ on ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
for all studies the change in symptoms experienced by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients examined for treatment .
the company also led out studies in analy@@ sing how the body det@@ ects the mel@@ ting tables and the solution to inv@@ itations ( adop@@ ts ) .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting resolution showed patients , the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of pl@@ agu@@ ed trouble than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
when applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy turned up to 74 weeks in more effective than plac@@ ebo in@@ denti@@ al episodes in previously treated patients and if it was also administered into an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of pl@@ agu@@ ed anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ y@@ ram@@ id@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controll@@ ably ) , weak@@ ening , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , shelter , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , shelter , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ ed@@ ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Resour@@ ce Technology ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from severe to severe man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the many episodes in dealing with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol spoke to predomin@@ ate the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the outcome , that the advantages of inj@@ ecting solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in case of bias @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance if a oral therapy is not suited to outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bias @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ vou@@ ac disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ du@@ tor is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the start or change an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treating Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder has no elevated su@@ icide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol should pre@@ disp@@ ose of patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac ar@@ rests , cardi@@ ac disease , disorders that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with bloody drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol fr@@ amed Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ i@@ i@@ esis .
if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ le@@ y@@ sk@@ in@@ i@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or in@@ clear high fever , without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ulture in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are linked with var@@ ic@@ ils .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol in patients with psych@@ osis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , a heigh@@ tened mortality compared to the plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with Fi@@ x@@ er Dos@@ age , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contacting of unwanted run@@ t@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ al events with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , has been reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk estimates for Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related inci@@ dents in with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs to be treated patients , the direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored on a regular basis regarding wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie because of using anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect and could lead to severe complications and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines will be taken with over@@ ag@@ eing side effects such as Se@@ dierung ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist of Fam@@ o@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ p@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , however this effect is not as clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy regul@@ ators , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reductions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos;@@ bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result in common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
when you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ect inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose @-@ reductions .
after de@@ formation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dosage ranges from the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ am concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ wn pra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patient should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ae .
due to insufficient data base for safety while men and due to the concerns caused by the animal studies in pregnancy , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible use jus@@ ti@@ fies clear the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including vehicles , to use until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential health @-@ related effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ovo , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ i@@ des , compared with patients who were treated with semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol were treated , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under the loss therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ a@@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment .
in the long term recovery period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ age treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol and plac@@ ebo in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enhancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
regarding the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ i@@ esis and var@@ ic@@ u@@ alties , unwanted wounded events and increased mortality with older dementia patients , Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the launch were un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a her@@ b@@ ati@@ zation in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol ; it is unlikely , however , that ha@@ vo@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , as Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ le has a high plastic map@@ le .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ h@@ i @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial ag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ ors and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to H@@ ist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Receiver .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial was presented in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ sive patients who held a response to study medicine , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study points , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a l@@ ackl@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of minimum 5 kg at an average weight of approx . 6,@@ 6 kg ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible d@@ osing about 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ bi @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with Fi@@ x@@ er dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ bi @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol compared to plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol showed a compared to plac@@ ebo in@@ vari@@ ably effectiveness in week 3 and a reduction effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium or semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with the symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie on like li@@ thium or semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks do not match to li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ le a superior effectiveness at reducing problems compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in the treatment phase , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol showed a re@@ mission to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ ing , predominantly in the prevention of a revers@@ al attack in the Man@@ ie .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy@@ modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ization is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol with exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximate 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , there are no differences in the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ tic investigation of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a @-@ specific evaluation for Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals y@@ iel@@ ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin , or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ae .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy pro@@ ban@@ den .
a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with a different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmaceuticals function of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zol , but the study embr@@ aced only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabo@@ lic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety v@@ ology , toxicity in repeat@@ ability , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ari@@ icity , Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data left no special dangers to humans .
To@@ xi@@ ological signific@@ ative effects have only been observed in doses or expos@@ ing , which significantly exceeds the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only limited for the clinical use only limited or no meaning .

the efficacy of abra@@ sion has been studied in a main study , in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received a anth@@ racycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some casting or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with my@@ stic patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 female patients , which received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of drugs such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients showed themselves in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , regarding these indicators that abra@@ sion , abra@@ sive , as conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or prior to the start of treatment low neutr@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ pay in the blood .
the Committee on Human Resour@@ ce Technology ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that , my@@ stic dre@@ amy , where the first treatment was no longer circul@@ ating , effective as conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that it has not to be given as opposed to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 shared the European Commission of the Econom@@ ist Bio Science Limited approved a permit for the marketing of abra@@ sion in the entire European Union .
abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients , where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for default anth@@ racycl@@ ine contained therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neutr@@ ons ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ . &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy during the abra@@ sion therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensor@@ ic neuro@@ pa@@ thy degrees 3 the treatment is to break down until a recovery is reached at level 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose has to be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with draw@@ backs of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .

Abra@@ x@@ ane is an album @-@ connected nan@@ op@@ arti@@ c acid by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be set immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no renewed abra@@ sion treatment cycles were initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ number has risen again on &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ m has risen back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ dor@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with abra@@ sion .
while a clearly defined with abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with imp@@ oto@@ x@@ icity in connection has not been proven , kar@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed Pati@@ ents may not be unusual , particularly in patients with earlier anth@@ racycl@@ ine treatment or underlying coron@@ ary disease .
if in the patient after the gift of my@@ stic nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pi@@ ous means .
abra@@ sion should not be used in pregnant or women of child@@ bearing age , which are not used for effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abra@@ sion .
male patients who are treated with abra@@ sion , is advised to witness during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment regarding a locking @-@ proof , since the therapy with abra@@ sion is the possibility of irrever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ sion can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can affect traffic and ability to operate machinery .
below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects specified in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the collection of important der@@ mat@@ ological toxicity ( at 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ anti @-@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the assemb@@ ling of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by im@@ itation of their dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ mer@@ ges has been convey@@ ed by plasma components in the cell cells and in the context of vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ th@@ elin cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ ce @-@ pel@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ album &apos;s recept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( t@@ ted PE@@ aci@@ dic Rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by 106 patients in two un@@ ambiguous denti@@ al studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients treated with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma with abra@@ sion , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma who received all 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent @-@ based chemotherapy ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ sion 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
with the inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and for the adjuv@@ ant treatment .

10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of abra@@ sion to patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma @-@ concentration took up a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide @-@ ranging ex@@ travag@@ ance distribution and / or ordination of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ lic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after an solvent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human micro@@ algae and tissue , reports will be reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily used to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and with two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ism ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

this means that se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and holds the same substance ( also called &quot; Reference for drugs &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which in connection with blood@@ trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the intervention is a self @-@ blood circulation , and in which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1500 ml .
the treatment with Ab@@ ol@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood @-@ don@@ ate is se@@ amed in a v@@ ene .
inj@@ ections may also be made by the patient or the super@@ visor if they have received proper guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ lation or in patients suffering from chemotherapy , the hooks should always be at the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ ag@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl with children ) .
the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron bar exists , and iron comple@@ xi@@ ers should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who get an chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body does not aband@@ on the body &apos;s body er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ an@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused an@@ emia , with the reference rate of reference .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either s@@ amed on se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicators for the efficacy was the change of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ equi@@ ties between the beginning of the study and the end period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin of spec@@ ulation @-@ t@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients infected with chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ es of patients were converted to se@@ amed to the same extent as those with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients received further E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase from 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ dul@@ lah is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ er @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that herein may be triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of the certificate , the medicine has been a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ dul@@ lah casts , will provide for the medical professional staff in all member States information packages , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for approval by Ab@@ dul@@ amed in the European Union .

the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ B &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in the planned larger surgical interventions , requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) .

H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an anticipated blood@@ loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied , which cannot be part in an aut@@ ologist blood@@ stream programme .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the h@@ itting B@@ ells bin@@ ations between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.6 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
the symptoms and symptoms of interest can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease , so assessing the individual clinical trial and disease state is required by the doctor .
a rise in the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) for a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual h@@ itting B@@ ells above or under h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - Tar@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
given this tick @-@ glo@@ bin@@ ability should be tried using an appropriate dose management , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bu@@ le is worth more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or when the permanent hem@@ line glo@@ ex is worth 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tion@@ able risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a s@@ lei@@ gh hat@@ ch as when going down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth .
additionally , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ amo@@ le or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can decrease in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ al symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is like in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ ah was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was evaluated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures via a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ cone ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases in the Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me build ) in the blood back norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
the study involving older women was reduced the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis in patients ) over a period of three years compared to the patients to plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
compared with all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those on plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients amongst plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent at repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs duties or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ades , patients are subject to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s risk of kidney , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clarification material for doctors , who contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how the medicine is applicable , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic re@@ frac@@ tory , the administration of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long re@@ version period has been observed in patients suffering from the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent sk@@ ating low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cture is recommended a initi@@ ating dose from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a In@@ fusion .
the frequency of the symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by a gift of par@@ l@@ ati@@ o or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney dis@@ rup@@ tive ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for children under 18 years of age , as data is missing for un@@ certain@@ ties and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because this patient population has only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ theses a@@ emia is performed before the treatment of as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a through adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bon@@ net , its maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the starting point up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting point up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the starting point up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. oral or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the tot@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .

the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment at an increase in the BM@@ D by 5,@@ 4 % on the total amount and by 4.3 % on the stake .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to indicate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ as compared to percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg deposits , compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months a similar withdrawal of pain and pain@@ k@@ ness was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a responsible study at the end of six month ( on the therapy ) were taken into a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate to participate in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be maintained in 141 of as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ a , compared to the average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .

the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 % of the applied dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes brought to the decrease in the customs clearance by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) .

a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Law ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained how the research committee has been judged to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a Di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric drug ) is not shown together with another diver@@ gence medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in for patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , which can be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ac or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ac or ins@@ ulin , can be kept as well as in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ fon@@ is@@ har@@ n@@ escent or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body @-@ specific ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar has to decrease , thus allowing to be better set of type 2 @-@ diabetes .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in this case , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ p , in addition they received either an account or plac@@ ebo for up to 3,5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates , how well the blood sugar has been adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels could be lo@@ wered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg used .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ p in a reduction of h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , where the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin , lowering the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients compared to plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and mort@@ gage ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to maturity ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who might in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver issues , heart in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic c@@ ac@@ aci@@ an ( high ket@@ one mirror - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( for all use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients should serve in which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 shared the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , approved by Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the magazine &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate to ins@@ ulin , where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac ar@@ rests or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of infection , weight gain or furn@@ aces , especially those with reduced cardi@@ op@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of infection , weight gain and furn@@ aces , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ ate out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular illness was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency showed what does not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output modules ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm@@ alisation ) or with other signs of a liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should not be inserted .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased by the 3 @-@ bit of the upper limit of the norm@@ ality , the liver enz@@ ym@@ y@@ ness is as soon as possible to control again .
if a patient developed symptoms , which refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , over@@ head , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , the liver values are to be checked .
the decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be guided to the fore @-@ out of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ o @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can com@@ prise of fatty deposits , and in some cases associated with a fluid time .
as a result of a series of hooks , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a lesser reduction in the middle chamber surface ( relative reduction to 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction to 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparison with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent even in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 1 @-@ 2 % , and ha@@ mat@@ oc@@ ation by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased in@@ sul@@ in@@ sensitivity to patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral branches or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ o @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch was reported among the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , over a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular disease with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ops who should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms when patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity , a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports und@@ es@@ irable events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.@@ 1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative drug .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for examining cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ental events , frac@@ tures from 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and in case a patient desire an pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is ab@@ at@@ ting ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ inhibit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on um the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ du@@ tor ) resulting in a lowering of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the breast reduction and thus reduce the availability of metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( this data will not be estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and break @-@ inde@@ xes of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic ingredients .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ as , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ege entered into the triple of the upper limit of the standard area frequently on like plac@@ ebo , but less frequent than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular illness , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was raised by 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
since the launch has rarely been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports und@@ es@@ irable events were random@@ ised from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients included in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative patients .
over a period of 3.5 years current pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures from 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug .
for taking the maximum dosage of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work via a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Ac@@ cur@@ ator g ) ) that leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , obesity and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ t in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to investigate the time up to the revival of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control has been defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients to be maintained ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in an plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ izing phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced itself around 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to received only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in clinical studies over a year , under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed an statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ stic compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks and examined by type 2 @-@ 2 di@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de , the total plastic @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statistical significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level has been established , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved in addition the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ inary Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular illness in groups random@@ ized , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ted , whereby the peak concentr@@ ations in un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one usually reaches 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is based on effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies it could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ du@@ tor ) and lowers the plasma concentration from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active sp@@ in@@ it@@ az@@ one in the human being , the marker was mainly found in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and throughout the entire active met@@ of metabolism , is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy pro@@ ban@@ ds , whereby the rates of the or@@ inal Clear@@ ance of the mother @-@ const@@ ancy is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and ape , according to repeti@@ tive administration , plasma @-@ magnific@@ ation with hooks , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to the fact that under the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the Gest@@ ation of the Hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the breast reduction and thus reduce the availability of metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ es in the rat @-@ rise by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in a animal model of the hom@@ olog@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment led with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons increased to an increased frequency of collagen .

in another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year more than Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed an statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ stic compared to the output values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but improved in addition the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on an effect on the tr@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study was l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary final point , which resulted in a combination of the tot@@ ality , non @-@ deadly law@@ ns , stroke , coron@@ ation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , place the results associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no car@@ di@@ ovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has been employed at a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 @-@ diabetes , in which the body is not able to effectively use the ins@@ ulin .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ der , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were reduced as strongly as with another human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who might be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
besides , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is available to packs of packages ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane increases in the treatment of diabetes to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission shared the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S by the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , approved by Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initi@@ al effect will be desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ecting needle must be har@@ ass@@ ed at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved considerably , for example , through a intensified in@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning @-@ symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin , long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin , long @-@ acting in@@ ulin , etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human@@ ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin delivery ) can cause that a change in dosage is required .
in case of change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane when a dosage adjustment is required , this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
travel that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his doctor , as such travels may lead to ins@@ ulin and meals at other times or must be taken .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult its patients after other drugs .
4 Bot@@ h hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia that can occur in any sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fer@@ to@@ d in uter@@ o .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can lead to consciousness and / or cr@@ amp@@ ant cases and end with temporary or lasting disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasionally - periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy as a rapid improvement of the blood sugar control can be associated with complaints , which are commonly referred to as acute @-@ known neuro@@ pa@@ thy and usually rever@@ sible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of ins@@ ulin therapy with a ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabe@@ tic ret@@ in@@ opath@@ y .
diseases of the skin and under@@ hau@@ tz@@ eli@@ sts web@@ es occasionally - Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy At the inj@@ ecting location can arise a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy , if failed to switch the intru@@ der within the inj@@ ecting area .
general conditions and complaints on appointment occasionally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction to inj@@ ecting location during the ins@@ ulin therapy can occur local over@@ received actions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ om in the inj@@ ecting location ) .
diseases of the immune system occasionally - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them very rare - an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reactions of gener@@ aliz@@ ations , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tish oils , fi@@ erce , low blood pressure and impotence / consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop in stages : • Glu@@ e Mor@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be handled by the or@@ ale supply of glu@@ c@@ ose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have trau@@ ma pieces , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice in itself . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid with consciousness are treated with a in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting of Glu@@ c@@ agon or by glu@@ c@@ ose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the activity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of activity is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ p@@ ation profile lays in it because the product is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of arrangements ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places at the Hum@@ per@@ ul@@ ence molec@@ ule were considered ; none of them are active through the spl@@ its of them .
based on conventional studies on security , toxicity , toxicity in repeat@@ ability , Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , to the car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic potential and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ari@@ sto@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane flow@@ ed bottle was removed from the fridge - the temperature of the ins@@ ulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) , before it is used under the manual for the first use res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult its patients after other drugs .
12 Bot@@ h hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia that can occur in any sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fer@@ to@@ d in uter@@ o .
13 A intensi@@ fication of the ins@@ ulin therapy with a ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabe@@ tic ret@@ in@@ opath@@ y .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life time ( t ½ ) is therefore more a measure of the or@@ ption as a measure of elimination per se of ins@@ ulin from the plasma ( ins@@ ulin has in the blood circulation a t ½ of just a few minutes ) .

if the ur@@ inary seed after two to four weeks is still up more than 6 mg per de@@ ath@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , still tox@@ ics may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic or more medicines for preventing tox@@ ic@@ ation .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transp@@ lan@@ tation because it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to a plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ cr@@ ates ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ ch@@ emia ) .
two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily , 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary seeds were in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg recorded , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients , which took once daily 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary bar in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison to this , this was with 22 % ( 60 from 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal living levels .

primary End@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney function The AP@@ EX @-@ Study acknow@@ le@@ dges the effectiveness at 40 patients with kidney @-@ shaped ren@@ ces ( d. ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy is at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration at pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a serv@@ o concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open compar@@ atively study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ seed shares on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ ene / l ) ass@@ aul@@ ted a treatment against a gyp@@ sum treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the sy@@ no@@ dal figure , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gi@@ ants to the month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) received a long term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ ate ( 5.6 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.6 % ) in the open long @-@ time studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
for healthy prob@@ es , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface at the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations Time @-@ Cur@@ ve ( AU@@ C ) has increased by F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multi@@ dimensional doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ has dis@@ proportionate increase .

however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage is observed in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved via the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg once .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid an irrit@@ ation of food pipes , the patient is allowed to take care of until after the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ath and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from other medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also introduced a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin C mir@@ rors were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also placed the data that contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE doses are exactly the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , scar@@ c@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , sp@@ icy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , sp@@ icy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( brow@@ sed belly ) , as well as aci@@ di@@ zing b@@ ump .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ iger over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components of the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients unable to stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ar@@ y@@ 2007 the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or dispos@@ able medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following hints are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is made . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest , 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood or surgical interventions at the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
eco @-@ sop@@ ran@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ran@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ero@@ tures , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ ps , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially , these severe cases were severe and required a hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised to refer to potential offensive reactions and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of men@@ op@@ ha@@ ired irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie , pain , swal@@ lowing , or retro@@ spec@@ ulating so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy @-@ ha@@ ired side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take correctly and / or refer to the appearance of symptoms that refer to an op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all the dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large set of clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk was determined , rare ( after market introduction ) gast@@ ric and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe , and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the dis@@ appearance of a Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of an Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta of the pine .
clinical evaluation by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take them in the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after having noticed their failure .

main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was cr@@ ashed after a year of treatment ( by example examined , how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been conducted to 119 patients with kidney transp@@ lan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transp@@ lan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ raf is added to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ endor@@ sion or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ ri@@ val@@ ence .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tigh@@ tening control of an experienced physician in the tran@@ spl@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in consequence of an conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in the individual case and on blood levels . ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations

patients with reduced kidney function since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ical potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ otonin levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ence and an monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .

it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks after transp@@ lan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the recovery therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after converting Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , modifications of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred con@@ gest@@ ation ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies allow to conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the mirror mirror can not exceed in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the bottom mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transp@@ lan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in ren@@ al and heart transp@@ lan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent eradication of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients were usually used in blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe und@@ es@@ irable events , including transp@@ lan@@ ting and other side effects that may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ ground or Ex@@ pos@@ ure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tigh@@ tening control of an experienced physician in the tran@@ spl@@ ant physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transp@@ lan@@ tion and transp@@ lan@@ tion of adult heart transp@@ lan@@ ts and tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in the chin @-@ old are still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded wording Adv@@ ag@@ raf in front of .
because of possible interactions that may result in a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ tical mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other herbal medicines during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations performed in the blood as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a Car@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y was observed in chamber or Sept@@ al hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also be found under Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
additional factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ici@@ an disorders are an existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney stress , kidney stress and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ va the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection using a high protection factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take , symptoms for pr@@ es such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ ushing and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ du@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the current gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain constant concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

Hoch@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute cases of rep@@ ul@@ sive actions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us has been metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolism , which imp@@ air metabolism .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormonal balance , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures to be especially careful .
the results of animal trials have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and increase their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of investigations on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ va , a heigh@@ tened risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .

the dosage and frequency of the application varies according to whether it is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .

it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human Ger@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is another medicine approved in the European Union named Re@@ fr@@ at@@ uses , but will be otherwise made , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human@@ istic or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the drug application was examined by preventing blood tests as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( F@@ ie@@ ber ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for the marketing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment should be based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII of VIII , according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following t@@ mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ory events , the factor VIII activity within the corresponding period is not decrease to the indicated plasma bars ( in % of the standard or in ) / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years of age ) , until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , it is recommended to control the dose and the incidence of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma @-@ bricks .
single patients can differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half times .

if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the administration speed is expected to comply with the patient and the maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alization antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A .

based on the data available since the first use of the data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be considered positive , but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
thus , the CH@@ MP is based on the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes an filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that regulatory authorities should apply for 5 years for further procedures .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited with the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially approved that the company reco@@ vers his application for approval by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) .
this is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified , that it can carry out a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there cannot be copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ent should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the not def@@ ective in the human body of existing p@@ 53 gene , bears usually the restoration of corrupt DNA and kill the cells if the DNA could not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is faul@@ ty , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of construction , into the bones and the brain .
after CH@@ MP tested the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP documents a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ is in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active substance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so set together , that one of the effective constitu@@ ents will be released immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ ity ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is to be taken twice a day , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ op@@ ed nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be im@@ pl@@ ated on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main contribut@@ ors were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ s ymp@@ tom@@ ome that were reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients took their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when evaluating all the hypo@@ cr@@ ative ymp@@ ic symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ ina@@ ze , reported via a decrease in the symptoms around 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 35@@ ,@@ 9 % in the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a relief of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ men ( coron@@ ation ) , di@@ sti@@ p@@ hic hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ed@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ nia , and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other constitu@@ ents , against adequate medicines or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used in patients suffering from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( higher @-@ pressure ) , ur@@ inary or v@@ ascular diseases ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid gland ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid gland ) or had already caused a ha@@ il@@ rh@@ ag@@ onian stroke ( caused by a brain blood ) or have had a risk for an ha@@ mor@@ tal stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing event of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , can be swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without dis@@ ruption , to break or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied due to the failure of data for un@@ certain@@ ties and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the time of use on 10 days since by long @-@ term use the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
according to the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued in need with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
da Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ oxi@@ dise ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .

the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not sufficient to utter@@ ance the recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to utter@@ ance the recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be kept informed that treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or any strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be set .
when treating the following patients , patients are treated with cardi@@ ac patients • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac ar@@ rests in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bronze age in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ op@@ ia has been dis@@ advoc@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin transactions or reduce to their extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally have been administered were however no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the results of the psych@@ o @-@ medical test could not be significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzy@@ me responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ p@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ des in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the invali@@ dity of the use of aer@@ os@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals do not always be transmitted to the human being and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ory properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied about it that in very rare cases it may come to a stu@@ per , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of per@@ sever@@ ity or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a tick @-@ depression ( Se@@ dierung , Ap@@ nea , reduction of mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular cur@@ ity ) and a tw@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , stair@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation is especially probable with children , as well as A@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ wash , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ ery / Bas@@ ophil@@ es one as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesive molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
for a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective no@@ bility or the tasks connected to flying .
in controlled clinical trials in the recommended dosage of 5 mg there was no increased frequency of stro@@ kes compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ ds or manifestations of a tw@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determined according to the overall way for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance on days ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
there were further studies presented to verify that the body is the sy@@ rup to pick up the solution and the mel@@ ting in the same way utilized as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symptoms from six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe for approval by A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ animal and Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical studies on the efficacy of the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mit@@ es allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the date of the disease and can be ended after the end of the symptoms and at its return will be res@@ umed .
in the Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been determined within the framework of clin@@ ici@@ at@@ adin tablets in the framework of which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , at con@@ current intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the efficient effect of alcohol is not enhanced ( see below section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ per , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients suffering with plac@@ ebo .
the most frequently asked side effects , which was more common than in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ related head@@ ache , that occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , administered by up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ ery / Bas@@ ophil@@ es one as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesive molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days has not been statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls .
at a single dose - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg not influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective no@@ bility or the tasks connected to flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ am@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ rupt allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the resulting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the occurrence of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall appearance of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhino @-@ con@@ jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically Idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was re@@ pres@@ en@@ tive for other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physiological tics in the various forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively ignored .
since the H@@ ist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ is@@ ment is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ tic diseases , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine performs aside in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was a@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction in size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients , who were not re@@ acted to Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine , from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and on@@ eness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmaceutical study study , in which the patients have been comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , was achieved with 4 % of patients achieved greater concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
this has not been responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . however , it has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not excluded completely
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ des in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ animal and private allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the tigh@@ ter doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years of age ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exist , which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , should play a role in the diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical tests and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of metabo@@ li@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine to experience a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted to metabo@@ li@@ zing , is identical to the children which are normal metabo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients suffer from her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glu@@ c@@ ose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absor@@ bing or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ ices of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not determined within the framework of clin@@ ici@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , while simultaneously taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the efficient effect of alcohol is not enhanced ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as at the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients suffering with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dosage study of adults and adolescents , administered by up to 45 mg of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily dis@@ ap@@ ur@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( at the age between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic zo@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be seen by the children &apos;s population in extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ ert .
as part of a clinical study with multi@@ plying to adults and adolescents , applied in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days was not statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study conducted by adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical trials included in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of beats compared to plac@@ ebo .
for a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies have no effect on the Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to an increase of alcohol in@@ duced performance , nor to increase the ability of beats .
in adults and young patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ am@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ch , l@@ ur@@ ging , and redness of eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the basis of the overall appearance of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino @-@ con@@ jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets can effectively pass by the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was a@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction in size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this limited metabo@@ lic phen@@ otyp@@ e was equivalent to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic parameters were examined in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ plying study with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulating to children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted to scru@@ pul@@ ously observed .

in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ rupt allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as shown by the overall appearance of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhino @-@ con@@ jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this limited metabo@@ lic phen@@ otyp@@ e was equivalent to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. with the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) officially approved that the company will withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ ek , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ ek emerges , which can easily spread from man to person , because human beings still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the anti @-@ pe@@ ek @-@ virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and constitutes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system later is able to form in contact with a cri@@ p@@ pe@@ ek @-@ virus of this pedi@@ ms fast antibodies .
subsequently , the membrane envel@@ ope of the virus by the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) split up and used as an element of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the extent of clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine will not be taken to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA ( MEA ) guidelines for prehistoric vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s care physician .
for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are associated with the human@@ ic immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , it &apos;s not available as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral medicines has previously been taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has assessed that the virus will address the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four to twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
am@@ gener@@ ase reduces with intake in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines that keeps HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the immune system &apos;s immune system and thus also delay the development of AIDS associated infections and ail@@ ments .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , previously had not been treated with Prot@@ ests .
that with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , formerly prot@@ eas@@ ers formerly compared with other prot@@ eas@@ ers .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ white concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously been not a prot@@ oc@@ ate previously , after 48 weeks , more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last among 400 copies / ml than below plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase was also the Vir@@ us@@ last , however with the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , very few of the treatment .
in the study with adults , which had previously been treated with Prot@@ ests , that has been treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other Prot@@ eas@@ ers :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resist@@ ent against four other proteins , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who continued up their previous prototype :
the most common side effects of A@@ generi@@ c ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ algam or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients suffering or herbal ( herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs which are just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the a@@ generi@@ c acid ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y ( decl@@ ining of bone tissue ) or an immune response syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system &apos;s immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Genetics ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years facing the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic res@@ o@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set firmly that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously had not been a prot@@ ector .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since the approval was limited for scientific reasons for scientific reasons .
October 2000 distributed the European Commission to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of the general public in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ector ( PI ) treated for adults and children older than 4 years of age .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are intended to be administered for pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ th@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance cord and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to income is by 14 % lower than of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solutions are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generi@@ c capsules is 600 mg am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) must be applied , higher doses must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generi@@ c capsules is 20 mg am@@ in@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ nest@@ y which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ ology , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protein bugs have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for children under 4 years of age , due to the failure of data for un@@ certain@@ ties and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic range and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pl@@ uses ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generi@@ c or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
typically , A@@ generi@@ c capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk for serious liver interactions with potentially deadly disease .
for the event of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis also show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which switches over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is excessive using the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ nu@@ is@@ cop@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ sore and supple@@ mentation of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the fuel @-@ changing of H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ sen .
4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ised Ratio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ generi@@ c can be less effective due to reduced plasma bricks of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ deficiency symptoms , especially if they are also under@@ min@@ uted even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high pro@@ men@@ gly@@ col in the A@@ generi@@ c solution to income , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on a permanent basis , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ esters , has been reported by the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ as@@ tical circle of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy medications were necessary to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders , associated with cancer .
Pre@@ m@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports on an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous com@@ po@@ ons and hem@@ ost@@ eo@@ arthritis .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective , at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) developed an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fact@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ ology , higher Body Mass Mass ) , were reported cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic range and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicinal drugs , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected for the increased plastic bars with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r causes which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma @-@ levels through a dosage increase of other protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very frequently unwanted effects in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ ving levels of am@@ in@@ avi@@ r can be brought by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ine@@ ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
when a patient is already in@@ duced anti@@ quity , the am@@ pl@@ uses blood levels and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and reduce the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for any of the drugs is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand over 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ avi@@ r has been applied twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment rental .
52 % low when Am@@ ber avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was administered twice per day ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Knights ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is not a tigh@@ tly monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene , however , due to the viol@@ ating component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require a dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ oc@@ ation ehem@@ ently would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ers and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ viral in the serv@@ itude of am@@ algam could possibly sen@@ ct .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din will be less effective because of the decreased or maybe sub@@ therapeutic plastic bars could be less effective .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and thus to an increase in ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
if for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , to a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmaceutical studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma @-@ bar of both medicines could be raised in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ou@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or In@@ du@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with as@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as ashes as it may come to res@@ or@@ p@@ ulation .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as an enzy@@ min@@ du@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma seal of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium pet@@ als such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , sty@@ modi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ asi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ asi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ alg@@ am@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plastic concentr@@ ations and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ age , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly higher , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ depth interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous G@@ gener@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ c@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment is excessive using the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ mor@@ tal effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A @-@ S@@ inj@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , their metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced enhancements of the plasma @-@ bars with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
because Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ le increases of these H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with am@@ di@@ avi@@ r .
there will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabil@@ isation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous casting of am@@ algam ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , aspir@@ ation cannot be applied together with oral cu@@ bic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ent@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simult@@ ani@@ ous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plastic bar of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am in order to fold up to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ deficiency symptoms , especially if they are also under@@ min@@ uted even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the due to low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adapt when Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Normal@@ Ratio ) because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not pres@@ et@@ able , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current gift of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medication may only be used for pregnancy just after careful execution of possible utility for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated re@@ rats were detected am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r passes on people into mother &apos;s milk .
a Re@@ production study to fru@@ ity pen@@ um@@ ers that was administered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us until the end of the st@@ agnation time of Am@@ in@@ avi@@ r during the l@@ ac@@ tation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight at night .
the further development of the offspring including fertili@@ zation and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ alg@@ am@@ avi@@ r to the dam@@ s .
the im@@ min@@ ality of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were easy to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the prevention of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ector had not previously received patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were promoted by the test doctors as in connection with the study medication and were performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are performed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV sufferers , including a loss of periph@@ eral and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hia and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hia of breasts and dor@@ so@@ br@@ al fat collection ( stit@@ ching ) .

in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 the patients treated under Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various NGOs about a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ ku@@ ed paper with or without it@@ ch and occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without having to dis@@ miss the treatment with am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r .
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective , at the time the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections . ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously described patients , the 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase were observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values , which received in patients who were as@@ gener@@ ase , along with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is on an indication of an ins@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .

anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B has been studied in both ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected devices ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ fit patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were - like with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r b@@ oo@@ ph@@ emed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ esters inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
with sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ fit patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ou@@ tre@@ avi@@ r received with 100@@ mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ic &apos; say up to week 48 , where 14 isolation could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the ins@@ ulators of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure had not joined forces within the 59 , showed resistance patterns , which were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ GA I , I@@ 2@@ I , V@@ 33@@ E , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , G@@ 5@@ 4@@ L / M / V , Q@@ 5@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) participated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ oc@@ ation @-@ mut@@ ations :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance measurement systems , analy@@ sing the activity of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be applied in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / L , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ A / L / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a cr@@ ashed phenomen@@ al resistance and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data and it is recommended to always move the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
in a phenomen@@ al resistance of pesti@@ cides in connection with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic analyses of interpre@@ ting the activity of am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that can distribute the diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cr@@ us@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resist@@ ence between am@@ muni@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ esters for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , In@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , Sat@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , San@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , invo@@ ke ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) .
the other way round , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ulator .
the early cancellation of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a large number of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial ( NR@@ O ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with an PI , primarily with a lower tape , du@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos; , received .
one @-@ hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least an NGO were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ under@@ proof of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the N@@ C @-@ PI @-@ Group in terms of time @-@ saving ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ growth threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of ru@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ il@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generi@@ c solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily was obtained , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , roughly 25 % of the study included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation for the children who are expected to be expected to be assumed by &quot; unfair advantage &quot; as@@ gener@@ als .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 up to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ nest@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of ru@@ ined am@@ pl@@ uses which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ pl@@ uses remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the dosage assistance in the Ste@@ ady State control over the range from C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines , which will in@@ duce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ generi@@ c capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the ren@@ al clearing is neglected from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which is why the effect of a kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder may be low on the elimination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r plasma monitors , comparable to those who are obtained to healthy regul@@ ators after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ eh@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ oes with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in doses at doses at the 2,@@ 0 @-@ triple ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to the humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ nest@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ mel has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure to people , both clinical studies and therapeutic applications , however , there are little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity tests , the bacterial cells of mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ els on rats and chromos@@ ome degra@@ dation on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
this liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us .
previously , in clinical studies there has not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during administration of as@@ gener@@ ase , even after the end of treatment .
studies on the tox@@ ic@@ ation were treated with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed high Mor@@ t@@ ality in the control as well as with am@@ algam patients .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher under ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage with humans , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and lower skel@@ eton changes were observed , which refer to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) must be applied , higher doses must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generi@@ c capsules is 20 mg am@@ in@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ nest@@ y which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application shall be with caution in patients with wa@@ iter or light liver disorder , in case of patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ised Ratio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set over a period of 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r causes which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand over 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Knights ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is not a tigh@@ tly monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ oc@@ ation ehem@@ ently would be low .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium pet@@ als such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , sty@@ modi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ asi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ asi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ alg@@ am@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly higher , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ depth interval 82 to 89 % ) .
con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Normal@@ Ratio ) because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ eth@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ im@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r by 22 % resp@@ .
this medication may only be applied to pregnancy just after careful execution of possible utility for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a Re@@ production study to fru@@ ity pen@@ um@@ ers , which was administered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ in@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the body weight at night .
the im@@ min@@ ality of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is on an indication of an ins@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B has been studied in both ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected devices ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
the other way round , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ulator .
based on these data should be considered during therapy optimization in the children who are expected to be expected to be considered as expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ treated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ pl@@ uses remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the dosage assistance in the Ste@@ ady State control over the range from C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines , which will in@@ duce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al clearing house of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore the effect of a kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder may be low on the elimination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ did@@ acy with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in doses at doses at the 2,@@ 0 @-@ triple ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans to twice daily use of 1200 mg Am@@ nest@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of the h@@ ep@@ at@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ mel has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure to people , both clinical studies and the therapeutic application there are little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity tests , the bacterial cells of mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ els on rats and chromos@@ ome effects on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
studies on the tox@@ ic@@ ation were treated with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed high Mor@@ t@@ ality in the control as well as with am@@ algam patients .
these results allow to conclude that in juven@@ iles , the Met@@ abol@@ isation ways are not fully developed , so am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inc@@ eption is in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ oc@@ ate @-@ treated adults and children older than 4 years of age .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; bund@@ les &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; has not been assigned to patients nor with PI previously described patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to income is by 14 % lower than of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solutions are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .

the application rigi@@ dity and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara is applied to the type of treatment : • At F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area Al@@ dara is to apply five weeks a week until a maximum of 16 weeks , during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is inf@@ ant in front of the bed@@ time di@@ pl@@ ating on the affected skin areas so that they are sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on your skin before it is washed off .
in all trials Al@@ dara was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete separation of the treated patients . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma treated in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or plac@@ ebo were either daily or five times a week .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in genital area was the full assignment rate in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % among patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions at the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine creams is so long to continue until all the visible fo@@ ams in the genital or per@@ ic@@ ardi@@ ans are gone , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the above treatment process should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment range a infection is observed .
if follow up @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons were treated only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient was wearing the cream , once he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan .

in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ famili@@ arity had been conducted , two cases of severe phi@@ mos@@ is and one case were observed with one to circumc@@ ision .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an elevated risk is observed for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , also under proper use severe local skin irrit@@ ation have been observed , which made a treatment required and / or to have temporary impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occur at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties when water@@ shed , which made an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
in connection to the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , immediately following a treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an applied means for the treatment of extreme war@@ ts in genital and per@@ ic@@ ardi@@ al@@ ment there are currently no clinical experiences before .
limited data is true to an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ war@@ y @-@ reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine creams , in this patient group has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
the treatment of the ba@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions come back after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin transactions , a treatment gap of several days can be made .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after the treatment , we should consider other suitable therapy forms for super@@ vis@@ ors .
in patients with recur@@ rent and prescribed BC@@ Cs do not lie a clinical experience , so the application was not recommended for previously used tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip @-@ field inside the lip@@ se .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute p@@ ants to anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
the available data about the acute ker@@ at@@ ose of the sub @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this purpose of application , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually take place during the treatment of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient are big discomfort or very strong , the treatment may be exposed to several days .
from the data of an open clinical trial investig@@ ates patients with more than 8 A@@ K@@ - lesi@@ ons a lower full healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating qualities , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine creams should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies , there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic / f@@ öt@@ al development , the band@@ aging or the post@@ nat@@ al development . ( see 5.3 ) .
although it can be reached either after a mal@@ ic application of quanti@@ fied top@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation to apply during the l@@ ac@@ tation period .
the most frequently visited and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine creams in connection side effects in the studies with three times of weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of treatment of appropri@@ ate@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.2 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &#93; patients ) .

the study was mainly investig@@ ating the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect in terms of reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me die of G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children passed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , mental pain , rash , skin pain , pain @-@ pain , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardiovascular ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not respond to patients who may be severe ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information every year that may be known to examine and update this summary as required .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is maintained patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. in approval for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cellular cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ve of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase fault ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabo@@ lic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , all 15 minutes in single steps to a maxim@@ ize dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ ix has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion conditioned reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be super@@ vised , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment , to be immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , the fact that nearly all patients of Ig@@ or antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients , antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer interruption , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity to be cau@@ tious after a interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ise the potential appearance of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a light or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and Par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considering .
in@@ fusion can be included with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ is@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the pre @-@ equ@@ ated reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ca@@ ine because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that have been expon@@ ential compared to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , it is recommended to not satisfy during the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects in clinical trials were derived mainly as in@@ fusion conditioned reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
unwanted remedies in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there have been severe reactions to , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ ic , respiratory resistance and fac@@ i@@ ards ( see section 4.4 ) .
children of unwanted drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy displ@@ ace size and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age with a heavy circulation system ( on average after 26 days after 45 days with patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature output from the study ) were submitted in 13 / 45 patients no by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ int@@ ag@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay veri@@ fiable antibodies before , including 3 patients , in which there was never too ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with mis@@ lead levels led to a robust reduction of G@@ AG refle@@ ctor in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal inhibit@@ ory effects on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to not imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse health agents , even though the occurrence of und@@ es@@ irable pharmaceutical agents typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accumulation of acceptable restoration of the enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients was caught up by the Middle phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute enclosure in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- o@@ bedi@@ ence .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label study study , where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement in the lung function and the o@@ bedi@@ ence shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed up in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period of time and the total volume of the total volume increases constantly proportional to the body size .
from 26 patients with h@@ ep@@ hal@@ eg@@ aly performed in front of treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal life size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop of G@@ AG mir@@ rors was fixed at the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the degree of study .
with regard to hetero@@ geneous patho@@ gens between patients who have been taken into account by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ations in the age of 5 patients ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it has been conducted a one @-@ year open phase 2 study , in which mainly the security and Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals in 20 patients were examined , which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with the middle age form ) .
in four patients the dosage increased by increased G@@ AG@@ C levels in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
several patients were a size growth ( s = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been fixed after the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle vertical form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle vertical form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) , whereas in the elderly patients were det@@ ained in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ metering schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the metering scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses of these two doses is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .

therefore , all patients must be instru@@ cted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive l@@ actic measure for reduction of treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous taking non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ation ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .

many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the result will be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac ar@@ rests , and dis@@ cereb@@ ral events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ties ( except for yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a irrever@@ sible inj@@ ecting of the reproductive @-@ conduc@@ tivity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - would be advised to obtain advice on spar@@ ing security .

it is applied in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a cal@@ orie intake .
patients who may take no weight after 12 weeks should be reported to their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not dismant@@ le some fats into the food , thereby causing a quarter of those with food @-@ led fats Un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 when compared with an BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies on patients with an BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , over 2,@@ 3 kg during the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study involving All@@ i in patients with an BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients of relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are bi@@ ous stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with Stu@@ h@@ ote , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ st , fet@@ al / maneu@@ ver , precip@@ itation ( wind ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients suffering with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ welding in transp@@ lan@@ tation ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term painting syndrome ( in which case not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver illness ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the launch of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the European Union .
alli is applied to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alli may not be applied by children and young people under 18 , since not enough data is available for effectiveness and security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal in the el@@ der and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adaptation of the dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) • breast@@ feeding ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) • Dur@@ ate treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fat @-@ rich se@@ hl@@ age or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with an improved metabo@@ lic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted .
patients who have taken as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted to this medicinal product .
it is recommended to meet extra @-@ advised measures in order to remedy the oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on interaction effects of medicines as well as in several cases involving or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed an absorption of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma plastic .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be the Quick @-@ values ( internationally regular ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at were the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the norm@@ ality area .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , in case of a limited number of volunteers , received at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , a reduced decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal of nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the prevalence are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data are not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects that were determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uneven size .
• It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli gains effect with regard to potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
retailers of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multiple types of doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight pro@@ ban@@ den without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either any side @-@ effects or similar side effects as with the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at have been reported .
based on research and animal studies may be trac@@ ed from a rapid rep@@ lication of system@@ ic system@@ ic effects that can be trac@@ ed to the li@@ tig@@ ated properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper lim@@ b intest@@ ine to the active serv@@ o @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and pan@@ atic lifts .
clinical trials were derived from that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with an BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 reflect the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ic acid level .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight in relation to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been reviewed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost over 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed for 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output worth 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( initial worth 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output worth 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output worth 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change @-@ girth was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentration from not metabo@@ li@@ zed Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , for therapeutic doses , not metabo@@ lic or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a g@@ ulation .
in a study involving adi@@ tional patients , which was administered minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased dose , two main metabol@@ ite , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ um Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after folding of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , which presented the approximate 42 % of the total plastic concentration .
based on conventional studies on security cre@@ at@@ ology , toxicity in repeat@@ ability , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , can@@ v@@ ised potential and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ari@@ toxicity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized as a special danger to the human being .

the most common side @-@ effects depend on the functioning of the capsules , and thereby arise that more fats are eliminated from the body .
these side effects generally occur within the first weeks after treatment course , as you have perhaps not significantly reduced the obesity in the diet at this time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional def@@ ective le@@ dges : • Beg@@ inners already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ching nour@@ ished diet . • Get more about the usual Fett@@ sa@@ ws of your favourite dish and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that you can cross your fat loss . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fatty rates ev@@ enly on the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to have it done in the form of a fat main course or a full post @-@ weight st@@ amping . • Most people in which these accompanying publications occur , they learn to control these with the time through adjustment of their diet .
• Health care for children in@@ accessible . • You may not apply respectively for the exp@@ ir@@ ation stated on the credit card . • The containers is firmly closed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed container with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ atic antibiotic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
this means that the active ingredient the bond of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ is was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ o@@ therapies were received , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that have been treated strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ is ( 119 by 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission shared the Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals Ltd . approval for the launch of Alo@@ is in the whole of the European Union .
Alo@@ is is indi@@ cted : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer disease and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting into moderate @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy based on cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi is induc@@ ing in the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induc@@ ing by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding any given by the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the dick@@ head patients , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ ing ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ conscious I@@ le@@ us after injection moulding machine .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to extend such extension .
except in connection with another chemical therapeu@@ tical gift , Alo@@ is should not be used in the days following chemotherapy to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron considered against tum@@ ors oriented activity of the five examined chemical therapeu@@ tics . ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial did not prove a significant pharmac@@ o@@ tic interplay between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ ure concentration , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ o@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ atten@@ de@@ ine , ca@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , k@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , k@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , k@@ ic@@ or@@ din , k@@ ic@@ or@@ gy , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is necessary by the treating doctor than necessary .
in clinical trials were the most common among a dose of 250 micro@@ grams for monitoring side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were in connection with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ received actions and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were published in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies were reported by und@@ es@@ irable events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted , due to the large number of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in a alo@@ xi@@ de over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received an oc@@ re @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 c@@ lic@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 ( half @-@ value 3 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without de@@ x@@ eth@@ as@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study total of 667 patients , who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared that were 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to intraven@@ ous in 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ing nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clin@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic and re@@ pol@@ arization involved in the v@@ entri@@ es@@ can@@ als and to prolong the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in retailers of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows the initi@@ alization of plasma concentration , a slow elimination of the body with an average rating time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface at the concentr@@ ations time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally located throughout the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ / kg in healthy and canc@@ ers dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations suggests that the total exposure of € 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg total value ; however , the C@@ max after penetration of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ism that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enc@@ me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reported approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous case for healthy blood the total physical value of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing period 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver disorder the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation de@@ fle@@ ction and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dosage is therefore not justified .
in pre@@ clinical studies , effects were observed only by positions that are considered sufficiently above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical studies were evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of ion@@ ic can@@ als , who are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can extend the potential for action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given in about the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given every day over two years led to an increased frequency of liver be@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ mark ) and skin lesi@@ ons on rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of the high doses and since Alo@@ is destined for a unique application , the relevance of these results are dimin@@ ished than for humans .

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , recommended for the approval of the medication provided to the treatment of h@@ epatitis C for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon of a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A similar to the same practitioner is similar to that already in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference for drugs &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) h@@ epatitis C ( one by an viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue shows damage , in addition the values of the liver enzy@@ me Alan@@ y@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) also increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon made data that is the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , efficacy , safety and effectiveness at h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with h@@ epatitis C , the effectiveness of the Reference case study was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have been thoroughly expressed that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug market .
the number of patients infected with h@@ epatitis C , which focused on treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease was re @-@ taught in more patients than at the reference rate ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
aside from that , the test carried out in the study to determine the extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) dis@@ sol@@ ves , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ peti@@ tions ( one with cru@@ de formation of incoming skin infection ) and small infected in@@ ths ( crack or sn@@ apshots ) , abra@@ sions and paraly@@ sis wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were neglected or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against this type of infections may not be affected .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient fails to approach the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacterial , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ oned after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.3 % ) of 71 patients among plac@@ ebo were talking on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected animals , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ ex@@ in has reported similar response : if the results of both studies have been taken on hand @-@ depth , about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of down@@ side ( eit@@ er@@ ed hol@@ low in the physique ) or of infections , which were veri@@ fiable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the plant .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections . • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ compar@@ atively small la@@ er@@ ations , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients , in which two to three days do not show improvement , should be investigated once and be considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin gene , the treatment is designed to carefully scru@@ pul@@ sing the balance and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies on secondary wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ent st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deterioration of the infected space will occur .
the effect of the simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plastic concentr@@ ations that were reached with people under topical application , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Acc@@ ording of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ic application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ v@@ ault to be protected from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered required when topical re@@ ap@@ l@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
Ti@@ erst@@ udi@@ en have shown a re@@ production capacity after or@@ derly intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indi@@ visible and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / termin@@ ated , is to derive the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the al@@ tar@@ go was used , was the most frequent re @-@ effect irrit@@ ation to the administration of which approximately 1 % of the patients concerned .
effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ate from Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , which is isolated through fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us ( formerly Ple@@ as@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the drug mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ins@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a specific ties of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the links of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the connecting @-@ place protein level L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ ine .
through bond to this links in@@ hibit Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , blocking partly P @-@ links and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ous sub@@ units .
should be considered due to the local prevalence of the resistance to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulators were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ act Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) will be considered .

from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ b twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ic treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma tubes were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 by adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

Ambi@@ rix is applied for protection against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ inations , with a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccines can be led to an end from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desirable against h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis A@@ - or B vaccine will be given .
vaccines act by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it may arise against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine has been approved since 1996 and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same disease , but Twin@@ rix will be administered for adults and Twin@@ rix children under one of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are included identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of an protective anti@@ body .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six months and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took place between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti@@ body concentr@@ ations against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to a six @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain , and the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as ri@@ val@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is allowed in patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) will not be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission shared the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . a permit for the transfer of ambitions in the whole
the standardis@@ ed plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ alli@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is scheduled at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a f@@ iss@@ ant weapon is desired both for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ ING ) antibodies in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ oli@@ tic vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed up whether or less competent persons , who are addressed to a h@@ epatitis C , as they are also no longer percep@@ tible antibodies , as they are protected by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 . as with all inj@@ ecting , for the rare case , an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the use of the vaccine will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is necessary , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination of combination is recommended , the 360 ELISA @-@ units format@@ ted h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B surface .
with ha@@ x@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ body is achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vaccine may be required .
because an intra@@ oral inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration in the v@@ ascular compromise could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine success , should be avoided these inj@@ ected air@@ ways .
with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected in such cases as it can come to in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular tra@@ ys in these cases .
when Ambi@@ rix had served in the second quarter in the form of a separate inj@@ ector , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated carbon vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined masks , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that may not be an adequate immune response .

in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix compared to that of the 3 doses of combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher prevalence of pain and mat@@ ologists on a rating basis per vaccine Ambi@@ rix not , but not on a basis of calculation per person .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ iss@@ ing face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with h@@ epatitis or h@@ epatitis B virus , although the entire vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with h@@ epatitis or h@@ epatitis B virus already infected with h@@ epatitis or h@@ epatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill to the vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections , which are damaging the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those after a h@@ epatitis or h@@ epatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If there is already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has shown .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin r@@ ashes , respiratory illness or attacks against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • If you / your child has ever performed an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined incidence of h@@ epatitis B / h@@ epatitis B vaccine with a reduced sal@@ h@@ epatitis ( 360 ELISA units of a formal h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content to effective component is usually administered a month after the first dose and might give you a vacc@@ ination before termination of the vacc@@ ination .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix suffer from those who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disorder or treatment in your body @-@ based dis@@ system , or if you / your child has been sub@@ trac@@ ed from a here@@ of .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of those individuals may not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ ars your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated by having been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned or in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated to separate places and as different li@@ mbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is supposed to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix not administered pregnant or nursing women except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated by both h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has become known since issuing the first approval for the traffic traffic , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit risk @-@ relationship with Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix had only been distributed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ o can also be used for patients aged over a month using in@@ complete enzy@@ me def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephalopath@@ y ( brain injury as a result of high mon@@ am@@ moni@@ y fixing ) in the pre @-@ history .
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps - split on several single @-@ tro@@ users to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( due to the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a hypo@@ medication , i.e. without a substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also improve loss of loss , a ab@@ usive aci@@ dity of blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , om@@ iting , fatigue or taste , stomach pain , p@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , con@@ ges@@ tion , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , rash , or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high mon@@ am@@ moni@@ ac can be effectively prevented .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine may result in .
the use is indi@@ cted in all patients , in which a complete ab@@ z@@ ym@@ atic gel already manifested in the newborn child ( within the first 28 years of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac shape ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephalopath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty distur@@ ban@@ ces AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in granite form .
daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ iel@@ ding : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² each day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ au@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack of ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² each day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a is when the tablets occur not immediately in the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with contra@@ sting heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ lation as well as with so@@ dium and pe@@ dic@@ ular clinical trials only with caution .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate takes place over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore consistent ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal er@@ ural and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be observed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate re@@ tired with people in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason is the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the st@@ agnation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least one und@@ es@@ irable event ( AU ) on and at 78 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ LA .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ normal patient who developed a metabo@@ lic encephalopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too , Gra@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery of neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old small child with a ver@@ itable individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limitation of ne@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection characterized by acet@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is re@@ tired about the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections include 2 nitrogen at@@ ome ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract may be assumed that for every gram@@ mar so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ feste form of the disease coinci@@ ded with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn baby was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease conducted itself in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ ering @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first quarter of life .
through ha@@ vo@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ als ( nat@@ ri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ate K@@ ost and potentially sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first CV ) , diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephalopath@@ y was the survival rates 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac shape of the condition ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ an trans @-@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ a@@ eg@@ ro@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet , the survival rates was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may cause further deterioration of neurological condition .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ iel@@ ding to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed , which is arranged in liver and kidney @-@ enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ism in plasma and urine were determined by offering a single dose of 5 grams of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ema and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical st@@ rolls ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after se@@ eded fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeatedly treated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / Day oral in three single doses ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ berries on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts .
curing The medication is re@@ tired within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ red product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and not toxic cans treated R@@ atten no k@@ war@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after or@@ derly administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who have not swal@@ low tablets or patients with difficulty distur@@ ban@@ ces ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ff or a no@@ stri@@ de .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ iel@@ ding : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² each day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ector in the plasma should be kept inside the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ au@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ule contains 124 mg per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed before the birth Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the fantasy .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ normal patient who developed a metabo@@ lic encephalopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too , Gra@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery of neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections include 2 nitrogen at@@ ome ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract may be assumed that for every gram@@ mar so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients may cause further deterioration of neurological condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were established 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can preserve the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
with this approach , the small measuring spo@@ on is 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on of 8,@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts until 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases they lack specific liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the suff@@ oc@@ ular waste products that may accum@@ ulate according to the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as Nat@@ ri@@ f@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken care of , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the l@@ ac@@ tation you can not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could move into the breast milk and your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , sav@@ ors , dis@@ appearance , sei@@ z@@ iness , sei@@ z@@ iness , and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istical states were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency treatment of your hospital in order to constitute an appropriate treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have substantially affected or you notice side effects that are not specified in this usage information .
you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS after that on the box and the containers may not use anymore up to the stated exp@@ ir@@ ation date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and content of the AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape and they are equipped with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If there are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as Nat@@ ri@@ f@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken care of , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS in the same retailer ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly in the stomach ) respectively a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is managed by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • take out from the container a ge@@ ous measurement of gran@@ ules . • St@@ rich you a straight edge , e.g. a knife on the edge of the measuring table to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The recommended number of brass spo@@ ons like gran@@ ulate from the vessel .
An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ istic ag@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arkt ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement on the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
det@@ ox for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients suffering from one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at some fer@@ ment or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent cl@@ ots ) with the conventional comp@@ elling treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
during the PCI the patient was often a St@@ ent ( a short redness , which remains in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a clas@@ p ) and they additionally got other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for heavy ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ et@@ ahs .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a disease , as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or yeast infection .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a removable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd will receive a licence for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency access or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ ald@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in the patient , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg and in@@ fusion should be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI need to be back to clinical requirements the reduced intake dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt from 0,5 mg / kg shall be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) shortened from 225 seconds , a second bolt from 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before applying the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion is administered correctly .
for patients with moderate kidney @-@ functional ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is located below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administered of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ dness is again examined .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , included in phase II , the ACT value lay 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox @-@ tra@@ indi@@ cted ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be introduced 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous issue of un@@ question@@ able He@@ aler or 8 hours following the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous sl@@ ings of low @-@ molecular sl@@ ings .
• well known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or other constitu@@ ents or increases blood risks due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the h@@ mo@@ z@@ es@@ ystems and / or irrever@@ sible bar@@ codes ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood circulation , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ad , most of the ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial point points can occur in patients who undergo a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle occur all ble@@ eding .
in patients who are dealt with war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ der ( International norm@@ ised Ratio ) in order to ensure that the value is reached with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in once again prior to the treatment .
from the knowledge of the efficacy mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , t@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or thro@@ mb@@ z@@ zy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood vessels .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ rom@@ atic aggreg@@ ation@@ ists or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters can be checked regular in any case .
the animal @-@ experimental studies are inadequate in terms of effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the band@@ aging or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either in@@ frac@@ tional He@@ aler or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ inhibit@@ or .
in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the comparative groups , it was more frequently used in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .

ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , juven@@ iles and children over six years with diabetes , who need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , or is administered as a continuous fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regulate the Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood , or the ins@@ ulin is not effective .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very different from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter active duration than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce in@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 @-@ diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin has not been effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was to change the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates , how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with type @-@ 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was determined after six months ( by 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % for the normal normal normal ins@@ ulin .
ap@@ id@@ ra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra must possibly be customized when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ shed of kos@@ her .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the marketing of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
ap@@ id@@ ra is as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ector either to apply in the area of abdom@@ en , surface or del@@ ta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal body .
due to the reduced glu@@ c@@ eo@@ genesis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin is required in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of the substance , the brand ( Her@@ - actors ) , the ins@@ ulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ sive diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic crop . these conditions are potentially potentially deadly .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the efficacy profile of the used ins@@ ulin , and can therefore change from the switch of the treatment schema .
among the substances , which increase the blood @-@ cker@@ le activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fi@@ bro@@ c@@ ram@@ id , fi@@ ref@@ uses , mon@@ o@@ amin oxid@@ ation ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ oxi@@ di@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ isi@@ an antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pine the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ gen bac@@ kl@@ as have been weak@@ ened or absent .
animal experimental studies on re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ism showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin delivery occurs into the human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin does not enter into the breast milk , nor becomes res@@ or@@ ated after oral application .
below are the drugs known from clinical studies ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 10 ; frequently : ≥ 1 / 10 ; frequently : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare ( frequency on the basis of the availability data is un@@ solved ) .

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with awareness can be treated with in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an accordingly trained person , or by a intraven@@ ous gift of glu@@ c@@ ose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ agon@@ in@@ je@@ op@@ tion , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to as@@ cer@@ tained the Ur@@ - thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar level through the stimulation of the periph@@ eral body intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ c@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ a@@ es of ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ ting us ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate share of the glu@@ c@@ ant effect , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as rapid integration , such as norm@@ ative Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and achieves the complete fi@@ est@@ al impact of about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was obvious that in an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes prior to the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with the normal normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
became ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous control as with the normal normal ins@@ ulin , which has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
becomes ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the meal - wast@@ ed a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like in the normal normal normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ tig@@ ators in front of the meal ( see picture 1 ) .
