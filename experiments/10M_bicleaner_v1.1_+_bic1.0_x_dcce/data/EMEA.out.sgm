<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Law (EPAR) which is explained how the research committee has been judged to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package fee (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt (tablets that apply in the mouth), as a solution to disposable (1 mg / ml) and as an injection resolution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wires thought and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and insanity; • Bibi-I-disorder, a psychological disease, in which the patients manage many periods (periods of abnormal high-tune) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe severe severe severe severe episodes and in the prevention of Manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is used for rapid control of gestant anxiety or behavioral disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases the solution can be used or the melting in patients may be applied in patients where the swallowing of tablets difficulties are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemicals that enable communication of neurons to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripivzol probably appears above all as a "partial agonists" for the receptors for neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripivzol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neurotransmitter is working to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptus in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripidazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms, and their reinvitations will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the reemergence of the symptoms, was investigated in three studies over by one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting redemption has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which are compared to a mental anxiety, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent the revenge to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that led to gestured unrest, using the Lorazepon (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">For all studies the change in symptoms experienced by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients examined for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led out studies in analysing how the body detects the melting tables and the solution to invitations (adopts).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting resolution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of plagued trouble than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies of more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify turned up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo indential episodes in previously treated patients and if it was also administered into an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of plagued anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrollably), weakening, nausea (nausea), shelter, nausea (nausea), shelter, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomed( sleepiness) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Resource Technology (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from severe to severe manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the many episodes in dealing with Aripivzol spoke to predominate the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the outcome, that the advantages of injecting solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in case of bias-I-disturbance if a oral therapy is not suited to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bias-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripivzol languages (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bivouac disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Indutor is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripivzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the start or change an antipsychotic therapy, also in treating Aripivzol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder has no elevated suicide risk with Aripivzol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripivzol should predispose of patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardiac arrests, cardiac disease, disorders that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloody drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripivzol framed Dyskiniiesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a spleyskiniesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a mns, or inclear high fever, without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripivzol should be used in patients with variculture in the anamnese or in states that are linked with varicils.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripivzol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients, which were treated with Aripivzol, a heightened mortality compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with Fixer Dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the contacting of unwanted runtrovascularial events with Aripivzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoaziosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, has been reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drug, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk estimates for Hyperglycaemia-related incidents in with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to be treated patients, the direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored on a regular basis regarding worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Manie because of using antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side-effect and could lead to severe complications and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripivzol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripivzol in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines will be taken with overageing side effects such as Sedierung (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist of Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorpation rate of Aripivzol, however this effect is not as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy regulators, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidin) the AUC of Aripivzol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors from CYP2D6 like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6'bad '(= "poor") Metabolisians can result in common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripivzol compared to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">When you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, like Itraconazole and HIV-Protect inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After deformation of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dosage ranges from the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripivam concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripivzol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Own prazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripivae.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data base for safety while men and due to the concerns caused by the animal studies in pregnancy, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible use justifies clear the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including vehicles, to use until they are safe that Aripivzol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than on placebo or were classified as potential health-related effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients suffering with Aripivzol, a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathovo, Dystonie and Dyskinides, compared with patients who were treated with semi-opidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripivzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients suffering with Aripivzol were treated, and 15,1% in patients under the loss therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in BiaI-disturbance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripitizol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripivzol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripivage treatment and 15,7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripivzol and placebo in which potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivzol treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Regarding the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroletic syndrome, Spätdyskiesis and varicualties, unwanted wounded events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the launch were unintentional or intentional overdose with Aripivzol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a herbatization in the treatment of overdose with Aripivzol; it is unlikely, however, that havosis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is, as Aripidazole has a high plastic maple.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripivzol in schizophrenia and bihi-disturbance on the combination of a partial agonal effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripivzol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7- to alpha-1-adrengen and to Histamine-H1Receiver.</seg>
<seg id="76">With Gabe von Aripivzol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy probanden showed the Positlemons Emissions tomy, a D2 / D3 receptors Ligurian, at the Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripivzol showed a statistically significant increase in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Halopidol-controlled trial was presented in week 52 the proportion of responsive patients who held a response to study medicine, in both groups (Aripivzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from the measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study points, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depressants scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was at 34% in the Aripivzol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a lacklapin controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of minimum 5 kg at an average weight of approx. 6,6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing about 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bibi-I-disorder showed Aripivzol, compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with Fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bibi-I-disorder showed Aripivzol compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripivzol showed a compared to placebo invariably effectiveness in week 3 and a reduction effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi-operidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripivzol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with the symptomatic remission of the Manie on like lithium or semi-opidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks do not match to lithium or Valproat monotherapy with Aripidazole a superior effectiveness at reducing problems compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in the treatment phase, Aripivzol showed a remission to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar reversing, predominantly in the prevention of a reversal attack in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxymodelling of Aripivzol, the N-Dealkyization is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripivzol with extensive Metabolism on CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripivzol, there are no differences in the pharmaceutical ininetic between male and female healthy probanden, as well as a pharmacotic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A-specific evaluation for Pharmaceuticals yielinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin, or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Aripivae.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Aripivzol and Dehydro-Aripivzol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy probanden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with a different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmaceuticals function of Aripivzol and Dehydro-Aripivzol, but the study embraced only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety vology, toxicity in repeatability, reproductionariicity, Genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, the preclinical data left no special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxiological significative effects have only been observed in doses or exposing, which significantly exceeds the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only limited for the clinical use only limited or no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a doso-dependent adrenal gland (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchydischarge of oxins at 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended maxady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maxaldboard State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis (AUC).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis has been established as a result of the falsile of sulphylbenzene in Galle from monkeys to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81stamping of the recommended maxalddose with man based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of HydroxyLjugate of hydroxy- Aripivein no more than 6% of the concentrations that were noted in the study about 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far under the limits (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosing, which led to Expositions of the 3 and 11ms of the middle Steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximize dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of overreceived actions is calculated based on a definite event in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and it was not established as a significant connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-anti-crotubules, which promotes the assembling of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilized the microtubules by imitation of their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulary network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albummerges has been conveyed by plasma components in the cell cells and in the context of vitro studies has been proven that the presence of paclitaxel promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelin cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved trance-pelal transport is conveyed by the gp-60-album's receptor and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (tted PEacidic Rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of abraxane for metastatic Mammacarcinoma is supported by 106 patients in two unambiguous dential studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients treated with metastatic Mammacarcinoma with abrasion, which was given in the form of an infusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma who received all 3 weeks a monotherapy with Paclitaxel, either in the form of solvent-based chemotherapy (N = 225) or in the form of abrasion 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">With the inclusion in the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>

<seg id="312">9 The results for the general contact rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients suffering from first-line therapy are set below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree of patients working at a time during therapy a peripheral neuropathy degree 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to the end on baseline because of cumulative toxicity of abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and continues to be unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacoposyinetics of the overall Paclitaxel to 30- and 180-minute Infusions of abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous gift of abrasion to patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma-concentration took up a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a wide-ranging extravagance distribution and / or ordination of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacolic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2, with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after an solvent-based Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human microalgae and tissue, reports will be reported that Paclitaxel is primarily used to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and with two smaller Metabolism (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel) and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2, the mean value for cumulative urinary tract of the unaltered active dose of 4% of the given total dose, with less than 1% of the metabolism, 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing centre.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, about patients aged over 75 years, however, only a few data are available, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacotic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that seamed a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and holds the same substance (also called "Reference for drugs").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which in connection with bloodtransfusion complications may occur if before the intervention is a self-blood circulation, and in which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1500 ml.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abolamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician, who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood-donate is seamed in a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injections may also be made by the patient or the supervisor if they have received proper guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney insufflation or in patients suffering from chemotherapy, the hooks should always be at the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per decagite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl with children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron bar exists, and iron complexiers should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who get an chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, a anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietinmangel or thereby that the body does not abandon the body's body erythropoiantin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoitin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell, into which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection in a Vene in the context of a main study with 479 patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused anemia, with the reference rate of reference.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either samed on seamed or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicators for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobequities between the beginning of the study and the end period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin of speculation-tamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined at 114 cancer patients infected with chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused anemia, the hemoglobes of patients were converted to seamed to the same extent as those with those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients received further Eprex / Erypo received an increase from 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of Abdullah is a rise in blood pressure, which occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) like sudden, steer-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are needed to ensure that herein may be triggered by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) came to conclude that for Abseamed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of the certificate, the medicine has been a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">The symptoms and symptoms of interest can vary depending on age, gender and overall disease, so assessing the individual clinical trial and disease state is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in the hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) for a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hitting Bells above or under hemoglobin- Tarkonzentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this tick-globinability should be tried using an appropriate dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobule is worth more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or when the permanent hemline gloex is worth 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be fully monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is required in the lowest possible dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The actual clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low HB value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) could possibly require more maintenance than patients, in which the initial anemia is less heavy (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The actual clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low HB value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) could possibly require higher yields than patients, in which the initial anemia is less heavy (HB &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Law (EPAR) which is explained how the research committee has been judged to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type-2-diabetes (also known as non-insulin diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which Metformin (a Diabetric drug) is not shown together with another divergence medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin for patients (in particular overweight patients), which can be adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharnac or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylharnac or insulin, can be kept as well as in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulfonisharnescent or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-specific insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar has to decrease, thus allowing to be better set of type 2-diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; in this case, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylharp, in addition they received either an account or placebo for up to 3,5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c), which indicates, how well the blood sugar has been adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in HbA1c-value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels could be lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg used.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl harp in a reduction of hbA1c values around 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who participated in addition to insulin, lowering the hbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and mortgage (diminished sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who might insensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver issues, heart insufficiency or diabetic cacacian (high ketone mirror - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (for all use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin for patients should serve in which Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 shared the European Commission of Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited, approved by Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, domed and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the magazine "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate to insulin, where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier cardiac arrests or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of infection, weight gain or furnaces, especially those with reduced cardiopal reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of infection, weight gain and furnaces, when Pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovasculariate outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular illness was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on cardiac insufficiency showed what does not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output modules (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normalisation) or with other signs of a liver illness, Pioglitazone should not be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased by the 3-bit of the upper limit of the normality, the liver enzymyness is as soon as possible to control again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient developed symptoms, which refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overhead, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or darker Harn, the liver values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazon, should be guided to the fore-out of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a doso-dependent weight gain has been proven that can comprise of fatty deposits, and in some cases associated with a fluid time.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a series of hooks, under the therapy with Pioglitazone, a lesser reduction in the middle chamber surface (relative reduction to 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction to 4.3%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparison with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin um 3-4%) and to a lower extent even in patients under sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin um 1-2%, and hamatocation by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulinsensitivity to patients, the pioglitazone as oral branches or triple combination therapy with a sulphyl therapy with insulin, the risk of doso-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch was reported among the treatment of Thiazolidindions, including pioglitazon, over a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic macular disease with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of Makulaops who should be aware of the possibility of a Makulaödems when patients report about interference of visual acuity, a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports undesirable events in randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 questionnaires per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for examining cardiovasculental events, fractures from 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and in case a patient desire an pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is abatting (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenoboumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium-canalblocker and HMGCoA-reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Ininhibitor) resulting in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon um the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Indutor) resulting in a lowering of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazon which diminished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the breast reduction and thus reduce the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (this data will not be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and break-indexes of the lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazas, ALT Anstiege entered into the triple of the upper limit of the standard area frequently on like placebo, but less frequent than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macular illness, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was raised by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazone was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports undesirable events were randomised from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients included in the groups treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative patients.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years current proactive study, fractures from 44 / 870 (5,1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2,5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="797">For taking the maximum dosage of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work via a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator Accurator g)) that leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, obesity and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduced the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosevert in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as Monotherapy was continued for two years to investigate the time up to the revival of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, a blood sugar control has been defined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients to be maintained (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In an placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three imonatiger optimizing phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under the Pioglitazone, the average HbA1c reduced itself around 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to received only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, under the Pioglitazone showed an statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotistic compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 weeks and examined by type 2-2 ditics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the overall plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide, the total plastic-glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under the Pioglitazone no statistical significant increase in the LDL cholesterol level has been established, while under metformin and gliclazide diminished values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride but also improved in addition the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both via an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovasculinary Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular illness in groups randomized, which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazone is quickly resorted, whereby the peak concentrations in unaltered pioglitazone usually reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is based on effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, while the relative effectiveness of M-II minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies it could be proven that Pioglitazone does not affect the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenoboumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Ininhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Indutor) and lowers the plasma concentration from Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive spinitazone in the human being, the marker was mainly found in the thread (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma Elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to the people 5-6 hours, and throughout the entire active metof metabolism, is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy probands, whereby the rates of the orinal Clearance of the mother-constancy is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and ape, according to repetitive administration, plasma-magnification with hooks, anaemia and reversible cardiac hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under the treatment with pioglitazon which diminished in the Gestation of the Hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance to the breast reduction and thus reduce the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induces in the rat-rise by hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the homologous polyposis (FAP), the treatment led with two other ThiazolidIndions increased to an increased frequency of collagen.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 questionnaires per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for examining cardiovasculental events, fractures from 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year more than Pioglitazone showed an statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotistic compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the sober triglyceride but improved in addition the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on an effect on the tryceride absorption as well as on the hepatic Trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacked the target with regard to its primary final point, which resulted in a combination of the totality, non-deadly lawns, stroke, coronation and revascularization of the leg arteries, place the results associated with the intake of pioglitazon no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injecting needle must be harassed at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved considerably, for example, through a intensified inulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia warning-symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin, long-acting insulin, long-acting inulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, humaninsulin or insulin delivery) can cause that a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of change to Actraphane when a dosage adjustment is required, this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, in which hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Travel that go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his doctor, as such travels may lead to insulin and meals at other times or must be taken.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult its patients after other drugs.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycaemia that can occur in any sufficiently controlled diabetric therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycaemias can lead to consciousness and / or crampant cases and end with temporary or lasting disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peripheral neuropathy as a rapid improvement of the blood sugar control can be associated with complaints, which are commonly referred to as acute-known neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>

<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints on appointment occasionally - Local hypersensitivity reaction to injecting location during the insulin therapy can occur local overreceived actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haemom in the injecting location).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system occasionally - Urtikaria, Exanthem very rare - anaphylactic reactions of generalizations, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotish oils, fierce, low blood pressure and impotence / consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can however develop in stages: • Glue Morglycaemias can be handled by the orale supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have trauma pieces, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice in itself. • Heavy hypoglycemic acid with consciousness are treated with a intra-muscular or subcutaneous injecting of Glucagon or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the activity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorpation profile lays in it because the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>

<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane flowed bottle was removed from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C), before it is used under the manual for the first use resuspended.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, in which hypoglycaemic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplendorsion or to an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overrivalence.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; realizations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tightening control of an experienced physician in the transplant physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In consequence of an conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function since the renal function does not affect the pharmaceuticals of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxical potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serotonin levels, a calculation of creatinence and an monitoring of the urinary tract) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies allow to conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the mirror mirror can not exceed in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the bottom mirror of Tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplants usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in renal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent eradication of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients were usually used in blood-concentration in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including transplanting and other side effects that may occur in a result of Tacrolimus Underground or Exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; realizations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the tightening control of an experienced physician in the transplant physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first use of the data, the CHMP has continued to be considered positive, but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Thus, the CHMP is based on the safety profils of ADVATE, which makes an filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that regulatory authorities should apply for 5 years for further procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited with the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) officially approved that the company recovers his application for approval by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the pasture (tissues that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and supports).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that genetically modified, that it can carry out a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "adenovirus" that has changed so that there cannot be copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advent should have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the not defective in the human body of existing p53 gene, bears usually the restoration of corrupt DNA and kill the cells if the DNA could not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is faulty, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient before the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of construction, into the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP tested the answers of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial submitted documents the CHMP documents a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP opinion has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexis in Li-Fraumeni Tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company was not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participating in clinical studies or "compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen of the nose-way) in patients with nasal mucosity (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aerinaze is to be taken twice a day, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (petoped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be implated on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main contributors were the changes in the severity of the hypocriss ymptomome that were reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients took their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When evaluating all the hypocrative ympic symptoms, besides the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze, reported via a decrease in the symptoms around 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in the patients, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed a relief of symptoms around 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarmen (coronation), distiphic hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomedence (sleeplessness), somnia, and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other constituents, against adequate medicines or Loratadine (a different drug for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>

<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemic breaks out when a new strain of the Grippeek emerges, which can easily spread from man to person, because human beings still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine the immune system recognises the parts of the anti-peek-virus as "body-foreign" and constitutes antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system later is able to form in contact with a crippeek-virus of this pedims fast antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus by the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as body-foreign) split up and used as an element of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the extent of clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine will not be taken to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA (MEA) guidelines for prehistoric vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor's care physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are associated with the humanic immunodeficiency virus from type 1 (HIV-1) which are caused by the acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, it's not available as a solution for entry, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be ordered when the doctor has checked, which antiviral medicines has previously been taken, and the likelihood has assessed that the virus will address the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ronavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four to twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Amgenerase reduces with intake in combination with other antiviral medicines that keeps HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, however, can delay the immune system's immune system and thus also delay the development of AIDS associated infections and ailments.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other anti-viral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, previously had not been treated with Protests.</seg>
<seg id="1912">That with low dosire Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, formerly proteasers formerly compared with other proteasers.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-white concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in Viruslast after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously been not a protocate previously, after 48 weeks, more patients had a Viruslast among 400 copies / ml than below placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase was also the Viruslast, however with the children who had previously been treated with Proteasants, very few of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which had previously been treated with Protests, that has been treated with Ritonavir medicine Agenerase the Viruslast after 16-week treatment as well as other Proteasers:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients suffering from HIV, which was resistent against four other proteins, it came under Agenerase with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of Viruslast after four weeks as in the patients who continued up their previous prototype:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Ageneric (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 asgenerase may not be used in patients which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amalgam or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients suffering or herbal (herbal supplement for treating depression) or drugs which are just like asgenerase and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the ageneric acid (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoneky (declining of bone tissue) or an immune response syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system's immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Genetics (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of asgenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years facing the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacocinetic resoavir, but the committee set firmly that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously had not been a protector.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances" since the approval was limited for scientific reasons for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 distributed the European Commission to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the marketing of the general public in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, protector (PI) treated for adults and children older than 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are intended to be administered for pharmacocinetic Boothavir, along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance cord and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ambavir as a solution to income is by 14% lower than of amplavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solutions are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for ageneric capsules is 600 mg amranavir twice daily along with 100 mg konavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting) must be applied, higher doses must be applied to asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for ageneric capsules is 20 mg aminavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amnesty which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protein bugs have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for children under 4 years of age, due to the failure of data for uncertainties and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder, it is contraindications (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase can not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic range and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements, contain currants (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amranavir during the intake of ampluses (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Ageneric or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asgenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Typically, Ageneric capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti-retroviral combination therapy, have increased risk for serious liver interactions with potentially deadly disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous anti-viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis also show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glukokortikoids, which switches over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment is excessive using the risk of systemic cornuiscopider effects including Morbus Csore and supplementation of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the fuel-changing of HMG CoA-reducer Lovastatin and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies, including Rhabdomyolsen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International normised Ratio), methods are available for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Ageneric can be less effective due to reduced plasma bricks of amplavir less effective (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amdiavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be changed, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given simultaneously with Amdiavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatdeficiency symptoms, especially if they are also underminuted even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high promenglycol in the Ageneric solution to income, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set on a permanent basis, if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protesters, has been reported by the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, Hyperglycaemia or an exastical circle of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, whose therapy medications were necessary to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, associated with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Premophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with Proteasants, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous compoons and hemosteoarthritis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with heavy immune defective, at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) developed an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunology, higher Body Mass Mass), were reported cases of Osteonekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase can not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic range and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given along with medicinal drugs, whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are connected for the increased plastic bars with heavy and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin a 82% reduction of the AUC of amplavir causes which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the reduced plasma-levels through a dosage increase of other protein-inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were observed very frequently unwanted effects in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskwort (Hypericum perforatum) The Serving levels of aminavir can be brought by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskine( hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient is already induced antiquity, the ampluses blood levels and, if possible to check the Viruslast and reduce the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for any of the drugs is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amdiavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax on the other hand over 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with amplavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amavir has been applied twice daily and konavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this treatment rental.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% low when Amber avir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir was administered twice per day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amplavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of amplavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Knights (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg konavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of amalgavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, there is not a tightly monitoring, because the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacocinetic study conducted in combination with didanosene, however, due to the violating component of didanosin is recommended that the income of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amaviavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) do not require a dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amaviavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, since the exposure of both protocation ehemently would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other proteasers and existing limited data suggests that Neviral in the servitude of amalgam could possibly senct.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, caution because Delavirdin will be less effective because of the decreased or maybe subtherapeutic plastic bars could be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amplavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ambavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin around 193% and thus to an increase in rifabutin side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If for clinical reasons, rifabutin is required to administer rifabutin, to a reduction in dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical studies with agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma-bar of both medicines could be raised in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosampouazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below including substrates, Hemmer or Indutors from CYP3A4, if they are applied together with asgenerase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions, which are associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that Antazida may not be taken at the same time as ashes as it may come to resorpulation.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulants, known as an enzymindutors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amranavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma seal of amplavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium petals such as Amlodipin, stymodipine, Isradipin, Nifeasipin, Nifeasipin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin, Nifidipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amalgamavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with asgenerase can considerably increase their plastic concentrations and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors in connection-side effects including hypotage, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to probanden have been significantly higher, while the endogenous Kortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% -depth interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous Ggenerality of Agenerase with Ritoravir is not recommended together with these glucokortikoids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment is excessive using the risk of systemic cormortal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA-Sinjase inhibitors like Lovastatin and simvastatin, their metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced enhancements of the plasma-bars with simultaneous administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because Plasmaspile increases of these HMG CoA-reduction inhibitors to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with amdiavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabilisation of the mirror, as the plasma concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous casting of amalgam (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, aspiration cannot be applied together with oral cubic midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous application of asgenerase with parentalem Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultanious application of parenteral Midazolam with other protein inhibitors point to a possible increase in the plastic bar of Midazolam in order to fold up to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amdiavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatdeficiency symptoms, especially if they are also underminuted even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the due to low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as the amranavir- dose to adapt when Ambelavir is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Concurrent gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase is recommended an increased control of INR (International NormalRatio) because of the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of anti-throtic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not presetable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in concurrent gift of asgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medication may only be used for pregnancy just after careful execution of possible utility for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated rerats were detected amranavir-related substances, but it is not known whether amplavir passes on people into mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A Reproduction study to fruity penumers that was administered by the disarmament in the uterus until the end of the stagnation time of Aminavir during the lactation period showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight at night.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including fertilization and reproduction was not impaired by the administration of amalgamavir to the dams.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The imminality of asgenerase was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were easy to moderate, occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarified whether they are related to the prevention of asgenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protector had not previously received patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were promoted by the test doctors as in connection with the study medication and were performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral agent therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV sufferers, including a loss of peripheral and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophia and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophia of breasts and dorsobral fat collection (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113-retrofully untreated persons who were treated with Amdiavir in combination with Lamivudi in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin for a mid-scale period of 36 weeks, only one case has been observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 the patients treated under Amdiavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%), in combination with various NGOs about a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually easy to moderate, erythemed or makued paper with or without itch and occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without having to dismiss the treatment with amranavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV-infected patients with heavy immune defective, at the time the introduction of an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously described patients, the 600 mg Agenerase were observed twice daily along with low dosiavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and CPK values, which received in patients who were asgenerase, along with low dosire Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is on an indication of an instoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amplavir binds to the active center of HIV-1-protease and thereby prevents the process of viral viral and gag-pol- polyproteinate levels with the result of a formation of non-infectious virus particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of amplavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in both acutely and chronically infected devices (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) and peripheral bloodhocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amplavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of ambavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretrofit patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages were - like with other ritonavir boophemed treatment schemas with protesters inhibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">With sixteen of 434 antiretrofit patients, the 700mg Fosampoutreavir received with 100mg konavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virologic 'say up to week 48, where 14 isolation could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the insulators of 13 of 14 children, in which a virologistic failure had not joined forces within the 59, showed resistance patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) participated in patients with virologistic failure over 96 weeks, the following protocation-mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">On genotypic resistance measurement systems, analysing the activity of amplavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir can be applied in patients with protein-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-11-11-algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147A / L, I84A / L / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a crashed phenomenal resistance and a reduced probability of a virological contact (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data and it is recommended to always move the current interpretations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In a phenomenal resistance of pesticides in connection with the genotypic analyses of interpreting the activity of ammuniavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that can distribute the diagnostic resistance tests, have developed clinically-phenomenal Cut-offs (partition points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amaviavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain crusence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistence between ammuniavir and other protesters for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance trails, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2033">The other way round, Ambelavir retains its activity against some other protein-resistant insulators; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the insulator.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early cancellation of a versing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a large number of mutations in limits that may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the effectiveness of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial (NRO) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with an PI, primarily with a lower tape, duonavir ', received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One-hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least an NGO were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-underproof of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the NC-PI-Group in terms of time-saving (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-undergrowth threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of rugeboosterilase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>

<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed on a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amplavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of ruined ampluses which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn ampluses remains constant, fluctuates the percentage of free active component during the dosage assistance in the Steady State control over the range from Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly investigating the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect in terms of reducing the GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five years, Aldurazyme die of GAG concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children passed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, mental pain, rash, skin pain, pain-pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of pulmonary function), tachycardiovascular (accelerated heart rate), fever and shook.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not respond to patients who may be severe (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Drug Agency (EMEA) will review any new information every year that may be known to examine and update this summary as required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of aldurazyme is maintained patients who receive aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the Genzyme Europe B.V. in approval for the marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-cellular cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstve of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is used for long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of mukopolysaccharides I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase fault) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximize dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insuffix has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion conditioned reactions which are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or by the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of aldurazyme should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment, to be immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, the fact that nearly all patients of Igor antibodies against Laronidase are usually formed, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity to be cautious after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyretics) to minimise the potential appearance of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be included with a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and Parisprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the pre-equated reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or Proccaine because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidase consists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data to newborns that have been exponential compared to Laronidase over the breast milk, it is recommended to not satisfy during the treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical trials were derived mainly as infusion conditioned reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in phase 3-3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted remedies in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the pre-history, there have been severe reactions to, including Bronchospic, respiratory resistance and faciards (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children of unwanted drugs in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phas- 2-study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with mainly heavy displace size and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age with a heavy circulation system (on average after 26 days after 45 days with patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3-3 study (or up to a premature output from the study) were submitted in 13 / 45 patients no by radioimmunointagitation (RIP) assay verifiable antibodies before, including 3 patients, in which there was never too seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with mislead levels led to a robust reduction of GAG reflector in the harn, while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal inhibitory effects on enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to not impair the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse health agents, even though the occurrence of undesirable pharmaceutical agents typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the acute substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of acceptable restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-Phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients was caught up by the Middle phenotype and only a patient pointed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forciated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute enclosure in the 6-minute- obedience.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label study study, where they received further 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the obedience shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed up in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of the FEV is not clinically significant over this period of time and the total volume of the total volume increases constantly proportional to the body size.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with hephalegaly performed in front of treatment 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal life size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear drop of GAG mirrors was fixed at the Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the degree of study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to heterogeneous pathogens between patients who have been taken into account by using a combined final point, the clinically significant alterations in the age of 5 patients (58%), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%), no change in 10 patients (20%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It has been conducted a one-year open phase 2 study, in which mainly the security and Pharmaceuticals in 20 patients were examined, which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years old (16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with the middle age form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage increased by increased GAGC levels in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Several patients were a size growth (s = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) has been fixed after the Z-score for this age group (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle vertical form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle vertical form (&lt; 2,5 years), whereas in the elderly patients were detained in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, research on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme-metering schemata were performed on the GAG mirror in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The metering scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a reasonable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two doses of these two doses is equal.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacoinetic profile for patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and reproductionists, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient the bond of chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alois was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapies were received, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies that have been treated strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values at 63% for Alois (119 by 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission shared the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the launch of Alois in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicted: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severe emetogenic chemotherapy based on cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting into moderate-etoed chemotherapy based on cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi is inducing in the prevention of nausea and vomiting, inducing by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding any given by the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the dickhead patients, patients should be monitored with anamnesting obstipation or signs of a subconscious Ileus after injection moulding machine.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable when using Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to extend such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemical therapeutical gift, Alois should not be used in the days following chemotherapy to treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron considered against tumors oriented activity of the five examined chemical therapeutics. (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphate, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial did not prove a significant pharmacotic interplay between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady stature concentration, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacotic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Dattendeine, caxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Parxorubicin, Fluoxetine, kanitidin, kanitidin, kicordin, kicorgy, Sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences to the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore, Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is necessary by the treating doctor than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials were the most common among a dose of 250 micrograms for monitoring side effects (a total of 633 patients), which were in connection with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of overreceived actions and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were published in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies were reported by undesirable events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies conducted, due to the large number of distribution, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy in a aloxide overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients, which received an ocre-etogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 clicorubicin and 250 mg / m2 dxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 (half-value 3 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-value 7.3 hours), which was given to day 1 without dexethasason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study total of 667 patients, who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycloarbazine, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared that were 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to intravenous in 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etoed chemotherapy and the study with strong emetoed chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-inducing nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron was similar to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinonosetron, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic and repolarization involved in the ventriescanals and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.V. administered Palonosetron in retailers of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows the initialization of plasma concentration, a slow elimination of the body with an average rating time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface at the concentrations time curve (AUC0-) are generally located throughout the entire dosage range of 0.3 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancers dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacocinetic simulations suggests that the total exposure of €0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure (AUC0-) with the value of 0.75 mg total value; however, the Cmax after penetration of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolism that have compared to Palonosetron about less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, the Isoencme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 has been involved in abolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron reported approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous case for healthy blood the total physical value of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing period 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver disorder the terminale Elimination deflection and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, a reduction of dosage is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only by positions that are considered sufficiently above the maximum humanistic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies were evidence that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ionic canals, who are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can extend the potential for action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose has been given in about the 30s of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given every day over two years led to an increased frequency of liver beekeepers (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenmark) and skin lesions on rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses of the high doses and since Alois destined for a unique application, the relevance of these results are diminished than for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The authorization of this approval must be provided by the European Commission on the plans for the marketing of the pharmaceutical drug as part of this decision in the scope of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, recommended for the approval of the medication provided to the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon of a biological medicine called Roferon-A similar to the same practitioner is similar to that already in the EU (also called "Reference for drugs").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-standing) hepatitis C (one by an viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue shows damage, in addition the values of the liver enzyme Alanyransferase (ALT) also increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon made data that is the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, efficacy, safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of the Reference case study was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been thoroughly expressed that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug market.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients infected with hepatitis C, which focused on treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was re-taught in more patients than at the reference rate; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, the test carried out in the study to determine the extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) dissolves, not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetitions (one with crude formation of incoming skin infection) and small infected inths (crack or snapshots), abrasions and paralysis wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which were neglected or presumably caused by methicillinresistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because algo against this type of infections may not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient fails to approach the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosom (the parts of the bacterial, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cloned after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.3%) of 71 patients among placebo were talking on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected animals, Altargo and Cefalexin has reported similar response: if the results of both studies have been taken on hand-depth, about 90% of the patients of both groups on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was found in the treatment of downside (eitered hollow in the physique) or of infections, which were verifiable or presumably caused by MRSA is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the plant.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections. • Impetigo, • incomparatively small laerations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transfer of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, in which two to three days do not show improvement, should be investigated once and be considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin gene, the treatment is designed to carefully scrupulsing the balance and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies on secondary wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin resistent sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected space will occur.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of reapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plastic concentrations that were reached with people under topical application, is a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo not to expect (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topic application of 1% Retapamulin salvault to be protected from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered required when topical reaplulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Tierstudien have shown a reproduction capacity after orderly intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the reddish / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indivisible and the use of reapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continues / terminated, is to derive the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo was used, was the most frequent re-effect irritation to the administration of which approximately 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effectiveness of reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivate from Pleuromutilin, a substance, which is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus (formerly Pleasotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The drug mechanism of reapaminsulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interacting on a specific ties of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the links of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the connecting-place protein level L3 is involved and is located in the region of the bosomal P-bindings and the Peptidyltransferasezine.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through bond to this links inhibit Pleuromutiline the PeptidylTransfer, blocking partly P-links and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomous subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be considered due to the local prevalence of the resistance to the use of reapamulin at least some infection forms, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulators were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Pact Valentine Leucocidin) will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults was charged 1% reapamulin salvature day by occlusion to intact and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% reapamulin salb twice daily for 5 days to the topic treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma tubes were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 by adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans for topic use of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 deported skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-sometimes lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP-Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Abolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in humanly liver microsomi was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, lower the participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review of conjugation and / or chromosome effects in the mouse-Lymphoma test or in cultures of human periphery-cytes, as well as in the rats-microcubes to in-vivo-investigation chromosome effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither with male nor female signs of reduced fertility at oralen doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest valued exposure to humans (topic application on 200 cm2 deported skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryo study by rats were determined at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), Development stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillations) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The authorization of the approval must ensure a pharmacovigilance system, as is present in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorization for domestic transport commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance in detail as they are described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "guidelines on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treatable place, you should stop using altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not turn any other salts, creams or lotions on the surface, which is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly ordered by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the Salve looks at one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After placing the Salbe, you can cover the affected area with a sterilan association or a Gazette band, unless your doctor does not get to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccinations, with a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix must only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccines can be led to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A- or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it may arise against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine has been approved since 1996 and since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same disease, but Twinrix will be administered for adults and Twinrix children under one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are included identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a testament to the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of an protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six months and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took place between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix had similar to a six-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, appetite, pain, and the injecting, redness, matness (fatigue) as well as rivalability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is allowed in patients who may possibly be insensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) will not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission shared the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the transfer of ambitions in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardised plan for the Grundimmallization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is scheduled at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a fissant weapon is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C and anti-hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HING) antibodies in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monolitic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed up whether or less competent persons, who are addressed to a hepatitis C, as they are also no longer perceptible antibodies, as they are protected by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injecting, for the rare case, an anaphylactic reaction after the use of the vaccine will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardisation scheme with the combination of combination is recommended, the 360 ELISA-units formatted hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With haxsis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, after the Grundimmation, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hbs anti-antibody is achieved, so in these cases the gift of further vaccine may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intraoral injecting or intra-muscular administration in the vascular compromise could lead to a suboptimal vaccine success, should be avoided these injected airways.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With Thrombocytopenie or clotting disorders, Ambirix cannot be injected in such cases as it can come to intra-muscular trays in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix had served in the second quarter in the form of a separate injector, tetanus-, azellular Pertussi, inactivated carbon vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masks, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective, it must be assumed that may not be an adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducts in adults with 3 vaccines, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headache, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thiomerang and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccines have been administered in a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, tolerability of Ambirix compared to that of the 3 doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher prevalence of pain and matologists on a rating basis per vaccine Ambirix not, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the probanden, compared with 39,1% among the probanden following the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccine reported 66,4% of the probanden that had attained ambient rix, over pain, compared to 63.6% among the probanden, who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matches was comparable (that is, above the whole vaccine administered at 39,6% of the Probanden, the Ambirix got compared with 36.2% among the probes which received the 3 doses of compressor.)</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of high pain and mating was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combination of combinant with the 3-doses vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccines the appearance of localization and general interactions in the ambition group was comparable with the 3-doses of formininactivated carbon-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11am, however, after vaccination with Ambirix had a common appearance of pain (on the injecting point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that include severe side-effects during the 2-doses vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formal ininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B- commander-bearings, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted at vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Seroconverted rates for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 prepaid dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2765">The immune response given in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7) have been performed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations got either a 2-doses-vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA-units formininactivated epatitis A-virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of priming inisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies, could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction against both antigens was comparable to that, vaccinated to vaccination of 3 doses with a compressor bracket, consisting of 360 ELISA units formatted hepatitis A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- including 15-year-old could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies, 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccination, comparable to that in the 0-12-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix had existed in the second quarter at the same time with the conceptions of a combined Diphtheri-, inactivated polomyelitisan and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined masks (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mascot tuns vaccine was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined incidence of hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salhepatitis (360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis A-virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content to effective component is usually administered a month after the first dose and might give you a vaccination before termination of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix suffer from those who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disorder or treatment in your body-based dissystem, or if you / your child has been subtraced from a hereof.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases but the immune response of those individuals may not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated to separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is supposed to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be still sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has become known since issuing the first approval for the traffic traffic, the CHMP opinion that the benefit risk-relationship with Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix had only been distributed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammono can also be used for patients aged over a month using incomplete enzyme defective or with hyperammony encephalopathy (brain injury as a result of high monammoniy fixing) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammontaps - split on several single-trousers to meals - swallowed, under the food mixed or via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdomen in the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (due to the nose in the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonaps did not compare with another treatment or placebo (a hypomedication, i.e. without a substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also improve loss of loss, a abusive acidity of blood, depression, irritability, omiting, fatigue or taste, stomach pain, piting, nausea, constipation, congestion, irritation, irritation, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle to high monammoniac can be effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammontaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because due to the rarity of the illness at the time of approval, only limited information on this medicine may result in.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicted in all patients, in which a complete abzymatic gel already manifested in the newborn child (within the first 28 years of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-maniac shape (incomplete enzymdefect, which manifests itself after the first life of life) there is an indication for the use when in the anamnesis is a hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty disturbances AMMONAPS is also available in granite form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyielding: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² each day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifeste lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithinaucarbamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine osuccinatsynthetase lack of arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² each day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty disorders, as a risk for the emergence of osophagusulzera is when the tablets occur not immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with contrasting heart failure or severe kidney insufflation as well as with sodium and pedicular clinical trials only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate takes place over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore consistent (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous Gabe of phenylacetate at young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal erural and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be observed if phenylacetate retired with people in the mother's milk, and for this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the stagnation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AU) on and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not connected with AMLA.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattoo, Grazytopenie, periphery of neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdose occurred at a 5 month old small child with a veritable individual dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed at a intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimitation of neotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection characterized by acetation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is retired about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both connections include 2 nitrogen atome); phenylacetylglutamine therefore is suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary tract may be assumed that for every grammar sodium polyphenylbutyate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Prognosis of the early manifeste form of the disease coincided with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn baby was almost always infaust, and the disease conducted itself in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stickering-free analoga within the first quarter of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through havosis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excredentials (natrium phenylbutyacetate), proteinate Kost and potentially substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of newborns in postpartal (however, within the first CV), diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonic encephalopathy was the survival rates 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-maniac shape of the condition (including feminine patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornian trans-transcarbamylase-deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonaegroyrat and a proteinous diet, the survival rates was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients may cause further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyielding to Phenylacetate is oxidized, which is arranged in liver and kidney-enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism in plasma and urine were determined by offering a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyema and with liver cirrhosis as well as repetitive gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical strolls (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after seeded fasting no phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis which were repeatedly treated with Natriumphenylbutyrat (20 g / Day oral in three single doses), the middle Phenylacetate concentration in the plasmaspberries on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Curing The medication is retired within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjured product phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, Natriumphenylbutyat with toxic and not toxic cans treated Ratten no kwarogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after orderly administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who have not swallow tablets or patients with difficulty disturbances) or over a gastrostomiff or a nostride.</seg>
<seg id="2851">After previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyielding: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² each day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protector in the plasma should be kept inside the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifeste lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithinaucarbamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granule contains 124 mg per gram Natriumphenylbutyat, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattenfutes were exposed before the birth Phenylacetate (active metabolic of phenylbutyat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the fantasy.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattoo, Grazytopenie, periphery of neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both connections include 2 nitrogen atome); phenylacetylglutamine therefore is suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urinary tract may be assumed that for every grammar sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients may cause further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrat in granulatform were established 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can preserve the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this approach, the small measuring spoon is 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g Natriumphenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts until 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases they lack specific liver enzymes, so that they accumulate the suffocular waste products that may accumulate according to the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example with instabilistic agina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myokardinfarkt (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomalous measurement on the electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Detox for preventing blood clots in patients suffering from one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with Angina or cardiac to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox at some ferment or in conjunction with a glycoprotone-IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent clots) with the conventional compelling treatment with Heparin (a different anticoagulant) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a Stent (a short redness, which remains in the artery in order to prevent a clasp) and they additionally got other medicines to prevent clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or reascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from one PCI, Angiox was as effective in terms of all indicators as heparin, except for heavy bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heetahs.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other miludine or any of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a disease, as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or yeast infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a removable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd will receive a licence for the marketing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI)) at an emergency access or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialddose of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in the patient, an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg and infusion should be increased for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After PCI need to be back to clinical requirements the reduced intake dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioox in patients with one PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a certain Bolus Gift of Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Is this value (ACT after 5 minutes) shortened from 225 seconds, a second bolt from 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before applying the Bolusdosis rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with moderate kidney-functional (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are treated one PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be used a lower infusion of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, juveniles and children over six years with diabetes, who need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm, or is administered as a continuous fusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the Glucosespiegels (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin is very different from humaninsulin, and the change means that it affects faster and has a shorter active duration than a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce inulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2-diabetes, in which the body insulin has not been effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was to change the concentration of substance glycosyliated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates, how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type-1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% was determined after six months (by 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2-diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% for the normal normal normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin pulisin or any of the other constituents, or in patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must possibly be customized when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the bloodshed of kosher.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi Aventis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is as subcutaneous injector either to apply in the area of abdomen, surface or delta or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion in the area of abdominal body.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluceogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, the insulin is required in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the substance, the brand (Her- actors), the insulin delivery (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of treatment, especially in patients with a insulsive diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic crop. these conditions are potentially potentially deadly.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should be under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the efficacy profile of the used insulin, and can therefore change from the switch of the treatment schema.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances, which increase the blood-ckerle activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemic, include oral antidiabetic, fibrocramid, firefuses, monoamin oxidation (MAO) -Hemmer, Pentoxidiyllin, Propoxyphs, Salizylate and sulfonisian antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathies such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine the symptoms of the adrengen backlas have been weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductionism showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs into the human breast milk, but in general insulin does not enter into the breast milk, nor becomes resorated after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the drugs known from clinical studies (very frequently: ≥ 1 / 10; frequently: ≥ 1 / 10; frequently: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rarely: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare (frequency on the basis of the availability data is unsolved).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wiring failed to switch the injecting location within the injecting field, can occur in the result a Lipodystrophy on the injecting location.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycaemias with awareness can be treated with intra-muscular or subcutaneous injecting of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an accordingly trained person, or by a intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucagoninjeoption, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to ascertained the Ur- thing for the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level through the stimulation of the peripheral body intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Gaaes of insulin delivery occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1-diabetes melting us insulin pullulisin therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg a disproportionate share of the glucant effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a twice as rapid integration, such as normative Humaninsulin, and achieves the complete fiestal impact of about 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was obvious that in an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes prior to the meal a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control is reached as with the normal normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became insulin pulisin 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved a better postprandious control as with the normal normal insulin, which has been given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Becomes insulin pullulisin 15 minutes after the meal - wasted a comparable glycaemic control like in the normal normal normal insulin, which is given 2 mitigators in front of the meal (see picture 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal in comparison to humanistic normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (normal - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to humanistic normal normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (picture 1B).</seg>
