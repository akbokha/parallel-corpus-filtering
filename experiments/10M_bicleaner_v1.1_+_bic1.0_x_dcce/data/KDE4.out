the module website will be able to translate in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu to translate into the following webpage . select from the split list the source and target language of the translation .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part is the place of the entire &amp; URL .
mechanical translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , the translations should not be made of important decisions without checking the translation before .
only web pages on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to yourself on the bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert it directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by using these easily available .
further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings . open the card card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list with standard modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the cr@@ ashing module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; following extra stor@@ stor@@ s . then you can see the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of the stor@@ my if available , delete .
the module generator ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s updated working directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M Bau@@ man@@ ure in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select the extras DO@@ M show ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ates , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root k@@ not@@ ting .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text messages to view the content of your local file system .
the speci@@ ality of &amp; FS@@ View ; contains in it , sub@@ merged folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must own the property that the sum of the size of the lower object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a folder or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , large files , even then can be recognized easily if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are looked at .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the tre@@ ad depic@@ tion of a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easy navigation , the right @-@ ecke will possess reasonable shades and label settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on view mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the re@@ pro@@ vocation or picture of another file @-@ independent how name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature you can specify whether it is available at all , only if enough space to display is available or whether the surface of sub@@ ordered rectangle may occur ( although , however , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rectangle .
with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be adher@@ ed to proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ign@@ in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . it will be drawn frame to show the scr@@ aper of the entries and this framework requires space , which is then lost in subordin@@ ate entries if the rectangle square is square .
as division of the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries will be left to the implementation . here , it is so fragile and to supply space lu@@ sts by means always advantageous to the areas that are as square . the best methods on this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second @-@ division .
you can specify the minimal image for an entry about the menu entry view . instead , a frame pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; originally developed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

a easy @-@ to @-@ use camera station will be made available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; # ; of course each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; # .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos , to evaluate and correct . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; # comes ; easy to use , there is d@@ utz@@ ing professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color foam and all the available modules support the raw convergence via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC .
improved database with a lot more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens over which can be searched .
like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also as planned ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; Q : attempts to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you book yourself in the program , your web browser opens a page in the fault corrected system . all information you need is already registered here . follow only the instructions to submit your report .
&amp; Wr@@ ong , is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer will help one another . if you &apos;re a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes , then we would like to answer you questions about other users of &amp; # ; in this mailing list , however , you should be able to answer any questions about that language , you should be powerful to this language .
you can also check the digi@@ tization of this homepage to get news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes .
the best start to get off &amp; digi@@ re ; to participate is the registration in the developers mailing list . guidance to report in the developers mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; .
when you start &amp; checking out ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . you can simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder name folder to select a folder .
in the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for any image folder .
later , you can add so@@ as many folders as you want to add . &amp; Drop off ; will use it in addition as a Al@@ ben@@ library . Set@@ ting Settings .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can indicate the top folder , which contains images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fies every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you will receive a progress report like this :
&amp; Wr@@ ong , searches with recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you cannot submit any sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in a hidden folder . this can insert you or@@ bs &amp; digi@@ ti@@ d ; complete a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in my list will have no photos as symbols . you can change those by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ tised ; your digital camera set up . afterwards you should learn how to use my albums and My key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of resource support .
how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ le @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ le workflow .
a easy @-@ to @-@ use camera station will be made available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; # ; of course each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; # .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the camera will appear as disk drives . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use under circumstances to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; Intro@@ duction ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera recording . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported by picture transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association and allows transfer of images of digital cameras to calcul@@ ators and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are large files and transfers via serial port are slow , this compound is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and exec@@ utes the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with i@@ bex@@ if support so that EX@@ IF data is not required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 cam@@ er@@ eg@@ rets that could not be seen in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support could not be seen in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do &amp; digi@@ re ; is how easy it can extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ O modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tised ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to add &amp; # ; by writing a little module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
in order to simplify the window , you can either afford the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
the drag and drop images work anywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree , on the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture can not be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to raise the spread out : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , black , to@@ e , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . so , the filters on the fil@@ ename will be displayed only if this ind symbol@@ ises the toolbar as well . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ster quot ; provides an organized view on your photo sho@@ ots . these albums can be recorded according to folders in which they are stored on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or by date , where the album was first created , sorted out . the date can be altered in the characteristics of the album .
in case you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . you can also select a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select for album Import screen shot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . in the then shown menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can simply drag all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to access information about this collection . to access the album features , you have to right click on the album and select Alb@@ um@@ Properties menu in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can group your albums under a common name . the collection you choose from the toolbar you can select or delete albums from the toolbar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can put it in the settings for collections .
the album Date : will be used if you sort out your albums after date with view albums .
the buttons El@@ der , average , new test@@ er : these put the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . to this , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; Play first , the first image will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ster quot ; chosen to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album symbol , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a Alb@@ um@@ schau branch ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be n@@ ested .
&amp; Drop off ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list on the left below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in the picture window , you can preview the size of these curtains in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time you need to get short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid in which you generate all the thumb@@ nails again in the menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can change about Set@@ ting Settings . select here the albums page and customize your wishes to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails will have help windows . if you want to rest the cursor for a moment over a picture . the scre@@ enshot shows the most important features including all tags of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all that goes on at &amp; # . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to these . you can get all the functions that are using &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can choose between the view menu of the images , a di@@ asch@@ au or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and select Edit ... you can edit a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ly ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and adjust the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . therefore , and how you adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; KDE ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image editing programs related to problems with the metadata present in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
and checking out ; presents two options for rotation . the easiest way is to select the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select rotating . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . notice that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo taken out of &amp; # ; delete , it will move in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; moved . f@@ 8 image delete or relief if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift .
the view &amp; quot ; My date list is organized ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; checking out ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file .
once you choose a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can choose days or weeks in the date sheet in the dates below , so that you can only view the photos of the chosen days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organise and cat@@ alo@@ ze your photos . when a key@@ word was assigned , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a key@@ word was assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this keywords or a search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that were marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords logi@@ cally . you can also over@@ lap parts of the Tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; so you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easily find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and access key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are imported to the loss of database re @-@ imported as soon as it came out ; the pictures noticed .
you can add new tags , by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on a existing key@@ word and then select new key@@ word after you &apos;ve clicked on a new word , this stit@@ ch@@ word is this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it down . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by selecting it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the key@@ word and symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Alb@@ um@@ schau . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to deal &amp; digi@@ tised ; s functionality with key@@ word can be as@@ cribed on two types : once you have chosen the photos that you have chosen with a key@@ word , you can drop them onto the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can provide a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords available to him . this way you can set a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo menu and remove from the head@@ set menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the timer view shows a time @-@ dependent H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can be shifted via this H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the drop frame , which displays the tim@@ eline . thus all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , data stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ras@@ er Search box is a small lamp the green is found when searching for matches . if you click here , the fil@@ ming will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search did nothing , then the lamp will red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the teles@@ cope . if you open this you will find a simple search box like the one described above . you can search this search here as a live search , which always fil@@ tered what you entered as a search criterion . after you have been saved , t@@ d he filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be used in view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your search for the search , you only need to select the respective entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you search for searching , the form to enter the search returns with the previously entered search information . if you can edit an advanced search , the dialog for the extended search will be available . you will find more rules for your search . further information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , please select in the context menu search .
the extended search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters available , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; # ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search question in the album database . all rules are added to add or deleted from this list . each option can be added with others about the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or minimum ... link . in addition , you can create searching the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this enables it to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the less the difference between two image sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a Corpor@@ al@@ erts , the results can be enlarged or red@@ ded . if you push a picture of somewhere about the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand colour sketch : draw a fast sketch and checking out ; finds the matching pictures . also here can be a default value .
this rider provides an intuitive map @-@ search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ box . you can pull with the mouse wheel in or out @-@ zoom or stick and move it . move it in the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this pres@@ upp@@ oses the your images Ge@@ o data contained .
in the below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ graphy .
&amp; Drop comes ; presents a lumin@@ osity in a separate window available with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ aire add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ ouse and opened its window . if you &apos;re back in &amp; # ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire fast with L extras .
from the thumb@@ nails , you can drag and drop the images you want to see in the left or right area of the window . if you want to preview the copy in which window size is shown . if you perform Preview from the toolbar , you will also be executed with the toolbar . you can also compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly choose from a picture series . if you use pairs of images from the toolbar . you can now view the left mouse button at any preview image , to display it in the left @-@ hand side . this will simplify the right mouse button in the right area . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal sol@@ em@@ akers will also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light@@ ouse . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function , that you can see in the crossed arrows . to view the visible area of the picture , you must click on the click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; they will then capture both images in the same image .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse @-@ wheel in order to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you preview the mode .
what is a digital stock company - off from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process , after the image was made up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to find a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedure for digital photographer the &amp; checking out ; use . we look at the procedure for digital photographer the &amp; checking out ; we look at downloading , backup , backup , sa@@ wing , uni@@ fying , archiving , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Management assumes in , categorized , categ@@ or@@ ised , seeks , transformed , conf@@ ected , and exports content that hab@@ by a mon@@ e@@ bears or cultural value . quot ;
metadata are defined as data . metadata are provided in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or manage other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you want to find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not just use it checking out ; . the approach to save Met@@ adata in a database as well as in image files , you can easily browse and secure a secure filing on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you need anything in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos are to store or on a network drive &amp; etc . please note that you will have to change to a bigger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can quickly be found via your location . if you organize sufficient photos , then you will make sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , working procedures , constant transfer of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files , and you will then not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files are fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking simple . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend that the Met@@ adata option save in the Settings page of the Met@@ adata in &amp; # ; this is certain that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget that , you can subsequently select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point menu on the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change something ? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes , of course these are the most important ones .
now begin the real work as you should now assign any photo keywords , label and valu@@ ation . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . they start making sense as you can concentrate on the best photos while you &apos;re working on .
let us now move with keywords , key@@ boards , as you frequently called by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ onyms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it will always turn the tree for you to insert the pictures in the correct place . the modifications of hierarchy inside the building is no problem and can simply be done by moving from a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while the sub@@ trees were pursued .
the graphic shows how different metadata cut itself . this is a very cru@@ de representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth out of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section relates to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! one begins to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama .
for other viewing your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help Him over the mo@@ tive that you moved on what you understand .
it is ok if an image is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a let@@ tering for itself .
by checking out , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures . KDE , these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the Web gallery . you will have to tell the story for opening a second time .
remember the days before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a te@@ di@@ ous planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of Ge@@ olo@@ k@@ alisation are already countless and will continue in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily be able to open your trips virtually through images with geo@@ graphic information . you can then also export the photos at the recording site . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and refers to the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information is stored in the furnishings site of &amp; digi@@ tization ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for actors and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , such as the name of a company or organisation , it should not be changed any longer . this field does not support Kom@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for contrac@@ tion ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment to the author field , this must be filled in as well .
editors ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have the author . if the photographer is working here for a message agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a camp@@ oto , here the picture / agency the image is shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the solution to this problem . for individuals , this is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ marks is unique per image . &amp; # , in the near future , such a module can be made available for forkli@@ fts .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data @-@ creation company of the world , has some interesting statistics which has loss of data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must not be treated longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives , which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your yield area .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good asc@@ ents and make them in the correct way store . the best DVD bu@@ oy@@ ancy securities are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . therefore , it turns the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to errors , even if you have just written it . therefore , use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control environments . despite this massive protection , they are needed for chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a more favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seem to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications , which damaged the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , fl@@ ashes , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good appreciation of high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then storing in a clean , dark dry and above animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be updated to this media .
dis@@ ket@@ ma@@ sts retain your statistics for itself . their manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives : dis@@ missing the disk
in short : discs hold at the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ am@@ ur@@ range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ am@@ ers the fault rate dramatically increases the most common error messages , SMAR@@ T can not determine this error . some of SMAR@@ T fixed mistakes will notice the immediate im@@ min@@ ence . these are especially readers and deposits . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also loss data loss due to an output before you secured the files , but these losses usually leave without major problems .
while most electrical devices power cl@@ ashes do not make a lot of account , the anom@@ ali@@ es with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can take severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware boards and other defects . protect yourself from the Un@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power shar@@ pen is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy @-@ slots and feed the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices .
because a over@@ voltage of each cable has to be used to your computer , you should be sure that even all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and also contain the protection for modem . this makes you ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even an incident of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ rides these devices can automatically place cordless energy if an electric loss occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and restart the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifes@@ pan of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security with electricity disorders associated with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected accordingly . to conclude , you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are compared to hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB fees &amp; co@@ b ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable for a local loss of data loss . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online memory services available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional option provides you more available , in case of Flickr dramatic more . for $ 25 a year , you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data Backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with major companies is included in the offer of a backup and a partial memory . this makes it safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ but@@ fs put at least the data integr@@ ability between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred , not even if it was in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you would not be destroyed by any day . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ fer@@ encing within the data streams . with normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on lower level and can be highly scalable . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its own free file system . this is still in the Alpha Status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss at the notebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . when not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them . it leads to a lower damage , than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no more sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itinerary , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the broad@@ ened fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main valu@@ ables for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical limitations .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for comp@@ act@@ cameras and end result , the optimum solution for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
one 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by any loss of data . so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything else just like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destroyed a lot . forget the aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential assurance : a backup of the files modified since the last complete backup . produces a complete snapshot of the two time points : the complete assurance and the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been altered since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time and restore such backup . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only secluded and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a Wonder@@ ful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP session or other types of file transfer scripts , copies only the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens de@@ compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other visual medium .
this procedure makes you enough time to detect losses and restore it . at the same time you come for backup however with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of for at least one month and a snapshot of each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , OS@@ es , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , Use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future because of your nature is un@@ predictable , you have to look at caution and evaluate everything today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage , storage technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means enlarge .
let &apos;s take the scal@@ ability that you have entered into the scal@@ ability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been detected by the system , but you do not hang it up .
&amp; D / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; size of the plate in MB@@ O ; # 16 , 32 and travel fs &amp; D ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of travel if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create them yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that goes slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was used as an open source standard developed by GIF . however , it can be more pleasurable , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can only have many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you for storing your images .
TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF is stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ sy compres@@ sor salt ( de@@ fl@@ ates ) , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . it is now available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why to replace the XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself . file information is saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP fits into being separately from the image file and as indicated above , the raw @-@ format is painted . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of applications and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI is working on a architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , standard links and informative efforts to reach a far @-@ depth acceptance of metadata and practices .
import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as pictures are on the camera to use it , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert AVI files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archives . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; # then you should add the metadata again . these were recorded under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into Web@@ Gall@@ eries , paste into MPEG , use in contact leaves , print you &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; # . in the section of adding a photo to an album , you will find a description how you can add photos , which you can already have on your hard disk . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised ; connect it to the machine , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it . you can find a further description in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ous indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information about each entry . with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally from the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available all the information .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer @-@ remark , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their host , is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this loads photographs from her camera to a single album in &amp; Play ; . when downloading the photos are deleted secur@@ ely in an album , before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; KDE ; as soon as you choose the photos , use the button download and then download the selected . the button selected is out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera is supported it is an option New download . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tised ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons All download or download it , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in the photo . details about folder sorting can be displayed in the section My records . then select the target album from the list and click OK .
after having selected the target album , click OK , and &amp; # , the photos from the camera will load into the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by delete the button Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete some , then you must select them first and use Del@@ ete Del@@ ete .
note : please note that there is no possibility of photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check whether the photos are successful into a &amp; checking out ; if you want to delete it completely from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should get this about the camera screen , since this is much faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ tired , after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can be useful to load photos from different scenes in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the picture and for date @-@ based under@@ scores . if you use this last option automatically a folder is created each day .
the options during transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all loaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo - % - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option date and time to add . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strate time .
if you use the camera file names , you will have the option when downloading the file names in small letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; checking out ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that provides the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame is saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time .
&amp; checking out ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to run a time of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar , you can read further details , about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo .
the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turn off , use the button black@@ out and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera will provide information about the date on which the photo has been made , can compile &amp; digi@@ tization ; this sub @-@ collection are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the page side@@ bar , you can read which information your camera might be embedded into the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; checking out ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . just use the button &apos; s @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer on their camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog and KDE ; appears in which you can select the files you want to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; Q : you , where the pictures should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and click OK to load the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this represents a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and that can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers could it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later the photo was taken , you can click with a click on a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; # ; users want to locate the location of the photos , or just document it , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data be assisted in the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and cart@@ ography support . the question is actually more like the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , using a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files to geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ remote Eye I@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use these script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ folded coordinates that are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
it gives you so much control of his work @-@ flows as possible . there are many settings that you access the behavior of &amp; # ; to set up the Settings dialog , you have to switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons to the left .
action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing . you can set the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised ; when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected to download from the camera database . also with a database synchronization , this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .

the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this makes it possible that the metadata are permanent in the picture and not only in the database by &amp; digi@@ tised ; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without lost .
images can be saved as built @-@ in pictures ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos with the pictures included in the pictures . caution : with pictures that are already included , these are over@@ written by the photos of &amp; # .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cursor moves in the main window above one file . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ ly ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; checking out ; indicate , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove it . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ly ; album sub@@ folders that none of these extensions have been replaced by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ d ; ignored .
you can re@@ vert the default settings by pressing the button Up@@ dating right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can then open on this page onto the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should use only on fast calcul@@ ators . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results .
by default , the image processing shows a black background behind the photos displayed . if you prefer a different color , you can choose them here . you can switch the toolbar button when you use image editing in full @-@ screen mode .
Over@@ - and under@@ exposed parts of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this picture Mode can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in dy@@ es . please read this article in Wikipedia for the further explanation .
with the setting PNG @-@ compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is using a lu@@ cent free algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value on a high compression . here means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files comp@@ ress , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ates -@@ comp@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ ms for TIFF pictures . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is running smoothly .
with the adjustment of loss of JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can easily store out . even if you have to select the lu@@ lu@@ te setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata still not supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ re , the image processing was just a pic@@ ks for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard l@@ ame is that all green pixels are identical . if the straight @-@ hand green pixels of the CCD @-@ Sens@@ ors in the output lines . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option marks the picture a little soft , eliminated but the 2@@ x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the whit@@ ew@@ ater is used with the camera . otherwise , if set , the Automatic paint balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white comparison is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card in the sunlight , is based .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps more details in the highlights . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it is the nick@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to catch the shar@@ pen@@ ed . in addition , you can use the adjusting control through white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the ch@@ ie@@ ties .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick s@@ ati@@ ous like green and red . and d@@ Cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ shares from the still not saturated blue resolution . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you choose to construct the option , you get the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can / therefore be customized for each picture individually .
put the grain @-@ value according to your taste . you probably have to set it a bit higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tised surface . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed more conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process , to generate a complete picture from the partial images , which has many cameras and that provides a matrix color@@ less pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; checking out ; and D@@ jer@@ w make you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ Cra@@ w . however , it produces colour lines at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color error correction , since you are carried out during the rough .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ly ; information about how to translate the color information from a color room in the other so the colors are as accurately as possible .
behaviour Ques@@ tions , if an image is opened in the image processing , the colour administration module with raw files will start .
color profile folder S@@ lets you find the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; # then this folder will then examine during the starting point .
set of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ screen view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures colored does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ tone mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently , d@@ Cra@@ w Materials is not required for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color@@ ative mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given from a device . this is very useful before you print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of leaving the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them for what . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ officially :
the Canon ind@@ le expands the style to the destination : F for precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; image plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; KDE ; image galleries and image processing tasks . by delivering this interface can and digi@@ tised ; many modules support that were written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ O modules , you will see a list of the available modules . select the one you want to use and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find a few in the context menu of the thumb@@ nails .
short command for tasks that can be performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I module , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project on htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator rose the time between the picture above , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other tick @-@ fields turn the metadata one or out which ends at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right there is a button automatic detection , which is temp@@ ted to identify a camera connected to the computer . currently , here are the port settings . currently , here , serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage devices are supported .
at the bottom you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected one US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera model . you have to indicate the path , / m@@ ns / camera or / m@@ ns / susp@@ ect on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; # ; you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it into the ad mode .
try out whether &amp; checking out ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera dell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can see the conversation of &amp; digi@@ re ; with the deletion of a photos in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photos and del@@ eting an album , you can find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be imp@@ lied by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without revers@@ ing . otherwise , you will need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also check the display of the welcome screen saver of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; when st@@ em@@ ate it , under certain circumstances this acceler@@ ates the starting point of &amp; # .
the adjustment App@@ m Start@@ ing to new photos is forcing or checking out ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos to search . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zes ; . if something was deleted from the basic folder , it asks you whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; # ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings allow you to select settings from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; find out more about it in this tutorial .
&amp; # 3 ; contains a quick picture processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and adjust to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of viewing ad / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised ; therefore they are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the section image editing .
a stat@@ line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ um@@ mer , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the upper edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most used functions .
editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before saving the file or save the button save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer save the original photo once you have saved the photo .
so you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it save with file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or button the button &quot; button restore the image editing to the toolbar . you will then lose any change that you have been performed at the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by installing manipul@@ ated or restored by selecting editing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should be able to make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to turn off and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB on the back@@ tracking or re @-@ button in the toolbar button , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image editing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar . if you have made changes in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to store them .
you can put in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the picture .
to adjust a photo to window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlarge factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in setting dialog by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; you can view it in the Settings dialog . see this section to set up the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print images in the menu and get the standard &amp; KDE ; print@@ dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . all picture @-@ pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album exports printing coach . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the default window has a side bar on the right edge , provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation sp@@ lin@@ le , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five horse@@ men is clicked on :
multiple @-@ click on the same rider can appear the side@@ bar or disappear back into the edge .
in the mod@@ ality view you can insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the label will be copied in the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut to 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after downloading it , you can either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the label will then be saved .
in addition to the using button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the Assessment section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting . it can either be applied to one single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars on the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them from and use the context menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . enco@@ ding follows the schema in the following table :
the keywords show a search box to the filters of the keywords , the key@@ word @-@ tree and a selection box with the key@@ word before in this &amp; checking out ; session designated .
the key@@ word @-@ tree is dynamically adapted to the key@@ word . you can limit the number of ways in searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is further relief in entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding cross@@ ings in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main view , select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you wish to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and Su@@ k@@ ec@@ ules . if additionally some or more key@@ word filter is used from the right hand , only the inter@@ sections of the two are displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop some pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can easily drag it from the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog displays whether you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window shows the images on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords , which was reduced by the amount to three pictures . they were taken with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word was dra@@ gged from the right key@@ word @-@ tree to the selection and placed there . a dialog asked if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place every start of the program . it can also be switched among settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be a or be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry which is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example you can choose a wide search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to group the cross@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options look like this :
why not listed Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr ? free disk space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got it on &amp; digi@@ ly ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color@@ fully @-@ managed workflow , using the colors available from your camera or scanner , you can reach that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner , and the colors you print or publish on the web that you want from your digital dark@@ room .
if the issue comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons and press needs to provide for the results he wants . unfortunately , this tutorial makes it possible to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you obtain the result you want .
if your image operates all the six below listed below , then you do not need to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color foam . ( further information can be found below )
their only other pictures are via e @-@ mail or the Web where the R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if the R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everybody so simple , then why should one use another color room and therefore have to worry about color wounded ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ gely @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB color foam , the tri@@ angular region .
if you wish to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional Re@@ presentation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click information and then information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I k@@ eren my Monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ GB color room ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB color or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor since s@@ R@@ GB itself that your ; on@@ itor is placed on s@@ R@@ GB . so if you &apos;re working as in the color line of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitoring profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , inten@@ tional , automatic and contrast from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ble automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . they will be experimenting with these effects to see which best in your photo works .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ ance values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its shades . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
same : this method adju@@ sters the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image , so that the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , it also produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic sc@@ aling : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue @-@ canal . you select the dark and bright boundary and adjust the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the entire H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest range and a revival of all values in between . this is only visible when washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo .
the white @-@ off correction is somewhat limited as there is a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are so too far from the original image , can perform areas with over@@ exposure , which is working in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ mon , protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it using the menu entry of white glu@@ es to the image processing .
the showcase can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side are both the original image and the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whit@@ ew@@ ater settings again , then you can click the original window .
the preview of the target sn@@ aps has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this marker is shown as vertical line in the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
to the right , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is shown that dynamically changed once you have a parameter change . this h@@ is@@ o@@ gram is very helpful as , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ escent values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadows of alignment can also improve the shadows of your photos or also be pl@@ ain@@ ly .
An@@ stat with the above checks around to play , you should use the paint temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the white water temperature . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard line with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure index increases the colors when more than one colour canal is over@@ exposed to the size . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as loading and store exactly this . each setting of the white is set you can save in a text file and then load again later .
the button default settings all filter values back to their standard values and the neutral neutr@@ ality . notice that the neutral settings will be shown a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will change .
you can adjust here the co@@ ding beads per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality photos . this co@@ ding is also necessary for high quality photos . this co@@ ding is also needed more record time , calcul@@ ating time and stands on@@ ly@@ re for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw materials . paint tone mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color films may take you to the chapter of Color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors and correctly . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colors channels simultaneously and allow you to use your settings at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same bug and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find further information .
one very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for generating that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the plate le@@ ased ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ek@@ te presents you four color effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter available .
in times of chemical processing , solar isation , even Sab@@ ati@@ ans is called , an effect of the developed pressure . the colored , dar@@ ker areas sheltered from the additional light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lights . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity shows the image of what chem@@ ically possible is . a further increase is ultimately a negative picture that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar effects . the original image is ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation thus making it a stronger contrast @-@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ oss . try it easily , it em@@ bell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ eb@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some photographs , especially those who are hardly har@@ ness , too much .
the ne@@ on filter is sim@@ ulated ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast @-@ can@@ es . the parameter levels controlled the brightness of the result and the s@@ late repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with large images the filter can reduce the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color@@ fully and the lumin@@ osity of your photo with the tools in the menu on colors . all your adjusting entries can be viewed at the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo at bad light conditions , you can get the revers@@ ed problem : one too big s@@ ati@@ ety . even in this case , the tool for brightness / s@@ ati@@ ety is a good choice to enhance the satur@@ ation . if you perform the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool engra@@ ving and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool Ton@@ valu@@ ation to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need for the purpose of explained purposes only the area of shal@@ e . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graphs of the intensity values , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under graphs are three sli@@ ders included in the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn to learn is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the Preview will be dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selective box can be adjusted , whether the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is shown with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic presentation is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top priority for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three color pin@@ p@@ all@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the pockets of the shadow , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output files : extract the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two buttons that can be used to evaluate the output devices as well as with the inputs . for example , the compression of the outlet can be used for example to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the values indicated in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and re@@ charged later . this is the game level format used .
if you use this mode and the three paint cor@@ es , the input data will automatically adjust to all shadows , resources and Sundays . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the H@@ ist@@ o@@ grams for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ als .
the Trans@@ duc@@ ting Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the output files are unchanged . the original picture is marked ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) marked .
the left side shows the half of the original and the target image . the Preview will be dynamically updated according to your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fier Channel : this selection box allows the channel to indicate which it is changed by the module :
besides this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
if you post@@ cards for example a cou@@ rier to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark @-@ forks , corresponding and the corresponding picture stri@@ ves are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and then move it down and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each bend that you created can be saved in fil@@ esystem and later be loaded on . file format is the Gimp _ ven@@ format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ ps , the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sunny sounds . enable the color p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator that you only get the effect shown in the Preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which has been corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sunny notes was set with the dy@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er of &amp; checking out ; image processing is a tool to improve the color@@ ations or to change the shade of shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel sel@@ ector , you can choose the color for the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first reference to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram to indicate the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to enable these channels . if you need L@@ umin@@ ance , the monitor mix@@ er then adjust the tool to create magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour leads to an invisible rob@@ ber@@ y that comes from the bull &apos;s color and its smoke pattern is different in each channel differently . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion , in which you can reduce the bull first .
the save as and store buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load it . used file format is the Gimp / Mix@@ er format .
the Trans@@ duc@@ ting Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue Canal has been re@@ activated . the L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance option is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / White is a working step , since color images can easily be converted to your computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford United 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good in all the scenario pictures and fits especially well to portraits of the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange flower filter . this improves landscape , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dram@@ ati@@ cal effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar effects to the time of time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotor filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure to a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural hu@@ ton@@ ed correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones while it adds a bit col@@ dness in the shadows of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ sis . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ tization ; tool texture enables you to apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the styles of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image texture , use image editing can be used for it .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
in line checking out ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is no easy task . one way to keep his attention is to view the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under picture frames , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired Rachel type for your picture . detail the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce envel@@ ops it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , abbrevi@@ ated it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ed effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with designs .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image with the frame arranged is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially when you &apos;ve used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text in an image of any place . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just type the text and place it with the mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color foam and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . you &apos;ll just select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ touch background . already , the picture is ready .
each setting which you chose to have chosen for your text can press , until you press the button &quot; OK , &quot; the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the checking of bed ; tool w@@ abl@@ one can apply you a template over a picture .
the menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should want to add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to res@@ ize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the file size of the template , simply send an e @-@ mail in English to die &amp; digi@@ re ; mailing list digi@@ re @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
when you use this tool for first time , you need to put your zip @-@ folder with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the template has been set out a construction @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ or@@ ord@@ ner . selecting a folder updating the thumb@@ nails of the template automatically .
under the Preview will find three buttons , which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is the default image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b divi@@ der the below image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must classi@@ fy the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below to the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adjusted automatically by default size .
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; provides three different tools for tigh@@ tening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for raising . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
impro@@ per mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s doing a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most dig@@ itali@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution must be combined into a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more vol@@ ati@@ fication as normal cameras for private user .
in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the process .
some scanner is turning a field filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable it , you get the control over your picture .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen a photo with the edge @-@ level signal . you can tigh@@ test with the menu entry under basket .
however you should deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the edge increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also intensi@@ fying the smoking . in general , the usable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture the tool re@@ direc@@ ting . under re@@ focus you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for raising .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is to be cris@@ p . the solution to record the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry to cor@@ rigi@@ ble and experiment with it . the showcase on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help to edit the image . the display window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values generate frequent results and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you create the bl@@ ur@@ red mask , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges are produced .
the radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a can@@ te are affected by the filters . high @-@ res images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore take pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wi@@ pes picture to be added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a split out of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable differential amount . it can thus define a minimum difference thus for a se@@ wn of the filter . in this way areas are avoided with a soft switch between the killing from shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore flaw in faces , sk@@ ies and aqu@@ atic surfaces .
this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; tool re@@ direc@@ ting a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyrighted filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries one image to &amp; quot ; in which there is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can start making use of a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can start it from the menu by calling colors rever@@ ting in the image editing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung operates a lot better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads far from the source pixel , which depends far from the original size . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular capac@@ itor : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the standard value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should become very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then on Heiligen@@ stadt .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter allows you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will consume the picture even further .
gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use this parameter to avoid excessive bl@@ unt filter . in most cases , you should use this value to zero in order to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may need to also increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ rou@@ gh@@ ter filters .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular field or the gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen field . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving als and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any amount focused parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then .
try to perform all tri@@ mmer , color and intensity correc@@ tions in the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not visible immediately , but subsequently leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and compres@@ sing images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results as sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by this , the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king uses a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ens .
theoretically have to become bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king ever arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of un@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear filter . convenient is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in editing small details .
below you can see a comparison of the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
for more information on the methods to the edge correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ets is the bl@@ ur@@ redness of the area of the black@@ ed black@@ ed to generate a more natural pel@@ let .
the dy@@ tin@@ te enables a customized color for the gro@@ ove . in case you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image inf@@ alli@@ ble is one of the most sophisticated tool to remove not the art@@ e@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ for@@ algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the available preference are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings on a tuning , you can use the tab@@ let@@ tering and advanced settings .
detail : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a moderate smo@@ o@@ thing about the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details that no depth is necessary . please note that the details should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction .
Ri@@ ding @-@ dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ularity or the CCD smoke will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ e@@ facts are best found at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ o@@ thing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ o@@ thing . therefore put this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher that value is set , the more being smo@@ ked , because it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 .
re@@ tries : returns on how often the algorithm is going through . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle measur@@ ably since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be small . be sure that small angles can be a long running time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs .
integrated stri@@ de @-@ wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de range in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ o@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . he doubles but the running time . therefore we recommend him to let him go .
the buttons save as loading and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file saved and re@@ charged later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load to itself . you can then cancel the calculation at any time with the button break .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that is being taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black @-@ fact caused by a bad documentary during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking comes ; smo@@ o@@ reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing tol@@ ling . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. by dust or hair on the lens , to remove . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ id ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about Sensor cameras from digital cameras , then you can read them in English on this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ de noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that is required for the filters per pixel and can fa@@ sten the picture above the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus made smaller bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controlled the edge field . this value sets the pixel rate to determine the filter changes . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filters are deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and smoke or lubric@@ ate comes back on .
edges : controlled the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise or smo@@ kers can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a wax or JPEG @-@ art@@ e@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you to either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the credi@@ ting process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controlled the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the credi@@ ting process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controlled the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark @-@ colored areas , which typically more soli@@ di@@ fied , however , it also consum@@ es the s@@ lat@@ ted areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter reaction to variations of ligh@@ tness is re@@ acted . if it is increased to appear , the edges can occur and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges can occur and is the recommended method for it .
save and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the smoking reduction you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) marked . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is a snack for your purpose . the solution to paint the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft sign with the menu entry to cor@@ rigi@@ ble and experiment with the smo@@ o@@ thing . the showcase on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ re ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photographs .
this filter to restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to emerge Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sches Rau@@ schen , Film@@ gran@@ ularity , scrat@@ ches , compression clothing and local errors that occurs in digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ tised images , and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text @-@ composition . the text @-@ composition is performed with another tool , the image editor , performed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ da and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . than a lu@@ cent compres@@ sing compres@@ s@@ sal@@ ms it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting aims to correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and be re@@ charged later .
photo recovery is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button end .
below you can reduce like a photo with a uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film @-@ gran@@ ularity on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo recovery . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo , used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the checking out ; tool hot@@ bed allows it to remove pictures of photographs showing with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression to have a built @-@ in su@@ pre@@ d for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture @-@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
when you have an old digital camera it is important to pick you up the dark picture right next to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark &apos;s image will find the bad pixels . notice that the wizard shows the last dark picture and that automatically loads it again in the next session .
the image field and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all pre@@ views .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixel and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
thir@@ st@@ : it becomes an average of the neigh@@ bor to be determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block , are drawn up to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ called ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ called ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ called ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ called ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixel in the block .
cub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ lic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ ness correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing . the original picture was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the checking out ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the Vig@@ net@@ ing , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image to correct .
vast@@ ly objective , especially those in the medium and large photo @-@ format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting wh@@ ites ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by using the light that the sensor can be achieved there . Tele@@ objective sometimes also show this behavior .
but he also has disadvantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . vast@@ ly objective you should also use Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ly effects may arise through motion .
with the large exposure ranges of current filtration and colour levels of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a blan@@ ket which is made without this filter . the tool of Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is applied to an image . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ e@@ correction filter and with three further exposure to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of luminous shock absorption at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting from an optical filter with a aper@@ ture of 2 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater level of Vig@@ net@@ ing , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target with these options . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will provide you only positive values as you just need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ fine tuning of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the engra@@ ving from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ation ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) indicates the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ance and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out at the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient treats the general geomet@@ ric sti@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conc@@ ave shape of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect , fla@@ cht but at the edges . this correction is not applied to the tool .
the co@@ efficient pair of gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to the second gradient . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion almost eliminated .
general : this value is controlling the strength of the distor@@ tion second gradient . with negative values , tons of tons can be corrected and positive values of cr@@ ushed distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion 4th gradient . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient . negative values increase while positive the image increases .
bright : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values that you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values .
the injury or spher@@ ical correction should be performed prior to all gen@@ cuts or size changes . in case you are able to re @-@ cut this correction as all of the first . in case you are able to re @-@ cut a picture and perform a tons @-@ shaped correction , the effect is obvious .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it into an important spot , such as the marine margin or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tons / k@@ ci@@ ble distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
when you correct an adhesive tip , the resulting image will have black corners . you can transform it with the tri@@ mmer tool in the menu , cut out the image editing or through the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
for most images the ink @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some motives , such as shots of the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles at the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have an easy distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons to be applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulating inf@@ ra @-@ film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter reproduced the famous Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
beneath the preview , you can adjust two parameters adjust film gran@@ ularity and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option add movie gran@@ ules when you sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . ISO @-@ regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter colors to reproduce by infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ly applied to a landscaped photo made from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the cutting @-@ light .
the &amp; checking out ; filter film gran@@ ularity is a simple to use tool to reproduce film @-@ gran@@ ularity in your images . this is of classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , well known . to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers blend great silver gran@@ ulators of the photo em@@ ulsion .
the film @-@ gran@@ ative effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere , or seems to move back into the past . the described picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular vision specifically in your mono@@ chrome photographs , you must use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bas@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ary effect applied to a black / white picture . the original image is ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) . the original film @-@ sensitivity matches ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ re ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking out ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting . natural images and style live are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to affect this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth , the smo@@ o@@ thing or , from the other side considered , the uniqueness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ ch size for this 640 pixels high image is 1 and Gl@@ ät@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous was used ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses colour and Int@@ ensity to produce a cab@@ bage @-@ pattern . pictures whose engra@@ ving is slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower tuning the contrast ( smo@@ o@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings from 30 to 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ se ; filter engra@@ ving shows your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stre@@ amed in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ se ; filter grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ opoli@@ tical landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and it causes it as if it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : similar to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of gl@@ are blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button be@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of impro@@ per effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture along st@@ ern@@ för@@ m@@ iger lines which go from a center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the photography photography .
radi@@ al invali@@ dity : caught the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
removal thread : caught the picture in order to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement motion : caught the picture through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft identi@@ fier : caught the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
shot @-@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur in an arbitrary camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color @-@ basin in the picture and caught it without change the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button be@@ ating .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . thereby it gives natural your images a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the tro@@ p . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not growing automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . quantity changes the number and the density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use the &amp; # ; image editing to keep an area free of rain drops . use the choice tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free of charge . if you start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the rainy filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the def@@ aults have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers or mir@@ rors mir@@ rors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to do smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you get an image infl@@ atable and keep the details sharp ? how can you get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is doing a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to adjust the size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ation , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size will be retained .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher that value is set , the more being smo@@ ked , because it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as loading and loading are used accurately . any plug @-@ in for photo can be saved as a text file and be re@@ charged later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast at what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load upon yourself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button end .
you can see below an example of photo sho@@ bles by comparing a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the thumb@@ nail ( 2 ) is the result of linear magnific@@ ation to compare .
the random@@ ly cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to merge an image . the image editing allows you to simply cut the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and tigh@@ tening the rectangle then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off , then you get a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can adjust the size of the window by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by simply clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button O@@ cutting @-@ button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the File Save File Save File save the image file in order to save the re @-@ cut photo .
you can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will remain intact .
in tool after aspect ratio , you can supply the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and the width is assigned to the width .
the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to centered the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to the area to suit the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the tool system , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the assemb@@ ling help enable assistance to enable you to better put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sections are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to divide the rectangle into similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that looks at various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the flo@@ wering of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used throughout the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to make your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is guided by Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 1 . a composition that will follow this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden middle offers liquid guides available when you put a picture together . these help are dealt down below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will enable you to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule , the Golden Spir@@ al creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition carries the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this type .
a further rule is called the rectangle of the golden spiral , also called Golden Tri@@ angles . it should be something that the eye is at the center of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without being the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , Golden Tri@@ angles are not equivalent tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ally on these lines can place a static object of dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you generate a effect of by professional photographers and dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic part .
with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to grasp the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; # ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select it transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angles . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button default , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right of the window .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cursor in the image look around the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function to cut out of the image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically tru@@ sting . select one of the following options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ ali@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a little bit after the rotation . take note of the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture . the Preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the base area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right @-@ hand corner of the base area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the base area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the base area .
after adjustment of the perspective the image will be a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ ters generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this when possible .
after starting the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to clean it , it is the picture with transform@@ ers to cut out of the image editing .
the tool system is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal template , for example will move the top portion of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the picture is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram .
shot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you push on preference , the angles will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right of the preview field .
to your help you will end up a vertical and a horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool system to adjust your image .
after you have performed the lubrication , the picture will be a bit confused . for a single di@@ fication , this effect is usually negoti@@ able twice as much as it and therefore you should avoid this .
after closing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it , it is the picture with transform@@ ers to cut out of the image editing .
&amp; checking out ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write reviews . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you &apos;ll be able to edit a large number of pictures formats .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; Q : displays only files in formats that knows . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , then the file is displayed in the image editing . you can change this list of file extensions that end &amp; checking . in the configuration section you will find further information about this .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format you use . a ful@@ ler description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; # 3 ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save in this way the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can see under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can easily find raw @-@ format pictures in JPEG or TIFF . in the section configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ tization .
&amp; digi@@ re ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ Cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze . all support cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats which will be out of &amp; digi@@ tised . :
many digital cameras will support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . it &apos;s not a film processing program and therefore does not have a built @-@ in features movies or checking . if you click on a movie file , then it &apos;s going to use &amp; KDE ; settings for playing movies to run the program for playback .

many tools you need to get the photo editing are contained in &amp; digi@@ tization ; contain your description here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , smo@@ o@@ op@@ ting , cra@@ ving , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , and etc ; . use a uniform dialog ty@@ p that displays the effect in a preview before the filter to the current image is applied . below you see &amp; quot ; texture an@@ et quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview field . these modes are :
vertically share without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected thumb@@ nails .
horizontal without duplic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the area below the selected thumb@@ nails .
vertically share . the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the thumb@@ nails when the mouse is not in the pro@@ w@@ driver and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general adjustment site .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse inside the image and take on the part of the picture you want to preview the thumb@@ nails . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is an help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings are marked by the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar properties show the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data originates from EX@@ IF data when available .
this rider provides an intuitive map @-@ search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ box . you can pull with the mouse wheel in or out @-@ zoom or stick and move it . move it in the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this pres@@ upp@@ oses the your images Ge@@ o data contained .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and can be used from colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; KDE , can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; KDE ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and allow@@ able colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color of next . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
he can also be used to elect . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse to the left mouse button .
if the cros@@ sover box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes one else ; depending on whether the mode type has been selected . this mode allows you to adjust by selecting the cross @-@ box under Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each colour three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional hu@@ name , followed by a row @-@ end sign , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colours in the palette and the selection of colours can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in color selection on the left .
&amp; S@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graph@@ ers ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise graph@@ ers . the programs that obsol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; S@@ graph@@ viewer : project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program to replace it .
&amp; S@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graph@@ ers ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; S@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a good integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

the K@@ IP@@ O module images can be read and tools available to read and storing new images .
this module can be used to read and storing new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner which is supported by the SA@@ NE project or other sources such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
if you scan the menu entry images will open a dialog you can select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default def@@ aults values , to select your picture accordingly . watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you can preview the picture below . the cher@@ ished file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
be sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may otherwise be indicated .
after you have pushed scanning the button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target image . here you can select the compression and type of image file . here you can also remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
different screen@@ shots you can create after you selected in the menu Import , &gt; Screen foto ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different scre@@ aming ot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window selected is selected , the retri@@ eval program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be able to read after a short delay , the currently visible place . if you have chosen the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse can be read .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ ktops , you should choose this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above was shown .

the K@@ IP@@ O module for geographical localization makes it possible to add GPS coordinates to the metadata of an image and edit . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and the loc@@ alisation may be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ O module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available to locate images geo@@ graphically in the spher@@ ical co @-@ ordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphical loc@@ alisation corpor@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
choose the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above dialog then appears . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and localization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same places as pictures of your camera .
when the file loads a automatic cor@@ relation is carried out the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera can be carried out with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . put here your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation provides an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera control . if the vari@@ ance of these are merged , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS is , you can put that limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you notice a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog you follow the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed card and enlarge . choose the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Run this again and again by until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be exchanged between map mode , satellite view and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that it is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ O module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages for version 4.@@ 01 . you can choose the albums that are exported as HTML pages and set the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will be made of UT@@ F @-@ 8 for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders on which the settings can be adjusted . you just need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the field below , the alpha show and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely explan@@ atory . the option to click on a picture in which every picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; C@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML export that includes all , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF data of your original images are also stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the standard color @-@ depth . this naturally influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab shows you some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press release to break the process .
when the module has created the pages the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program@@ ing program to determine whether errors encountered during production . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . click Connect to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I pic@@ ks is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ tool tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture monitor allows you to view a selection of images and execute on them basic oper@@ ations such as screen@@ shots , zo@@ oming or exp@@ ulsion . the viewer can be used with short @-@ missing and mouse @-@ mouse . it has been designed for fast viewing and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in the full screen mode . this can be changed into window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the promotions , images in the JPEG format to save , without the usual losses on quality or metadata .
the consequence of the adjustment @-@ free storage is it the file size , because no compres@@ sing of the color information takes place . this can be found , for example , in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ O module Met@@ adata option currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import @-@ function of metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image file dialog with which you can copy the target dialog with which you want to copy the target file . the data will be copied after you put on the button OK .
this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please take a look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a range of images to a MPEG video in the form of a th@@ asch@@ a .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a basic audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Sli@@ deshow .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can start the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au for the module .
the images selected by you will then be shown under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the contents or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is ready to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ on or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one image will be displayed . the speed of the image will be shown below . a low value generates a very sudden appearance , a high , very smooth change of image .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can set under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the extension possible .
in case you specify an audio file under Name of audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences , you can now drink a coffee with the button code . depending on the speed of your host , you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a dip in the rest when you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the button settings right down .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or use the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ O module , you can import and convert your images to one of three formats of JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the head@@ lines tool d@@ Cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original z@@ apper of Him is : do not expect that it produces the same results as the software from your camera actors . sometimes you get with d@@ unt better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can continue to work on the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and save the conversion results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the ged image format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sy L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you &apos;re going to work your pictures frequently , or you should not use the JPEG format otherwise , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF , and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you choose JPEG as memory format , the metadata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start using the trigger button to start converting . if you want to cancel this process then you can inter@@ rupt .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier trial . a preview is not available as far as the conversion process is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to convert all pictures into an album . it uses the convert convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the time stamps .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . these are available four types of change :
proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : preparing the picture for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ i@@ ers . the target image , including background size , side size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
this K@@ IP@@ O module allows you to send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the associated pictures before . further pictures can be drawn on the list of the pictures and stored there .
after having started the module , the images can be shown with the pictures selected by you . clicking the button images can be added using a file optional dialog . for the last selected image will see a preview on the right pane .
you can also drag and drop images on the picture list and add it to the pictures to be added to the list .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of the pictures are removed .
once you have selected all pictures you can click with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the Bet@@ re@@ ff . the pictures selected by you are already attached to the app@@ endi@@ x .
be sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send lots of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and each time again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the correct path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments will be put together into a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF . they should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , searching for mistakes . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Connect , you can click this window .
after starting the Modul@@ s advanced di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to have shown your Sli@@ deshow . you can select here between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will use very elegant picture @-@ outputs by means of OpenGL . you must however own a proper graphics card , since otherwise the Sli@@ deshow will be very slow .
the file names will display , that the fil@@ ename of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . you can then run it manually with ES@@ C .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
del@@ aying between the images can be the temporary distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transfer effect . you should then check out the presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly choose from any transition between images to another effect .
during the Sli@@ deshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn it into the toolbar .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the preceding and the next picture and stop the de@@ w .
at the bottom left you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ O module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface .
this module is the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE labels .
once you have made your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each article is described .
when you press the mouse to the entry , change the browser &apos;s view . see picture .
when you select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of pictures displayed from a few thousand images to a few pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails in order to view the images of your method .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before its name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person an own preview picture , This also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
to view pictures next to the names , select the button which is in the right outside on the toolbar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords may be displayed ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) .
you need to specify yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you will have to select the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the pop @-@ up window you can customize the enlarge factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off .
if you access the search window in the main window , a dialog displays that the dialog for the determination of the image properties is similar . this dialog can look at the picture once more .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the pictures according to this text is searching for . if you want you can also be a date of the whole date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here is after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are m@@ apped .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :

launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu item &apos;s menu entry . as a result , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . one picture of this bar see you here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display multiple different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the body only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries Preview View from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will always be displayed in the Preview pane ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always shown the current date of the currently shown pictures if you navigate in the Preview View .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , thus pull the tim@@ eline . if you select one area , you will be shown in the Preview View only pictures of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in the following part of the user &apos;s manual ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the Settings menu .
before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first give the title of the bli@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer are also without description obvious . for example , that &apos;s all pictures are exported from a party . for example , note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain cases .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are clear why they are not received specifically .
bottom on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . by doing so , those who look at your website and possess a monitor which provides the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time . therefore , it can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as if he wants to get a picture larger than he wants to appear to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best to select all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for all of your HTML files .
first , you must select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible for the viewer . if you choose a URL for the basic folder after the pages are created , this folder will be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet located in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them manually . for the import function , see correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the basic sub@@ folders in which all sub@@ directories are located .
the currently described setting possibilities are all three based on basic sub@@ folders and URLs . in these cases , a sub@@ folder will be set , its name you can specify in output folder .
if you &apos;re at a family business , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you already have a lot of time to write the pictures , people on the pictures , att@@ aching , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even going to do .
with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import it into your database . the pictures are imported into your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images set aside and that file can pass so independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can edit a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a fold way . first , the images are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you are searching for creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following the dialog for the export of pictures is described , which you can use via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether you want to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices :
in the manuals near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , just choose the option Export file .
the last option of this page reads maximum picture size . if you want to send your friends pictures , the images might not be in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by telling for example , that each picture is to be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , will publish &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for imports consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import@@ ing images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the most imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database people . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog box , which categories are imported to imported file and which categories are specified in your database .
in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse pictures and to view : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this hand@@ book you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) to pass the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the Brow@@ se and prestige , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today it takes your videos . many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal securing tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically again . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , so you can launch &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , using the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
about the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can switch to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide , the different settings will be explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call up the thumb@@ nail options and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it has been described in you how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the sections , classes are already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete member@@ ships , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as stated in .
in view of the settings options available to you , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you will find the list of the current category and a list of the categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ O and means &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin Interface . find out about it on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules do have a help page that you can visit via the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested using &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using it on your own pictures . they should not say either about the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; from input \ &gt; or using the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage , if you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can use their images in albums : it &apos;s an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums so you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ;
so sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture gallery at the moment .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also had to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album of the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category people will use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so whether you have selected people and pass this on to the module .
since some modules are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog , and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other KDE application , see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will not see a lot of information , as you don &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will return to that window , then just click on the entry images that show you an overview of all available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to preview any picture with notes , where you see the picture , etc . you can set each picture either separately or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all images were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for Brow@@ se and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by selecting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can use them again and again , if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the moving of images within the list : if you have an example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , so you can move the people used upwards to find and assign the persons faster .
if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and customize these pictures with notes , just click on the buttons on the right and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item Vari@@ ous entries at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the image catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this article in alphabe@@ tical order .
you can move the individual elements of the dialog box by putting the bodies that form the edge of the frame , click and move on . you can also make your own window by moving outside the window .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your particular needs , click on the Settings button , click on the button below to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also drop a frame completely . if you want to get this window later again , use the button Options ... and here the window will see a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you choose to display images in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have filters . you can configure the thumb@@ nails by simply drag down the mouse with the middle mouse button . try again .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this picture is displayed in the picture above . if you haven &apos;t opened any window with a pic@@ ks , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture . just select the appropriate images you would like to delete and select either the R@@ emo@@ ve button or select Edit menu . now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; for pictures also use it without having saved on the hard drive . of course you have to record the pictures anywhere , so &amp; photo album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails will be displayed , so that the thumb@@ nails will show you . however , you can also view these pictures with the image above .
as you can see this function , that you would like to copy files from folders and then copy them again . if you would like to avoid the inser@@ tion of the corresponding CDs , please purchase a larger hard disk in order to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , see the pictures that you want to make for other in@@ accessible , and click Current viewing on Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that may view your little sister , con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ers and menu entry .
so you have set out which pictures are hidden in the case of the case . if you put the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will be locked down . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be inserted to un@@ lock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu privacy .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one of them , all images are stored on the hard disk and on the other hand , anyone who can read or delete the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to those who are using &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private pictures .
the reason why you can describe all of your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you manage and describe hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo album . you can preview them from the preview as described in .
the spect@@ ator you can see in see . it obviously shows the picture , but extra all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag and drop them differently . all these options are available after a right @-@ click menu . all these options are displayed below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were choosing people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by pressing the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a de@@ ath@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it &apos;s a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can enter the image in the image and zoom into it . with the minus button you can take a rectangle @-@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ator sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
keep in mind that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that can work with videos that are in @-@ off and zoom with the plus and the key .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you may have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the inter@@ rupt and configuration dialog of the picture to insert this name . you will perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and consider additional pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the chance to look at pictures with characteristics , while you look at it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the respective letter A , in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so , if you have selected all the images you want to edit . this is described in detail . then you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you just want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you want to display categories in d@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can press features to the images by pressing the text for the feature when the image was chosen . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted one . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; just switch on the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the folder you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully dominating the documentation , but the documentation too &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire model - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of a already selected object , since all sub@@ properties are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the item and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following switch @-@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
when you &apos;ve modified properties , click on to apply these changes . if you put invalid values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then you can click the input errors and then click on it or terminate the changes with abor@@ ting .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user Guide in the furnishings dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL Program Guide to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the House &apos;s View .
press preview in the self @-@ image opinion and a small sample of the scene is selected with the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting the entire texture is checked , even if you want to have a subordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for displ@@ ac@@ ement . you can change the shift through dra@@ gging with the mouse within the whole window .
each object has as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility levels are smaller or equal in the toolbar of selected visibility .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window assignment as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default window order or if you need a different order , you can set them in any form . you can also save multiple window frames and easily switch between different arrangements .
in order to anchor a window above or under a given view , drag the touch to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle shows the new position then .
to create a new column , drag the touch to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to re@@ arrange several views on one another , drag the touch in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tab@@ s top in the picture .
the last possible window parameters are floating views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to remove a view from anch@@ oring , drag the touch to the desktop or click on the little to the left top arrow in the fibre bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert extra views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sc@@ rolling , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view allows you to save window size ... Save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window of window under an existing or new name .
when you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders The symbol Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the returns in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ders a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can make any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of full models of highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in the View menu R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that allows the properties of the mode .
in the box card size you can list the width and height of the ro@@ b image . if you wish to ren@@ ame only a small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the image cut into the input fields .
in the bin@@ ations@@ field Quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ ders it . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex wor@@ user refle@@ x lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
when a picture is termin@@ ated with just one Stra@@ hl per pixel , various errors can be created . these images often do not show a fashion pattern or over@@ taking effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is always split and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray is pursuing a beam size . if the difference between the color values exceeds the neighboring pixels . if you set the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points are calculated , at a depth account of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the dy@@ es the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixels will be split into 4 sub@@ routines that are individually further followed and checked to further sub @-@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the low depth .
another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams ensure a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental capacity of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; which comp@@ uted diff@@ use Licht@@ re@@ flexi@@ on . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the related rays do not have an object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it &apos;s output . when &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; po@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command @-@ catching of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . when in the import messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree in the Editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the code text of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is ren@@ ched . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the self @-@ picture view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . here , the path to your documentation and the version will be supported . here , the versions 3,@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , altitude ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first @-@ found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display the selected objects .
the color for check@@ points . the second color is used for display the selected control points .
the color of the triangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
you can adjust the object @-@ catching of points to the R@@ aster menu in the context menu of the wire model . you can set here the R@@ aster separately for displ@@ ac@@ ement , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values make a more detailed wire model and thus a better switching for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed level of detail separately for two directions .
if you inter@@ sect the high detail results for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are used . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projection screens . this property yields a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
when you overlook the wall , a wall behind the objects is rounded . the wall is shown in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you indicate soil , a floor is located below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you activate cant@@ or re@@ por@@ ters , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window systems . in the window of window systems , the window of window systems can be explained and saved .
the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ feld Standard @-@ Window System : displays all existing window systems . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window assignment to start the program .
the list of existing window systems shows all existing window systems . a new arrangement can be added to the button Add button and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views of the chosen window Rules . new views can be created with the button Add and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with un@@ iting the window under the existing window , with card card , you get a box card together with the previous view and f@@ end the view not in the main window , but also generates a separate window .
so you have just got &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on a plane .
but you should carefully note the following warnings , before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black screen .
when you do not insert a light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black screen .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following display rules :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item processing . with this , you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the image properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user manual &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find out more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in view points can change with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button or press Enter , the wi@@ re@@ model angles and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is an aw@@ ful method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers actually a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then click the button or the input @-@ button . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be shown immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the level , even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends as far as the horizon .
when you look at the object tree accurately , you will notice that you click on the icon on the bottom . in this case , you will see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should post@@ p@@ one the ground for exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . choose the shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the picture view ( name = ground level ) , with one click on the button Preview will see how the pigment now looks like .
of course , the Preview of pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material , because you need to enter settings for the pigment , so remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest .
if you do not preview the ink at odds and then click on the button , then click the Preview button .
now the material for the floor is set right now . if you click on the icon with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color that you have expected . here are still other settings needed . in the color list , you need to edit two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently but the chess @-@ board list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree every@@ time and change the colors in the view of the Object characteristics :
this step you should already be able to perform just as you should understand the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should already understand the ball as easy as the ground :
in view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : at 1 ( do not forget to use the input le@@ ak or the button ( otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground to move a unit down .
of course , the rendering results in now a strange result : as before you see , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you chose the ball , you can assign it to a material now . as already at the bottom , type the ball a pigment as colour :
select First object and change the name for example in ball pigment . then click Ball pigment , select then einf@@ ale and set the values as follows :
but you can attain more complicated effects when you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click to apply or press Enter .
the settings gle@@ am effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med finishes , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you are &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you trac@@ ed a scene ray@@ trac@@ s , the ren@@ derer dis@@ ables from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect such as fog . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , each scene takes you , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have created a file .
whenever you open a new model or create a file , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
presents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage can be rejected .
this menu entry can only choose if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeated the last und@@ own command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used any other @-@ way .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to modify the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add a dialog with this option to edit or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove commands with this option tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove them .
a B@@ ump map is a way to manipul@@ ate smoking finishes without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a B@@ ump map and for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building stones : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object paint on pixel basis , by applying an image file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image classi@@ fier and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists the files you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ O ; or the key return .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in a separate window or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pushing return or Es@@ c ;
in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards tickets . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short rest for the display window and short rest for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the relevant window can be set .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display space is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already look at the next picture in the folder while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when opening the name of the recently opened folder . at the next time opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in window to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that just a few of the file types are displayed , which can represent the program also .
with this option for large images the display window is enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or using the selected image .
the time span between the image change at a slideshow . to change the value you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . is this value to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is thrown down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards shor@@ ts for the display window and short rest for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the un@@ used view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ presentation .
reduced the picture by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
closed the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browsing window is opened .
the image in original size display . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ re ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ re ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick picture processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and conduct correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; KDE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; make it as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all the information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you &apos;re a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then you would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may soon ask questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should not be powerful here .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; attempts to give you so much control over its work@@ flows . there are many options that can access the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to set up the Settings dialog , you have to switch between these settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure index should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . you can view them in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for the scan of images , which does not make any more than images to scan and storing .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images and storing images ; can open a dialog for each image to save a dialog , or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can let the images be saved in front of the file .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE Project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ ill@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner scanner and OK to open the scanner . cancel it becomes end &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite . quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
to view a picture , the user can start a preview can start and then start scanning area for the final scan . the pr@@ can can be started by the Preview button .
to better select the picture the user can get in the picture and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in so that the complete preview of the window fits into the window .
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when storing a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a showcase , as shown below is displayed . if saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and foil will lead to a departure and you get back into the main window .
through the button Settings the hom@@ onymous dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option should be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired then the option must be cancelled .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite ; pictures stores . dialog to save each image will open the dialogue in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite ; these automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save save without having a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the option save without a fil@@ ename , then this folder is saved as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is moreover the proposed name for image in a dialog to save . the automatically stored picture gets assigned a numerical sub @-@ mix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About begins the KDE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah ; used like all other programs of short@@ cut . below is a list of this cuts and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut you can set up by selecting the right mouse button in the Player window and select Glob@@ ale short@@ cuts you can set up by choosing the right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ cut .
you might be able to set up available multimedia buttons , that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other KDE programmes . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browsers , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist and scripts . such :
Amar@@ ok supports the head@@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ has still has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback , if the script should not be executed due to missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and take advantage of dialog , so that the user ID is not running .
begin at &quot; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will soon find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in every KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the out@@ run of external programs and commands . for this , the function Ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example of Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send al@@ erts on all current scripts . for this reason , string will constantly monitor the standard input of script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events when there is no use for it .
configure automatically displays the script to view the furnishings dialog . to store the store and loading of the furniture data , each script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ puts the working folder to the folder where all the data should be saved .
track@@ change is sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ COP functions to request further information to the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the denom@@ ination ) .
volume change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu @-@ title , contains the path to selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ titles are also handed over to remove the script to remove an individual entry . to remove an entry you d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok Script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ads , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to work for example . this includes the storing of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; b . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) ; for example the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right right .
the main kri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to the lad@@ ders should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ Parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; apply for your entry on KDE apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you just look for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ctive browser and fast search will find you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist is still hard for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and smart playlist automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generi@@ c USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used to listen to your music . these and yet many more useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ ist is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
usually , one has to enter the basic folder of Amar@@ o@@ &apos; sources the following : to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; KDE ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ka ; has like most applications , some options that you enable or disable it from the configure script via the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ ili@@ ent options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section System requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort on the furnishings of the furnishings . the dialog dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone .
player window will pop up the player window in addition to the playlist or off . when the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ ly . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
designing : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ ly . thus , the used colour scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
voting files at the music files are stored : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ ly . otherwise , the .@@ control files stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ o@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist that save the store , saves the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ads . please activate this option when you do not want to lose the current playlist if you do not lose the play@@ lists .
relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; relative paths to the music files , use from the storage location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored .
current piece by the piece changes visible , that the playlist windows open up / ab@@ rolls to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window .
switching to the context of the context switch automatically displays the context @-@ browser once the next piece is played .
in the section image you can customize &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone &apos;s image . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the fonts section , you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ads . you can use scripts for the following sections . you can select fonts for the following areas : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . press Enter ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of defined color scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ al of choice and can choose a separate color scheme . use this including the fourth colour selection for front and background color .
play by the start , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ unds ; after the program start the playback starts automatically with the piece on the place , with which it was stopped last .
the sub@@ window on screen screen set up allows you to switch the inser@@ tion of the OS@@ D . when on screen screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is shown and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ box shadow causes that the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OS@@ D colors for font and background . one click on the color spaces open the dialog to color selection . if own colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; KDE , colors will be used .
the input field display displays the text in the OS@@ D text . through the type of plac@@ ements , the OS@@ D can be customized to meet your needs . below you will find a list of available space owners and what they mean .
the option screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which the screen will appear on a multi @-@ monitor environment .
the cart@@ el card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate more settings in this map .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder that is supposed to browse through music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains links to the settings like with the selected folders .
sub@@ folders re@@ classification : these causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ in ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( such as music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection .
playlist : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection adds . the automatically added playlist will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part of the data base is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ feld driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further facilities in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l institution is used for inser@@ tion of the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone . on calcul@@ ator , the computer will enter , where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use username and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the cart@@ o@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah ; can submit the names of played pieces to an load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your load @-@ profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
unsubscribe pieces and thus update the profile : this attitude allows it to Amar@@ o@@ ah ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your load @-@ profile .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . for more information , please refer to the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen pictures .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package C@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so ( including the programs included ) , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts . we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D predi@@ ct that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ in on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can check the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the cap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , this is that day @-@ lib by reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all libraries were compiled by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok , but with GCC 3,@@ 3@@ x was compiled , then this leads to overthrow in Meta information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then you disable Autom@@ atically off when in@@ active for ... in the setup of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ ups by email ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a common crash , the error will be fixed .
this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to write met@@ a @-@ information , but this is not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 &#93; : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3 tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ thing : s symbols in the status bar ( random Mode / Re@@ petition / Dynamic playlist ) can be seen in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status de@@ activ@@ ates on grey and semi @-@ transparent . notice that in some cases , you must click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel . then please check whether Amar@@ o@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok is the right version first .
there are some options . most installation issues are ligh@@ test due to the help of an expert , your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or the developers . they use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ eno@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if something is ok by an error in Amar@@ o@@ ke itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music come there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window was converted into the Statistics window . you will find it under extras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , in the playlist , you must display the application column . click on the titles list of the playlist and select column show . you can also use the short command line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ K is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the out @-@ out menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let them fall , just as you would like it with other files . this is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to adding button , there is the button playlist store . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore you will find it via the menu bar under the extras of the E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that really really ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support pretty much every conceivable audio format .
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , bringing in the pres@@ et@@ ting no MP3 @-@ deco@@ ders ( for patented reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , ab@@ ab@@ outs
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos; s from : - )
when you use the g@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously write audio ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . please take a look at the assistance D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem of a problem and a solution . for g@@ Stre@@ ets you need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. : os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does not do &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded , you would just listen to a white noise . g@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be directly present to AL@@ SA , as well as X@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server operated with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( real @-@ time list ) and make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ pers is termin@@ ated SU@@ ID :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ X co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause their reproduction . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA @-@ furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts drivers , but instead install g@@ stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia completely to get the quicker arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the X@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix him .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing the G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all of the streams components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run G@@ ST regi@@ sters as a system administrator and once again as your normal user . delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register once again . now launch &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report it on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks D@@ COP is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and release with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets you start the playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;re awakened from the gentle tones of music that you &apos;re going to bed before going to bed .
how can I learn the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok , current title if one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used name Amar@@ o@@ player now
replace IP address with your IP and username user name with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa is available .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok , window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , changing window .
the combination of Str@@ g + Rights mouse button is a piece on the queue in queue . by pressing the input table after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search returned .

click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ O ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL @-@ support .
insert the CD , then click on playing the DVD menu with multiple folders . you can switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a par@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this will fit the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was performed . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece of yourself by clicking on a column version in the playlist window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece , like all other attributes , by clicking on the piece and edit : assessment or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog box .
the developers do not want to give you progress , when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not associated with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the General settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar and take the desired changes .

if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please see the latest versions . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ my and thus also a lot of error reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably became &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled before you have X@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine this output modules are not compiled . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not published . and now ?
probably you are using a distribution which is installed separately from the actual program . although g@@ stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you must now install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to re@@ compile X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ational , which is incompatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile g@@ stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ ational . one tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos; s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / MP4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to be able to play MP4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with g@@ stre@@ amer , must be installed alongside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ sten , even the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then execute the system administrator G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok to the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ( ... Audio output ) you enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intellectual 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug ) sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ inch &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the dialog dialog by X@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so lib will take care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual @-@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio @-@ issue with Arts is not further taken care of . you can of course take this issue yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can get the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the needed packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages over a package management system ( eg RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . however , a player window with the most important functions . additionally , one playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers that you can capture and search your whole music collection .
in this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ works will be used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your A @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a disk indication that displays the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the time of play , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this field changes the display of the already exp@@ ired season to the remaining time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analysis , even under the running indication . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the mouse button on the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running indication , there are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is enabled or de@@ activated the playlist window , while the button E@@ Q is used for setup E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audi@@ ts . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer you use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button E@@ Q in the Player window . once you mark the tick@@ ing field E@@ quali@@ zer is the E@@ quali@@ zer in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ works ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; KDE ; available multimedia player . she has many features that there is in no other player . but , do not deter@@ red from the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be split into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right you find the playlist themselves . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough .
the context @-@ browser displays different information regarding the current denom@@ ination . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser has three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later found in detail . they provide information about the current piece in each case .
if you already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; perhaps , you might ev@@ oked that the sub@@ window has fallen off . the information presented here are now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone . in addition , the information in the statistics window may be collected ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information on the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title the name of the song , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to copy the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . here you see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context @-@ browser , the cover images are supported in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats are treated .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display Cover paintings , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
beneath the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can adjust which information in the music window will be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last range , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it &apos;s checked and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the different fields to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button , and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist either .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded list text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text of the scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try the text for the piece from the internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the button editing allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok , collection database . this is no running text script necessary .
the button search opens a search for the light text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing performer - group@@ ed only the upper@@ most level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are left out of course .
group@@ ing performer / album - first , the pieces will be arranged according to interpre@@ ters , and below will see another division according to the respective album . if you want to see presentations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below different interpre@@ ters .
group interpreter / year - album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection will be sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first shown by genre , including according to artists .
group genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - this setting works just like the above , but additionally still is sorted according to the album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing according to expos@@ ing and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will change your collection automatically when you own something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
you can find a search filter directly under the toolbar as well as in the man@@ ure view . notes to the use of this filter you find in the section for the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . also , you can of course select your total collection , allowing the filter to be practically off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection Browser , you will get the following options .
download - This is the current playlist and adds selected pieces of the currently valid order in the currently valid order .
to attach playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
pieces in queue - This feature adds the selected pieces to queue for a long time . thus , you will be playing next .
as a playlist store ... - saves the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
on Media Player - Add the pieces in queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , please refer to the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ dies will be sent the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
metadata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) move files into tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears on different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing markings - changes as a comp@@ elling album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer appear under different interpre@@ ters but again with the interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser designed the handling of many play@@ lists simply . among other things he also contains Intel@@ ligent playlist .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlist . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the intelligent play@@ lists consists of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection which have never been played before .
even even provided Intel@@ ligent playlist are possible . click on the Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist . you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ads ; to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) ; in order to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ ns / i@@ pod is involved , you will have to find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t sorted in the top list of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop them on the list of performers . if you finish the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; and solve the drive coverage for your iPod .
under the toolbar you can search for a search field with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list , all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file &apos;s browser there is a address bar , which you can fetch music from a embedded URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can draw the music from there into the playlist and drop it .
when the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of the Shift lever can be difficult . in the case , the sti@@ cking of Shift lever can be useful : thus , falling files will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mas@@ position .
the playlist , all of you are fil@@ tered by you to play . you can edit the order by typ@@ ing the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them . over the playlist , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , you press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after inser@@ tion , all the search terms contain . if you enter e.g. one two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , it will include entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces found that one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to look for entries , the spaces contain , then join the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this way , after entries , Mike Old@@ field is included , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50@@ th This is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ tactic according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces , which are either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 have and not included the comment .
you can set the playback sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then get a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the toolbar of the playlist is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the button Add , with which you can add the playlist to the right . to the right , you will find play@@ lists , playlist and maturity M@@ alian .
next follow the kno@@ bs back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o changes to the playlist or re@@ vert back .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted using a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar button is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you will appear in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration setup .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example the controls and volume control . you can set the buttons set up by clicking on the menu and select toolbar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information to play@@ lists . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . also , the status of random Mode and restart , can be easily changed by clicking the mouse twice in the respective display area .
you can also specify the status bar and select the status bar in the respective settings .
the context menu is accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist by clicking on this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ aliz@@ ations . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry , a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone .
the Cover administration is a useful tools for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can see all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what to be displayed in the Cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big fall in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play , 1 is played first , 2 as a second , and so on .
the maintenance of the queue will open you through extras @-@ long administration . if you want to add a piece of the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already presented ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing other random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load @-@ profile to this dynamic playlist .
just click on the desired playlist , drag them to the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Upload . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist so under your circumstances !
the two proposed modes of random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start the playback directly . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece of your collection . the recommended pieces are added at least one piece by your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
when you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be de@@ activated once again .
the button Re@@ fill the current playlist and adds new pieces corresponding to the dynamic mode . playlist will open the dialog for editing play@@ lists and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the possibility to click Edit . then the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the adjustment for coming pieces will be passed over and they will be in this playlist no piece double . if the setting is active , the pieces already played under consideration the hi@@ ght songs are removed .
gesture pieces - this is the number of played pieces which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces they have recently been played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist by each player . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlist or smart playlist ( if you want several play@@ lists , will add &amp; Amar@@ o@@ thing pieces from each of the crossed playlist .
some scripts enable own settings . you can customize settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok , script , by installing it on the script . after you install the script , a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button more scripts .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script and then un@@ install it .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see the scripts by scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugins is used for the activation of available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ zone . the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps to create an audio CD . to complete the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other lu@@ te compressed formats then keep in mind that you get ready to get a bad quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project on CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog box you can do anything . wait , until the calcul@@ ator has concluded the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom .
for copying an data CD , please choose extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
once you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start . you will now see a dialogue of the same or something similar :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy . as soon as the reading of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium upon which the data is burned down .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also disk @-@ at once @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a ly@@ rical description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and expanding these functions even . therefore , select &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs out . in some cases it gains &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the internet , such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for dealing with audio data stream . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is available in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial entity . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code co@@ de@@ c for obsol@@ ete audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , m@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning them afterwards on an audio CD .
so@@ x : a relief program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the function of fully @-@ equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for creating a mix@@ er CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different seals of the various albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces differ differently according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start the CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already saved once , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s Dialog Store is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would be able to save for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project is altered and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then dis@@ closing between store and changes . in addition , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will inqu@@ ire for any set project what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ supported project will be asked what to happen so as if you had called the closing .
when you call this entry , you can select about the appearing dialog files for adding a project . this has the same effect as if you &apos;re using the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn into the project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described about the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . he is prompted to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders using existing files .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function prompted &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , they only ends the previously imported files back .
opens the copying @-@ copying dialog . this also allows copying the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively you can also just want to burn an image of a CD , which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of the K@@ lon@@ ens instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows to create a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also want to burn just an image of a DVD which will then burn you later . besides , there &apos;s also the possibility of converting a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data from the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog queries for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not currently supported , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog queries for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously illuminated DVD Video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used as single @-@ standing . it contains information about the output video , code settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and the cut black edges .
displays information about the attached medium . this information is displayed in the table and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
spl@@ itting the folder view or off . the folder view provides an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is activated , its contents are displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locking and block of running or dis@@ ing of the medium .
divi@@ des the table view or off . the table view allows you to select and drag files into the screen view . the table view is also the interface for viewing audio or video CDs , provided a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
spl@@ itting the head@@ line in the screen view or out . the head bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer section that is only visible when the project view open open projects . the head bar does not contain a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining opinions .
this will open a dialog window to modify the keyboard regulations for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; once you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the button order for them below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture wizard . this allows the correct permission to set to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights is required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can see general Program@@ mes . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and for the fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the instruction program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional design , therefore more your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which of the contained programs you give preference .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that all &amp; KDE ; -@@ program measured , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ News Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ C@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ a project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ a project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ a project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ a project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ f ( ) to D@@ COP@@ re@@ f ( ) to D@@ COP@@ re@@ f ( ) to D@@ COP@@ re@@ f ( ) to D@@ COP@@ re@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) , gar@@ an@@ as@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) of the bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l ) of the Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ re@@ ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ ate can be obtained a project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project through K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
cre@@ ate@@ urs ( Q@@ String name ) with cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) makes for add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Path ) , jo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) , Wi@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) , offset Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String fluid )
this makes it possible to complete a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ K@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ a les@@ er for &amp; KDE ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many codes ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( compres@@ sor free compression ) will still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . further codes can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read , read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( lu@@ te @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually a pro title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the lu@@ lu@@ ous FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ins ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to compile it . however , only the codi@@ fier packages are installed to be needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
what enco@@ ding / file format is intended to use ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a little introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word of copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the CD ; / DVD device is intended to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not b@@ yp@@ ass the mechanisms of copying protection . just avoid the purchase of cop@@ ing audio CD ; s !
while the setup dialog must be made ( the furniture dialog can be found but as often called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the slim approach of the interface , which will be frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , all manually captured .
this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots , with descriptions of the tab@@ s tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request from the CD@@ DB request corresponding to the set up of request in the CD@@ DB &apos;s tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder has been configured in the Ko@@ di@@ sequ@@ ent tab in the furnishings - enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read as default with a different en@@ coder . it is noted that before the en@@ coder has been configured in the configuration dialog box .
opens the file manager , allowing an already selected file to code is selected instead a full &amp; CD .
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cards cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . so , you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter outlines sound quality , radi@@ ators and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a lu@@ cent audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any other commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information caused by data compres@@ sing according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at low bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still available with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG , slightly deeper quality at low bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a machine based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG subscri@@ bers is present .
MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &quot; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces accepted transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car models . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that can be fet@@ ched manually or replaced by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / be used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program for creating the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the code and this parameter here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches to these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le to the key@@ word ( English : day ) , when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result is as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ ck @-@ name in the assistant ) :
that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs to enter the information by yourself . it is noted that here only by text is said : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the landlord : so that the author is meant ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; any information can neither be added to the artist nor the music company . all the information can be obtained in case of a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively an inter@@ rupt field ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address can not be used by the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB will be used , the geo@@ graphically will be used on the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually issued monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which les@@ bian program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that are used c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , look in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD . see , considering that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the suitable distribution must be installed first if this has not yet been done .
the storing of the WAV files can be selected by the codi@@ fier and therefore the desired file format . at first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a lu@@ cent free compression for audio data ) on the tab of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution , before the codi@@ fier is required . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter World Teacher .
after installing a cook@@ er , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . in this case , &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check out the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the ty@@ pe@@ - and read@@ just on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio code of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas what you want exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your machine . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software . at least , it is not necessary to compile source files , whatever you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you try to possess it ( eg . by trying to copy something inside the Con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for every extingu@@ ishing &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ding codi@@ fier to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy , we divide the program using the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read them on every reading of a &amp; CD , if the appropriate settings are found .
the device designation is handed over to the les@@ bian program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device designation . if this is not working or when more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is available , can also be accessed by the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General settings . here you can not do much . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything will be shown / typ@@ ed as in the scre@@ enshot .
only in case of complete information inqu@@ ire , so you will be informed if data is missing from the indications of keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet Explorer &amp; CD ; to connect to the Internet , so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry will immediately start reading the &amp; CD . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ ename or fil@@ ename will change with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; day .
aside from this example , if you want to manually enter it : if you do not want to manually enter it . you can use free@@ DB locally in the offline mode if you choose to use the database before . however , these two choices have to be selected , at least the first one . the mode will be set up on the following cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ DB . put everything in the scre@@ enshot now .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will function as a first attempt to work .
both function in@@ compar@@ ably what the server regards , as there are many fire@@ walls to bo@@ unce the protocol of 88@@ 80 , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to send a CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ field should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously tap@@ ing pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try ourselves .
CD ; after reading the last piece : please tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you want this tick@@ ed , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files is available . if the field is not attached , the files in the private folder will not be created . don &apos;t forget to make this folder if you want to make yourself something with the WAV files .
all just enter as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something needs to be kept right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the compression rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it is trying to bo@@ de more than a WAV file at the same time .
that is it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated this configuration is used as default for every reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described as the process of les@@ ens the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . first , the folder structure , the way the music is built on the hard disk , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described here must be repeated for every extingu@@ ishing &amp; CD .
since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screen@@ shots will see a little different from those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully deleted from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of taking it from the internet . comments will point out to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done so now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD has been identified ; can be identified as audio CD and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you search in the section questions and answers for help or go back to the previous section regarding the settings .
note : if the &amp; CD was removed from the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already completed , and the name of the artist and album are also shown .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry in which your opinion is best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have selected the cross@@ fire for the automatic retri@@ eval of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger it by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you have no local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; News title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into the input field &apos; News title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ m@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can &apos;t just start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all the words with large letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tag , you have an unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ set settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the files later on with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the Help for the code in order to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the item &apos;s fields . give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered the front data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB alone . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album can be displayed about the unit list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each row of a piece . only the titles which are so marked will be read . simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button to read selection out of the les@@ bian process , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what proceeds .
click on the tab assignments to switch on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently displayed on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder of the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the les@@ out of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece out , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . hence , read and code parallel . notice the status of the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not find a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes to read and code . when high @-@ performance machines is the result is unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous outputs and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will today conver@@ se within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the Legal Media package , but most distri@@ butions have already included a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for help as the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first time of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( above all , when at the time of program starts not an audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu out ?
what does it go ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; therefore who can always do something useful or change it . if you read it . at least immediately after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has agreed that section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange when it succeeded in bringing the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; KDE ; in addition to others he has not high@@ lighting some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players did not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; KDE ; support also support &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ at proj@@ ectors that are needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encing .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move in &amp; KDE ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on the ridge .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( songs or text stores ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you &amp; KDE ; while playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can choose the song you want .
you can also drop a file of one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the toolbar , select the entry play from the menu item or press the id@@ ols .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you drag it to the &amp; mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces you will be added to a collection and then played on each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller .
when you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows left and right of Tem@@ po@@ indication and then change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ on LCD .
the id@@ ols has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the id@@ ols like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry break in the menu piece , so breaks the playback . pressing the id@@ ols while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored on two species in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use li@@ ed@@ t@@ ability and again others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out which events are to be displayed , and even better : the event type will automatically determine which a song is used , so you don &apos;t have to set up the kar@@ ao@@ ke text automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other species .
if you want to define an event type , select from the menu Set@@ ting the entries text events or songs events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these will be played in the row . in this section , how you can make collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then set the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the threads in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you quit the application this collection will not be saved . concern that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which you can choose the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding is activated for the collection , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) are automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click removal .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu button sequence of the menu , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list of the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump one song further , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or push the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the item previous piece from the menu item or push the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select there the collection and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it is saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Typ@@ ical Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI Map because all Sound@@ boards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI interface is a text file containing all required compositions for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of an section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and neither line any line for any of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the notes that need this instrument to place the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board is not supported by a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , which is similar to a gun bag . to do so , carry the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
if so , a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun bag ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Dru@@ el patch the patch is meant that each tone is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) rather represents the one in which the tone means the sound height of the same drum ( like him own key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how t@@ notes is shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MA@@ P paragraph , the order of lines is very important , just as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used above all to t@@ notes tones on the per@@ k channel . take a look at the supplied Key@@ board as an example .
this section may be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel exp@@ ires , simply do it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion to a particular channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the N website . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is required to use the name Name for this channel . if you want to use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , then Patch x is used .
the Option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k fold patch on the per@@ k mail channel .
the value for pitch ratio is shown in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ nam@@ ing events can be multiplied by the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to be no dec@@ imal number in the map file .
this setting is used because GM announces that a keyboard , which is to play a keyboard , which is to play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher to play . unfortunately , however , try to find some key@@ boards up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI interface , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel screen is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ ds you see which sounds are currently playing .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button does not shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the se@@ wer view has ( until now ) two different views to display the players &apos; notes . the view select Settings under the point of view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the speed , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I cannot force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compres@@ sive ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ders ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; which happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ te LCD , in order to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop feature a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or want to play a file , just into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file fast without adding to a collection , turn off the setting automatic adding to the collection and the new ; file is added to a temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open a temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do not escape , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me that , continue to &amp; n@@ mid .
&amp; A@@ mid ; was edited by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; at the moment I am not much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files make music and phrases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ap@@ is@@ .@@ es
they really make me a huge relief if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me because I might already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and did not swe@@ pt any money for it . I &apos;d like to emphas@@ ise that I can only continue to program because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - S@@ culp@@ ture of the error , that the pitch @-@ height at A@@ we @-@ cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition to this may be &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage which is under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ lar@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , find information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to any music .
in case of any problem , contact one of the &amp; KDE ; mailing lists or send a message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files created by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet termin@@ ated as &amp; KDE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the KDE website on new versions , or to send the question to The &amp; KDE ; user mailing list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ est@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information to reproduce .
it is possible to save the preferred compounds under the menu book@@ marks , but this is individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of thum@@ bs .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , TV and perman@@ ence playlist may also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not going through an editor , but also by applying itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ pping from the menu , and as next editing mode . by the cli@@ pping of a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu , and select either the box mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the inser@@ tion mode is left or another group selected without the playlist of it .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at start@@ up and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ bit option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will consider the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at start@@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , however the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite picture : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; file : / / / / / / / / / / / co@@ il ; and lt ; / co@@ il ; and lt ; / co@@ il ; are in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be re@@ printed in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the MI@@ ME @-@ type A / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings dialog from KDE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for messages regarding the loading of the Browser module library . if no error occurred , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end for a particular MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should be re@@ used to all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner is used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recruitment ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably included a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one the only works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux will be functional for the X server ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) to be included in this configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internal players are used for different names for different sources . at the time of creation this documentation , this dv@@ d source , dv@@ d source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when they are activated , they begin with the play@@ lists of play@@ lists .
are there indications like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play by him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the user root to execute the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time to check X@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; required .
L@@ atex ; : a professional fonts application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably applied to the package &amp; texts ; or &amp; Driver ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution / installation CD / DVD should be produced .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; the project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the ki@@ le ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; L@@ atex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions concerning the documentation is taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is needed , the contact should be made via the ki@@ ah website .
if you have any questions or res@@ ili@@ ating at comp@@ iling from &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; -@@ environment for the use of all &amp; L@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within these simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to these . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to experience should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapters work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the correct answer : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . W@@ Ã ¤ end the ur@@ inary &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English . lay ) &amp; L@@ atex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
if only a good idea to &amp; l@@ atex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book to it . to be able to control good volumes , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; L@@ atex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ ely .
just as other sig@@ nat@@ ories includes &amp; L@@ atex ; an introduction to be defined with the general characteristics such as paper format , side@@ numbered and text messages , as well as a comparison with the text \ \ Start { document } , and must be closed again with the command \ \ Start { document } .
the quick entry @-@ entry wizard of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a very nice function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ s ) provides some options for creating the document . it also enables some options to be made to document related settings .
document classes : this is hereby chosen to use the form of the document ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; tab@@ lo@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; be@@ ech &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
enco@@ ding : hereby the drawing co@@ ding is set . modern systems will increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for integration , they are only used in the cross@@ fire .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN requirements ) .
new user does not have to worry about now . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information about this in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; it is because you have noticed that any mathematical environment is not closed . you hate it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will be saved through the high@@ lighting time and time .
with automatic adjustment of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically ( for example \ \ by { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated ( e.g. \ \ by { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; L@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most magical and more subtle element ) :
in view of the document in the structural screen the individual elements can be viewed by mouse @-@ click on the respective icon and viewed .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be created very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; as soon as a DVI , file &#91; straight is &#93; created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in the bed &amp; l@@ atex ; code text .
a DVI , file contained a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the original output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ atex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and straight .
when using the R@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ts@@ ky , the elements of the DVI ; file was clicked with the editor , and as soon as it was clicked on an element in the DVI , file is clicked , becomes the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; L@@ atex ; code text was clicked , becomes the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master &apos;s document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master &apos;s document the work is simplified with other incorporated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set into project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; L@@ atex ; code text is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no mistakes in the source code ) .
file course : in this mode the DVI , -@@ file on the cor@@ ds may be repeated , and it is not a call of &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation .
for viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection of boxes should be fin@@ alized . the selection fields were designed for fast inser@@ tion of joint elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast struc@@ turing of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The verb@@ ally &amp; L@@ atex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Further is for the introduc@@ tory of articles such as tags , joints , notes or references . the possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection among a selection box ) .
when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ h ; from hand to be written .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ ass . it can be used for specifying the writing . it can be made the fonts for the main text , the fox of notes etc. set . there are the following letters to be made :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available for preparation : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document art and restri@@ cting settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand to hand .
the brack@@ ets following the command \ \ Docum@@ entary class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . the fonts may not be fixed at the beginning , this may also occur later in the text .
once the above source code was typ@@ ed , the &amp; L@@ atex ; -@@ source code will be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or of the button quick .
the source code must be saved in front of the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; apply the storage automatically .
slaughter the comp@@ iling of the document should be searched in logging of errors . when using quick installation , &amp; Ok@@ ular ; automatically started . this is not the case , should likewise be noticed .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text , which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font should have been created and only a few mer@@ ciful should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } sublime . the order \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } er@@ m@@ apped .
results are permitted only within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) ber@@ ed . there is no description ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many options to brigh@@ ten the read@@ ability of read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , fat pressure , c@@ unning , etc . these commands may end either by command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for tru@@ sive @-@ pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be noted with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ rating : creates a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
once the background is represented by writing the source code with the &amp; L@@ atex ; conversion language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le .
once a bit text was typ@@ ed in the assistant should a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . there should be a quote , a few places in the fat and Kur@@ si@@ v@@ print and a poem can come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed can be returned to the editor via editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E ( with the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI , file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an inherent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ings@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen TV@@ s .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document . ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document using Dru@@ cken ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI , -@@ file has been created from the &amp; L@@ atex ; source code , the transformation can start into curved other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the anticip@@ ation look for the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; l@@ atex files . this includes only modern under settings Ki@@ le set up ... tools construction .
to apply the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a line of the source code and then be clicked on preview . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; the viewer takes place immediately .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; it must be laid down ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; ( settings oc@@ ular setup ... Editor )
should the use of quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewers will not allow you to appear a mistake . should a mistake occur , this will be in the log file or in the message window in summary .
the recording file lists the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then use the kno@@ ck @-@ like La@@ Te@@ X bugs and nests between the errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the logging line and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once upon the corresponding button on the toolbar button appears , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the features provided are :
for selecting a le@@ ak document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
distributors of &amp; L@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates houses in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file accessed or create a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using a document of an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using a file new , some strings can be replaced by other data ( such as name or text enco@@ ding ) . these variables may be configured in Settings box .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering documentary class . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ entary &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the exec@@ uting of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document then your own template can be eliminated instead of the default size .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described under described steps .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be made out in the menu tools directly out &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can go there directly with reading the chapters work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be accessed through the menu La@@ Te@@ X @-@ reference , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button to w@@ ander the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way by clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ s , only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated conversion , some parts of the source code can be washed out in the editing window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibilities to browse the most different types of sources , and to emphas@@ ise it . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands of the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants would be able to use some book@@ marks inside the text . this is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu entry into te@@ asing or the last jump is highlighted , so that it is automatically reflected in the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent features have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source code ; speci@@ fies their selection . under editing chairs the following commands are included in the text selection :
coat a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph it does not mean a text with perme@@ ating rows ( like in other Tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this enhanced meaning may not be shown with tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the precip@@ itation separated by two blank lines are separated .
choose the word below the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has a l@@ atex ; commands with a wider star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) .
for example , a part of the document may be exp@@ elled at this first and by wir@@ es of the key can be removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the keyboard navigation device . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the following commands for a faster result . among Edit removal are the following commands to include the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of any type of sale .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for N@@ F further commands under editing surroundings for an exceptional working with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command the cursor moves to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to pad the environment .
with this command you can inj@@ ections to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed just behind the command to the gravel of the environment .
if the cursor is located prior to or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , is inj@@ ected at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many dev@@ oured environment commands may be lost quickly to the review , that command will close the last fired environment , so that the dev@@ oured environment structure will not be scattered .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . at Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands to match to those from edit .
with this command this command will move to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ated cl@@ amp .
this command will move to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly close cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ated cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located , the other end of the group moves ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many dev@@ oured groups , par@@ enth@@ r@@ ents can quickly be lost during the review . this command will close the last group , so the wast@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups do not sc@@ aled .
in &amp; L@@ atex ; two simple attachment ( for example ) is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two ease of application is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and accommodate two asleep or l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double application characters can be used under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French application form . there are also many other languages available .
when the she@@ et@@ aste of Shift ; input @-@ tas@@ ked &amp; ki@@ le ; if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line @-@ break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment close &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a decent Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ erup@@ tion .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be called under Settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users need to classi@@ fy the columns in tables and with all the E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; is trying to create it ; after the te@@ aring t@@ all@@ ard in the following line . even though this t@@ aller is not the column , led &amp; ki@@ le ; some inter@@ space for the columns position of the current post@@ ulators .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code con@@ duction , this in &amp; ki@@ h ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still extended . these are three to need and the other two are for automatic shut@@ down . all these modes can be set for different working methods under settings Ki@@ le set up ... Ex@@ press@@ ors .
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
in the sn@@ ap of the R@@ Ã ¼ ck the last letter is removed and enables the complete list of data to be removed . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , descriptions are of course made by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping brands will be folded , so that a just jump to these positions can be found by editing the cap@@ tiv@@ ates N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste diving brand and can then be accessed .

the instruction mode is essential for the execution of environments not normally . there are always a couple of letters with \ \ begin typ@@ ing . on the other hand , the environments we often use that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the utilisation of the environments to be made .
when calling the full @-@ to @-@ edit environment or the keyboard slide , the command is automatically compiled into the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient obstru@@ ction appears to be performed in the simplest way and by means of entering the input holes are finished .

the 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . all these tools use compres@@ sor as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ l as a base . the combination leads fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; KDE , knows me pro@@ c and how over@@ ra@@ ging it . if we still lift it a piece , we give him a graphical surface ! no longer click on a terminal , simply click on a terminal processor ; simply click on the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is located in the selected working directory , then remove the current working directory . if not , then remove the selection of current files and enter it in the field of other folders to the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time , if said pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who worked at the &amp; KDE ; documentation already has worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book , then just leave the current directory folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book will be found .
when it comes to a output on the screen , its file is flaw@@ ed . please check the reported mistakes and try again .
if the veri@@ fiable file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; then they let the file simply be added . if not , delete it at current file , select the tick and select the file by using another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , they click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
for use a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; stated in the &amp; XML ; file , they select &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; and XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the working file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is already marked , then it simply leave the file to be selected . if not , remove the selection of the file and select the file to be processed by using the other file file selection .
enter the name of the file , as the result is to be named , and the file is normally stored in its own root folder .
the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; even perhaps little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can get rid of the additional functionality immediately and you don &apos;t have to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it further down .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin with the Edit menu Edit . so the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and adding new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a storage location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the seeking of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationships are each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member may have several roles in the project like both team managers and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and replace the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text .
nick@@ name and the setting of their own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information about the team managers if something happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later someone has saved it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it becomes added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page &apos;s configuration , the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project preferences Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address given in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
note are special comments in the documents . you can distinguish themselves from normal comments by following things :
to give ann@@ ot@@ ations is simple . either the note -@@ entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by a description text .
any remarks can be sent a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Spitz@@ er ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leaders Head sub@@ project leaders should be introduced to the respective divisions or sub@@ project names , as described in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ ups , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the comment invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , the D@@ T@@ D diagnostic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here only talk about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called up via Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are handled in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , including tags , including car complete can be changed . the entries are :
large / sh@@ ell@@ ation of tags : large / small @-@ writing of automatically insert tags . normal Groß / Mini @-@ write means the tags are inserted as inserted in the tag XML files .
large / Mini @-@ type of attributes : big / s@@ cription of automatically captured attributes . normal Groß / Mini @-@ writing means the attributes are inserted as inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if asp@@ al@@ act , is available for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
starting and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during inser@@ ting .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using the Standard button you can playback the default pres@@ ets .
standard Dia enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other respects as with file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting is de@@ activated from the same into the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . this option here will be broadcast by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul regularly created backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash in the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for even stored documents , a backup is updated regularly , according to the time issued .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
put the window settings on the default back to the next start is useful when the interface through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on opinions through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning response area provides the taxes of the possibility to check the notification of warnings by read@@ sheets of no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ No@@ des in the document , to be adjusted in detail .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action makes it possible to change the action by clicking the structural engine with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural @-@ design settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ aliz@@ ations of the tree in editing and how deep in changing the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which the current document no element has been found .
the area to start fixed by abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ( a type of templates ) which can be sub@@ divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s means it can be a valid group for PHP , which means the i@@ f@@ using abbrevi@@ ation something else is valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified :
address : the path to plugin , if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information will be passed to the plugin start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; read @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied boarding . only read @-@ it &apos;s Parts we refuse to charge if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; whether the entered information is correct . off , the storing of the entry is also available when the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting function was completely newly developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the db@@ g Debug@@ ger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plugins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ire .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a fitting de@@ bu@@ gger plug in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger Plugin , the specific settings may be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; user interface :
a view where the contents of monitored variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed . appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ gement . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which has a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally do not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the bu@@ ds to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to submit a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and updates on the monitoring of the script as well as the currently fixed line . if this happens during the script , the execution continued . happens before a debit requirement was started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information to o@@ vers@@ ed variables and the current line number . if this happens during a script running the execution continues . happens before a debit requirement was given , the execution begins as soon as an requirement is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next statement in the script , without entering the functions or In@@ clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next statement in the script , with it being possible in functions and In@@ clu@@ des in .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next one , as if there was the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variation @-@ view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia , adapt to your needs and how you can be inter@@ ant@@ ap@@ ulted , better to become better .
docum@@ ent@@ ty@@ p Edi@@ table packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , to provide support for market and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes up of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ ging . foot@@ prints are hand@@ some , symbolic mut@@ ations of image valves ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , which insert the text and instructions quicker into a document than a user vary .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see fit for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . toolbar allow a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . they only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the call@@ out language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ 13 )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as the only element type themselves nothing else .
the type of the tags is a script function . when you use &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for day @-@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an unprecedented attribute and the attributes within this tags may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag determines . this is a just element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it contains the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags , which should be displayed , as this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; this is a just element type element .
gives the source code used for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ code name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are transferred to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags inside a dialog window . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once ( for example , once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the defined day tags . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that finish a day . this item is an just element type .
all of the Tag@@ XML files must start with an XML ; -@@ declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed tidy .
spaces do nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently un@@ available . currently , the check only takes place while downloading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia .
in the following one example of a family 1 of the XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt : diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag Name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ ings D@@ T@@ D settings . for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can specify with settings actions ... click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action weigh@@ ted keyboard short@@ cuts . by clicking the User Database can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cuts can be removed .
the simplest actions . there can be a text in the determin@@ ated settings , and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the migh@@ ti@@ est action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . ourselves are the Quick start dialogue or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file is removed : / out of the document name .
% P@@ ID : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods you can accept a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; in the default input . in the selection field , you can be determined what to send to the standard input . options are :
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
according to the input also the output of the performed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output posted on the standard version . error messages posted on the standard version of the output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written on the Standard edition , using the value shown in the selection field :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar using the name of the market .
once a toolbar has been added , you must add and configure promotions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the fitting toolbar .
complete everything and , in case the tag Attri@@ bute has and you can plan their use , enable dialog &quot; to edit &quot; tag if available , so that an entry when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ ored ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the menu @-@ bar ; , graphic Further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting kno@@ b as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is usually seen as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled , that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ Day in the current document will fit .
after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this will pass through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
click the use button and continue with other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies ; functions to the toolbar icons , or it should adjust this to a better overview through some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar settings with the toolbar . set sure that the desired material toolbar can be selected .
I would like to choose the separ@@ ator ( from top left ) for my toolbar . after the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar button , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to get access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note , as separ@@ ators aid the group@@ ing . anyone who knows my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new toolbar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . once Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , there will be im@@ part sub@@ folders , but your toolbar button ( n ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ repository if somebody has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search a existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then you let the first part let you , the second we treat you here .
# KDE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = 4.@@ 1.@@ html Day 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html Day 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html 2 =
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see the documentation now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like this :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Version of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = i@@ vo@@ x.@@ html = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tactic .@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the shaft sti@@ ff ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try out it yourself .
you notice that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential at the top end of the man@@ ure &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders displayed ! ) .
spaces do nothing , but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource @-@ files are replaced .
the table section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is designed for the design of the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of supported separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; -@@ community . they will not be rich of it but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
you are not alone . it is possible to share the twi@@ sting resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is one by e @-@ mail menu entry , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the following menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and usable for publication . to ensure that there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the subsequent users .
when you upload , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can choose a . in the dialog New resource you need to stay empty ) and by clicking the OK button will be started .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload the toolbar button and began in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it can be broken and then it can be broken down . please note the warning messages and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , but it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files will be necessary in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D Download and Convert a D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description that is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string , which is made in the ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / re@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; after converting the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to understand full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; this chapter is trying to get familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; rewarding .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the work@@ space is divided into three parts : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
global elements are available for everyone , who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , which is checked as globally , stored in the common folder structure of &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; this enables the group of administrators of different work@@ stations , actions and patterns in the global tree will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS , patterns to work@@ stations specially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the Edi@@ ei@@ re@@ on@@ ites with information and the toolbar . please see , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the cardboard boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document password , such as close the current , other or all tab@@ s , re@@ vo@@ ke , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in Edi@@ tor@@ area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document file , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / insert ) , processing of under the mouse @-@ cursor keys , help to the word under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file , when the string is referred to a file under the mouse @-@ cursor .
at the top end of the editing window , the toolbar of Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional as standard is shown for the one set of toolbar cameras . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the toolbar are adapted to the new functions and associated users needs .
the use of toolbar button is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , such as &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day . should they have a day that has several attributes ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the man@@ ic views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and pass through information ; in the representation of Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ on@@ ites are available for files , project , templates , documentation , attributes , and documentation of buildings .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by means of a right mouse @-@ click . actions like Ad@@ ding , removal , loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be performed with the context menu displayed .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what kind of connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only applicable to the respective users and templates projects are only available in the project . more on templates will be found .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button are available , such as the script to start , edit or send it by e @-@ mail .
with this view you view the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set in the document on the position of the item . by right @-@ clicking it opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it can be varied attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . based on the content of the information system , the change of all available attributes allows you to modify all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development . you can download the packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies ; &apos; documentation site you can create , and by adding a Ord@@ inary doc to a project can conform to project @-@ specific documentation , to be edited and viewed .
by default , it has two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , via the beneficial information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are shown .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , extensively expanded and easy to understand . indicate a symbol and they get the respective command displayed . the Chocolate cabinet of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is the ability to send a toolbar with enam@@ el . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; and if they receive a toolbar in an e @-@ mail , they can assure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; like any other you can backup and load it !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; it has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help enter . the options are easy to understand and here not executed .
if you have trouble passing urine , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 am folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in the PA@@ TH is in front of their bin folder . same thing applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , was optimized for a quick web development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul had to deal with an obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done .
no longer on re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ingly ; well , it is far along the road to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ise : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should be patient , then be the suitable &amp; IDE ; to be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above requirements need to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; KDE ; developer community is based on the idea of free software , the idea of why develop , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; so to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows you to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . through the program comp@@ elling them , they can wi@@ den &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , without having to remember any scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more about it is found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and Related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information about the documentation is done with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or rip @-@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file which is not located , where the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check out the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ placement , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting out of the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sc@@ oping , so that it is displayed correctly and will not be mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting reference .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ closing , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day used .
enables the block selection , or off . that allows you to select boxes with the help of &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be found !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education and training of the problem of problem on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ inger ; the problem @-@ re@@ porter is activated once you change the structural tree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window . this column allows you to put the book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries or next to be next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects are saved with the file name .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. , to copy video files into your sub@@ folder or sub@@ folder and add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have been assigned to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . these actions will only be saved . actions must be saved through settings of actions ... toolbar . toolbar can be saved in the toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbar .
re@@ moves a toolbar from the field of view . it does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ gia ; team to make the toolbar available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server , wherever any other can access it . see in .
loading one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that has done you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; own description @-@ format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are supposed to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a ty@@ pe@@ tion in the global KDE folder is not present , fails to charge the store .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently invited materials . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar can be loaded , there are in the Tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul refused , if this day talks to the rules on this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menus listed above . click on the index of a registered plug @-@ in .
sel@@ ects the syn@@ tactic mode for the current file . the list of available hang@@ ers Schem@@ ata depends on the k@@ ata version .
sel@@ ects the type of line ID . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by means of the external application tidy .
immediate envel@@ ope between the different types of the interface . through some restrictions in the KDE @-@ libraries may result the switch @-@ off sometimes time or create unnecessary graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu has an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables viewing of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog include any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers .
set the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or add and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul &apos;s development in financial terms , find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , such as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you get the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets you empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected logs can be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation may be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and by default templates . if a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard should be set .
this is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard should be set .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in a server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if files , which are to be part of the project somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is planned from scratch , not an@@ a@@ aken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this option all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of cou@@ ps .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the latest screen of the new project wizard provides three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project properties in the sub@@ window , or using the short@@ cuts shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the Project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be re@@ inde@@ xed for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the view , which is loaded at opening the project . in , more about proj@@ ections can be read .
this enables the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is available . the Debug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this , the de@@ bu@@ gger is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles you can upload high la@@ under@@ profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing an own construction supervision for every profile .
in the sub@@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , one can switch to event promotions and add these actions to modify or delete these promotions , if a previously specific event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
by default , S &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced by now .
to open a different project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes from leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . same happens when you load a new project .
project man@@ ure provides free access to files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; folders are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Fol@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are missing the entries and opening ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click context menu : &quot; &quot; &quot;
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the site of the most beautiful files . see .
enables removal of the current profile . if only a profile exists , the button is termin@@ ated to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in memory and for@@ table it . this possibility is useful when most common loading of files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password can be saved on the record .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high @-@ size profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto several servers . at editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your att@@ acking shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be easily read , but each with programming results it can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and toolbar . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar , can be stored , opened or deleted through the Settings toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul &apos;s own way of working .
as mentioned above are sket@@ chy in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . the best using the toolbar can be used . the adding of the toolbar will be treated at the bottom of the section of the toolbar .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar button ) , in which a new toolbar can be executed , changes or toolbar can be executed , what actions can be specified in the dialog , which actions can be displayed on this or other sub @-@ toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , you will also remove the entries to remove and receive action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up the toolbar settings and set settings according to settings .
templates are essentially related , code sni@@ ff , code cut@@ lets and files for short@@ cut . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ingly ; used in principle as a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or preview any system already existing in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you put on the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template , prior to usage exactly .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using link@@ ages ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates . additional information on the Templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . you usually make special rum@@ ors for the purpose and organizes the work in proper fashion to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Templates tree .
this type of templates is useful when not a new document is intended to be inserted in documents on a template but the same text range . you can find everything from a comment on a final note system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Templates tree .
as the name says , these templates will be organized for entire websites than templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template as a local template store ....
once that has happen , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project position ) the submission is not visible in the project @-@ tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select Text in your document and click File As template Save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged &amp; drag to the construction of a template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a sub@@ stitution folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and storing or inser@@ ting through the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files construction @-@ view on a folder right and secure site template , secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
proj@@ ections allow a very pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful operation . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP . you can create files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things to keep in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and files . each of these folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu Properties . the following dialog will appear :
a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ used as soon as the attributes of the attributes have been asp@@ iring .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the tri@@ but@@ aries in the template overview . if a root folder would be set in principle , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear to appear with something like text Tree . if nothing appears , it is probably in a root folder .
permits the refer@@ enced or later text for templates in this folder . these could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and enables copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers , a whole presentation already available with head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have a context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which is accessible via the Settings menu . the first mode replaces the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cursor , then you can edit and turn back when needed to source code editor , in which the changes introduced in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor will run and the cursor in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor will be activated , this mode is already active , the button moving out the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization gap between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta setup .... Acc@@ ording to select V@@ PL ; View you can select between synchron@@ izing according to one click or automatically select . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time period . basically , the recommendation is : a small amount for fast calcul@@ ator and a large pan for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , making tools documentation . this means the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . it serves the reduction of the suspension code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags , the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down , e.g. keywords in the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not yet supported .
it &apos;s possible to include an external CSS @-@ style system by pressing on the file open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is like in a text @-@ processing , possible by means of the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be typ@@ ed as usual . text can be re@@ activated by typ@@ ist or re@@ vocation .
the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar icons , as in the source code editor . it is noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , surround it with text , every other call@@ out anchor must be removed each day .
some toolbar as the tables assistant or the Listen wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists are used to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the period can be pursued .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile them , you need except &amp; KDE ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , i@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml which are available at a typical installation of &amp; KDE ; already exist .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ ename without p@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ance . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the most up@@ loaded period file names with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the working directory con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded for example a period file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
this command will be checked on a partial or complete agreement with a pre @-@ name named QNA@@ ME or a given mod@@ al name . &amp; eg ; template is in with any QNAP ME , which includes the string template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace of the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be expanded according to the rules , which is defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the X@@ SL source file . update to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desirable holder must be resolved for the related UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re@@ checked shortly after the launch of each cycle .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can browse through the arrow keys to / from the device memory of the previously mentioned commands .
several commands may require more than an argument . quotes are used to commit compound phrases as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; set .

there are lots of graphic tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors to make a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text at the same time . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a great deal of conflicts when performing together .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
if you would like to compare fast text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ isons window .
a function the much work was that was the same and assemb@@ ling of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way cooperation is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files when running :
&amp; G@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare the same and merge complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder connection :
&amp; G@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact difference and serve them with the possibilities of today @-@ wise color monitors . if you have to frequently check the code , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines are only shown in a certain number of white signs , one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle , if someone changes the objection . )
when a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself the type of animal work by writing only the fil@@ ename of the first file .
Semi@@ tic 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder
opening dialogue allows to manually enter file name , selection via the file browser ( file ... ) , or selecting a recently opened file from the list box . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be empty .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or assemb@@ ling of folders . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if cl@@ ashes have been crossed , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set a output file immediately . you can get this step later in the storage .
the setup -@@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the same / connection .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; we@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialogue you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and drop pulling : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains for example several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these features are , they would have to generate two appropriate files , them in &amp; we@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare .
note : right now you can draw nothing from &amp; we@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the pit@@ falls of text into a comparative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and storing of text into another program as out@@ cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text@@ box is the info line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line . then a little bit of the file will display the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to the letter A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preference may be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees at the color , which file distinguishes itself . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
links next to the text is the constitu@@ ent column . if differences are found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separ@@ ating the constitu@@ ent column of the text is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . when the line is activated , the line is shown to the broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has an info line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually , it contains in the automatic connection already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the storing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ inge to the closest soluble / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group belonging to the line is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also indicate the current group ) . this group is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes you don &apos;t have any more line left in the group by automatic editing ; then no row is displayed in the quest ; no row is displayed in the file . this text appears either in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may perhaps copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; tigh@@ tening conflic@@ ting ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you choose from the sources the options are ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the run @-@ runs and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys on the right , beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the apple window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between one @-@ one and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns , the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as previously described in the section ) and the edi@@ table image window has been explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image A@@ down ) or to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap ) as a conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts can be distinguished .
to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is automatically copy , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is automatically copied , because you could over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variations use a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ isk \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 reserves the line @-@ out of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved at the finish and restored at the next start@@ up . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are shown in recur@@ sive writing . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be shown . on these systems , the button preferences automatically marks an odd color .
when this option is activated , the appropriate number of spaces is inserted in the box of the tab@@ s button . otherwise , a sp@@ ulator sign is inserted .
when you press or return , the inser@@ tion of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line .
if this option is enabled , any selection will automatically copy into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then .
you can select which type @-@ end @-@ type you prefer for saving . the pres@@ et value is the common standard selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files are tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be ignored in source files . only during this first step , white signs are compar@@ es . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even when taking a white character , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon range &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save only a row @-@ pre@@ dict@@ ate &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , wagon range may be visible , however , like a white character . during operation , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensive after still smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic re@@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be moved .
dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters using the selected file is used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters occur in many files as a source . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comment .
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scanning folders and per@@ sec@@ uting a con@@ duction . look for details under documentation related to the directory comparison and assemb@@ ling .
when a file is stored and already an older version already exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if you already exist such a back@@ log file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further securing .
adapting to the language of the interface . changes this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop &amp; kiss and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper settings will be used for all entries .
over the selection of the enco@@ ding for the co@@ ding appears a brief reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters will be treated and interpreted . as the co@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different co@@ ding can be compared and combined .
if you have dealt a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not function with your co@@ de@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off in order to supp@@ ress types of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ant or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files are shown . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second super@@ visor column with the required information .
sometimes you would prefer to use the space available on the screen for a long time . bl@@ ends the less important windows ( this option is located in the window menu . )
ranks the compar@@ isons between one another or another to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts assemb@@ ling and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output files . ( when this function is used to restart the file , then the name of the last file used will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is passed first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences , which matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut a dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file , it is passed first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the line @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue .
the thought behind is to enable the user to gain more flexibility in setting up the Di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely .
use this command processing command to convert the entry into major letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * is recorded in this context all characters in a line . the \ \ &apos; s trans@@ forms the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use a few keywords automatically generated by typ@@ ed text strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ words sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ ) . the \ \ in the $ is needed , because $ a special sign would mean and end the line .
while you are experimenting with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you like these regular phrases even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is well known as an example for another pre @-@ processing accessory for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ine . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / sub@@ stitution / switch . however , per@@ l takes only some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the advancing &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and con@@ co@@ operations . further operations just change the data that can see the line @-@ off @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the file @-@ file processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders re@@ plac@@ sively and together .
... makes a proposal for each object to collapse ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the assemb@@ ling and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without them really perform ,
... select selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is very similar to the same and assemb@@ ling individual files very similar . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folder will be merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merging . to start merging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details will follow . )
during reading the folder , you will receive a little news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files listed until then were compared .
when the scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder of the scan performed during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a single click .
the folder structure is normally presented together , clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the icon or clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and fl@@ aps up all sub@@ directories with which you can catch all the folders and folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will start the same and it appears a compar@@ isons window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the co @-@ operation action can not be automatically selected . if the merger will run , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as seen in the picture above , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black .
in identical returns the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders will be considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . with folders , the age is im@@ material for its colour .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf re@@ vel@@ ier , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old when it is old .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merging can not be started .
... A and B not have the same type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merging can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories are synchron@@ ically active . then cho@@ oses and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : to merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the assemb@@ ling copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folder will be merged and select the option New File instead of con@@ duction ( uns@@ afe ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such mistakes are not removed , the merging of the folder cannot be started .
during the co @-@ operation , a file becomes a file after the other . you status column shows fer@@ vor , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , when something un@@ expect@@ edly performed . if the operation is completed , you should make a final review and veri@@ fying whether the status is fine all over .
when it is selected in the furniture dialog the file comparative method is selected , C@@ diffusion 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ com@@ ers , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or combined . )
you can either merge the straight @-@ selected record ( file or odds ) , or all the entries at one time . if you have selected all the inter@@ tw@@ ins actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have any target folder , then it will be used in a three @-@ folder running mode C as the target , while the two @-@ folder merging will be chosen as target and used in synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all the entries are to be displayed in the target folder but also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options caused by the particular entries . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to bring all the entries together , select directories start / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting data types still exist invalid , a message appears to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog window will appear with the options running , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting .
choose Sim@@ ulate when you just want to see what would happen without the real change . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then exec@@ utes certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge with a single file ) , then an assemb@@ ling window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again directory start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a proper dialogue will appear . then leads &amp; we@@ dge 3 ; his work with the next entry will continue .
if &amp; we@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and a detailed state information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to transfer the cause of the problem . if you select the merge again ( F@@ 7 button ) , lets you choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries were individually combined , these entries ( in the current session ) , and carries them together again together . even if the cl@@ ashes have been over@@ thrown or not saved again , these entries will be deemed to be done . only if you change the cl@@ ashes , these entries will be re @-@ combined .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ together with these options :
only files that match to the indicated pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . there can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . there can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a file is marked as hiding . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in the default .
with links to files : when the option is off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared , on which the links show . this is disabled in the default .
with links to Fol@@ der : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder checks and recur@@ sively check . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions lead and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched off in the default .
exec@@ utes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics column . ( the number of soluble , un@@ ten@@ ants , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower compared to a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower if they are applied to files that no text contain . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster , just change the change date and the file size . however , this speed display does not cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the chan@@ g@@ ation date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . for example , this can be useful when copying the change of change . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the sync mode when two files are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals for the merging of files are identical . also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences , instead of the merging the newer file is suggested as action . ( this will be considered uns@@ ure as it will not have changed the other file . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default .
when a file or a folder gets replaced or deleted by another file , the original version will be ren@@ amed with .@@ c@@ g extension , this will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of files . this option is switched on in the default .
normally , the Fol@@ der eyel@@ id view can be visible from the merging of individual files ; you can switch the window @-@ window with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the option directory &amp; text@@ window to switch main window in the window menu and switch between the two opinions between the two opinions .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu , you can also merge an appropriate menu entry . as soon as you save the result , the status will be put forward , and the file will not be re @-@ combined when you start the folder together .
this status goes lost , however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new read
KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diffusion 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line is compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ o@@ unding . or .. .@@ This is not possible with URLs not possible , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mask . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ ad@@ line &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it may not be distinguished if a link shows to a file or folder . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to modify per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , soft the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as differences spect@@ ator in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first the built @-@ in differences @-@ viewer . to start K@@ diffusion 3 , press the right mouse button on the Differ@@ ences viewer and then select In K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files does exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; we@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 ( now He@@ ist are compact ) there are already . additionally , the name K@@ diffusion 3 already indicates that it can carry together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs for very long and have learned a lot by being viewed in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who are gone to this path or go to this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not have the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration , configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( eg . diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs vary , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines keep next to each other , this ph@@ is , but this sli@@ is of the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is required , however , if the result is easily saved as a text file , and it &apos;s much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was up to date . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly is co@@ ded ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; published and the text does not fall out . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; G@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to give rise from differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and troubles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest modifications can be found at htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
around &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; install and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker uses , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ R@@ emo@@ ve ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replace the current market .
show differences : files that appear in all folders are not identical in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences appear . if the target folder these files are not already included in the target folder but if the target folder these files do not already exist , they are missing in a later program version probably . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default , this option is disabled . underground differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual des@@ ktops . it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the desktop areas to finish their size , to finish it or move it . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ ktops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked upon , when on an empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only clicked on an application inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu appears as well as the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if a application was clicked on .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if a application was clicked on .
if this cross marked field marks , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop areas .
if this field is crossed , in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ ktops are displayed .
tick@@ ing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual des@@ ktops will display . it is attached together with name , the names with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ Pay is provided , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to make their selection .
here the view of the program window selected . simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is determined : classic makes &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in an 2@@ x@@ n re@@ aster appear , as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other Window@@ s@@ anders ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ ktops in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series , which is very good for the display on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ atures in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content and can move and move outside of the control bar .
right click inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . right click inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent ex@@ changing from switch to ... leaves the dialog settings appear .
at the moment this can not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ propaganda , with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ .@@ If you do not have any des@@ ks for the file , you must log on as a user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ rid mode and give this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the pack@@ et base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE packages .

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you &amp; k@@ like ; start a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ like ; shows the enlarged image of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fier window .. the image that is displayed in the enlargement window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting is magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ like ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor such as an event@@ ual magni@@ fier . alternatively you can &amp; k@@ likes ; to make a selected screen range in the picture window ( selection window ) , or the environment of the mouse cursor on the screen : ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse pointer over . please note that &amp; k@@ like ; currently not able to detect the form of the mouse pointer . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to suit your needs . you can change it using the arrow and mas@@ onry and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cursor in the enlargement window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the content of the enlargement window and move it into the arrow keys .
if you press the &amp; Shift , button press or die &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . notice that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only move the lower right @-@ hand corner .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy a file into the clip@@ board ( to add it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click once the mouse @-@ cursor has a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who prepare pain in the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain@@ s . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may hurt pain , which are associated with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to get it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain thus helps with the mouse to be caused by clicking the mouse , it is against pain , which can be caused by the light due to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may vary for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse click once you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent version is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is running the push of mouse button . in this way , you can run the finish with pressed mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling with pressed mouse button . in this way , you can move the drag button with pressed mouse button . the smart push requires a little practice , but you get used fast to it .
this devast@@ ation period must suff@@ ice after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click leads .
is intelligent version turned on , the turning point is turned into ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it returns the mouse button again , if there is no box due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse @-@ displ@@ ac@@ ement . this function is enabled , creates a slow reference to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow converting to the left and back leads one double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt . this moves are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt files ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move and KDE ; to move the reaction times . click on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers .
is this setting checked , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; KDE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; KDE ; please use the respective documentation for rate to find out how to start a program automatically there .
sets all the settings back on the values that were set in opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be reset based on the last score .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular the intelligent box you should first switched off . if you then have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse button , you can later push the smart push .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it will be necessary to decrease the responses of &amp; KDE ; in case of sound lengths .
first , you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not constitute a link , does not imply any un@@ used reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such locations until you want to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ elt , you should puri@@ fy your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you must remove the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the finger@@ tips .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when it &apos;s just started to run the intelligent version , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by the slogan of the mouse .
this happens when you &apos;re &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can even execute a mouse click here . this is done by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want it . however , you can hide the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to give him a keyboard short@@ comings flowing out . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent version , but I do not manage to edit text .
the smart push is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it in the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board and to re @-@ insert it into the clip@@ board . however , it will likely prepare them once again . here are some advice on this :
use the intelligent box if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead as follows : perform at the one end of the text@@ field one mouse @-@ click and hold the move @-@ cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this becomes all times when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the intelligent version the exp@@ ulsion time begins . later you can use the smart t@@ anning available without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you need to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker , and they are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ rot@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor just per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and where the lin@@ t of the Mau@@ le pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to make it a certain time waiting for that a pulling process begins , before the mouse stops moving . in this way also the pulling and de@@ pot can be done with the mouse .

on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that will later be used for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings .
on the second page you select the default text @-@ book . from the text pass@@ books you can often choose text @-@ passages , without having to type in touch . the text messages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the chosen language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each words . additionally you can write the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are taken into the Wor@@ ker .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly visible and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white panel in the scre@@ enshot ) and a verse memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white figure in the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you k@@ mouth ; properly addressed , you can enter in the input field the Sets that you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the storage space . you can select these propositions which are to be talked about again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page vocabulary , as well as the page of K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the box map of the box language version you enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you place the text enco@@ ding with the text to the language generator .
&amp; Mon@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text manually . select the tick@@ ing box when the text is to be shared as standard input to the language generator .
if the inter@@ sect is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to language version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of how to find it in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as a first attempt to use as a language service as a language service , the further settings on this page will be used . the kt@@ end@@ on language service is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; KDE ; provides a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection of action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ agen@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ agen@@ book is triggered .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the selected text passage is arranged directly and additionally inserted in the storage space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box Connect the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ book , you can specify whether the text @-@ book @-@ book in the closing of the editing window should be automatically saved .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ book the book is saved . if you choose to make changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . dial in the date , will be copied &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ per@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ per@@ ation . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
with the buttons right on the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field , the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; will then read the &amp; KDE ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by eff@@ ecting of the re@@ occurrence . additionally you can add the word@@ list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to add only properly @-@ driven words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how these are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically adds into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ agen@@ et@@ books is divided in two . in the upper part , the text @-@ books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit an selected record . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the Aut@@ umn or the related short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ agen@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text messages or books add or remove selected text messages and books , either using the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or using a hing@@ ed menu .
the order of text messages or text messages can be changed by drag the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Old ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the outlet store .
the selected text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the outlet store .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the outlet store .
if this menu entry is tick@@ ed with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar button is arranged by default by the editing window directly below the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the refined left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is tick@@ ed , a narrow box in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appear if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , there will be a shifts for text pass@@ agen@@ book with entries . the body is arranged by default by the editing window directly under the toolbar . by mouse @-@ click on the refined left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the language version not correct or incomplete . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the map voice . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
Festival is a language version of the University Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch is currently supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the language version , it is assumed that Festival in / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to language version is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; ground level language generator . currently , he only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line to set up the language versions , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ets . language version is then possible with one of the three following command :
for the third example the option is to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ one@@ emen in a Wav@@ eter@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to cut the text in Ph@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to send H@@ adi@@ fax to the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be app@@ ended . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; ech@@ o quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / f fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all sections of the command must be written in a line . the option data as default input must be switched on .
the language version of the L@@ äm@@ on of &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; KDE ; applications is currently being further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
as the language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
around &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally store for the language generator ) , which depends on both your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak , can not speak text by calcul@@ ator . there is a list of already saved phrases which the user can always aband@@ on again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer includes . on the computer must be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&amp; kt@@ own ; - the voice @-@ issue system of &amp; KDE ; - is one of modules of existing service , allowing any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface to read .
&amp; kt@@ own ; is a part @-@ system in &amp; KDE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common fields of application for &amp; KDE ; -@@ programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS @-@ abilities . also , the users also offers interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; KDE ; applications embedded .
the language version is done via the program Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of language outputs in the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; - Help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you are able to use program Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher , you must install Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
at the first start of t@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r or as long as yet no spokes@@ person are set up , the cart@@ on card will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the cart@@ on card will be displayed in general . see below .
most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is distinguished in volume or speed . you should also have a speaker set up for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least one speaker setup before you &amp; kt@@ end ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speakers .
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple printer spo@@ si@@ ties for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ on@@ box speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r , the map card is displayed , then automatically when you start t@@ sm@@ sm@@ g@@ r and still no spokes@@ man is set up .
all the previously appointed speaker appear in this list . the fav@@ oured speaker appear above in the list . the top speakers will be used for voice output if an application is no spokes@@ person .
with a single click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
click with one mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a single mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ . system .
here , select a vote type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and Girls &quot; girl to choose from .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker icon on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already nearly use . go back to cart@@ ography card General and check if language versions activate ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable them . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ own ; click on the card card assignments to create and manage text messages . see below .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice recording system of &amp; KDE ; click on the box card , to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this connection field to activate the &amp; kt@@ end ; this starts to enable the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the card card accepts orders and you can read text messages and read them . see . remove the markings , the K@@ TT@@ SD , and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; KDE ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , as far as the field of voice output is crossed ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this cross is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r appears when you read automatically in the system range of the control bar , it disappears again , once the pre @-@ read is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start text messages , start off , stop and resume .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE ; clip@@ board to read or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click on or OK , then all modified settings are adopted on all pages .
the card card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD to start , click on the box card General and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if it &apos;s going to read , and select the text you want to read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ aders and other un@@ visible brands are also read also .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text shown here . check first if it &apos;s going to read , then select the text you want to read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then the voice output should begin .
this also works , if &amp; K@@ ate ; are embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ;
K@@ No@@ tify is the message system of &amp; KDE ; that you will be notified of you by you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE ; , you can set different types of messages ; for example , you can indicate that you will be notified in an IR@@ C channel , where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; KDE ; program K@@ No@@ tify , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu settings . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
filter for drawing software offer a good opportunity in bed ; it was a good example . it is a good example . you remove the tags and b from the news , the K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box since this can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filter is one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ . ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before he will be sent to Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speakers or to avoid certain short@@ comings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs from four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will be translated to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the requested orders are continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
News have the nearest priority . a message sub@@ section regular text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can enter with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who has just entered the room . &amp; KDE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text messages . each order you encounter from the map card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ ite is an example of an application that uses text messages . text contracts are intended for the output longer text that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are shipped in queue , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this issue will be held and ended .
first you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ posit@@ ors . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; KDE ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
text strings replace parts of a text by other text . the content can be delivered as words or as a regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ end ; is made with pre@@ defined image belts as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from one format to convert into another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; available in SS@@ ML .
with Spre@@ ader optional , you can send orders depending on the content of text or depending on the program , which has sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have submitted for example on the box card speaker a female voice , you can read text from KDE messages on it . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , after which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not apply , its rules shall not apply , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; al@@ erts on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all activated filter , which are set down on the page . the processing by the filter takes place in sequence in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed the line according to the bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters and you will see the following optional feature dialog below .
for setting up strings , you need to insert a list of words or a regular expressions as the comparison pattern . these patterns are not found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement parts . large and sp@@ elling is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . this name can you choose as desired , it must only be distinguished by the names of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used if the speaker is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ trl .
here is a value written here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID runs programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need to we@@ e . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 appears , you may only enter .
the purpose of the drawing purpose filter is only applied to the text when all conditions associated with an entry in the box specified filter if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all the texts .
in comparison between words the string composition measures regul@@ arity in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this hand@@ book you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; outlet &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former transl@@ ates XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to the well @-@ shaped XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . when x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the environmental variable PA@@ TH also reaches x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker cable filter , you can send texts to a certain speaker , who is attached on the box card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set that texts can be read from a female voice from a female voice . see below .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filters , there is an speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker @-@ properties that displays the text on &amp; kt@@ own ; sends out , and the properties of the speaker card appointed under the speaker card speaker . with the speaker cable filter you can over@@ write the chosen subject .
here is a value written here , the filter is applied if the text contains the print@@ able expression . is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phrases installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to help you enter .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of the desired accessory . if the text meets the conditions specified above , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the stage . click on the button right to display the dialog selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your inter@@ phone settings or delete all settings .
the speaker cable filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box database if apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , of &amp; KDE ; to give thanks to the programmers their applications T@@ TS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language version API from &amp; KDE ; . complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the KDE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the aforementioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ formation filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not pre @-@ read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so you don &apos;t have to do so if you don &apos;t have to use this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed and found via the environmental variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or vibr@@ atory characters appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences will be over@@ thrown or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option character enco@@ ding is set on the correct value for appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string carrier . see .

the voice syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you will find in the accompanying documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that own a separate license .
if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can put the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it in Fol@@ kt@@ ts@@ d . also , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ cks under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / KDE / .
contains a lot of languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the htt@@ p page : / / Trans@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Russian , Russian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza bio .
K@@ T@@ TS can also work with every language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the languages listed above can be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check out also on the Website of kt@@ own ; , according to information which are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adaptable module @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to wi@@ den &amp; kt@@ end ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; implementation filter is not necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
in order to compile &amp; kt@@ ate ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages c@@ utter and developer files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ es , or have downloaded all night previously mentioned tar@@ ball , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher works with your voice syn@@ thesizer . for this , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ cription SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which is used the program Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g@@ r is to be developed so further that the institution of Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher is made directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user can go back to the pro@@ posi@@ tional or administrative rate , repeat the output stop or break down .
when an application declares . if an application declares text , it may request the properties of the preferred speakers for output . so if you have established a spokes@@ person , the language of English and whose sex is female , this one is automatically selected to select the most suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ own ; a speaker cho@@ oses to see you in .
if you click on the map speaker for adding and click editing a speaker at the list or click Edit , the box card speaker is displayed for festival Interactive . as an example , the module &apos;s setup is displayed for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path is included in the PA@@ TH Festival , you only need to enter the festival festival .
select the text enco@@ ding for text that is handed over at the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; are well @-@ known , this setting will automatically be made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you provide volume , intercom speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you choose not to choose .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to load several seconds due to their size . if you mark this tick@@ ing , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first sentence will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster in the first sentence .
if this cross @-@ field cannot be selected , you do not yet have a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . see below .
if this cross marked field is marked , when starting t@@ ect@@ sm@@ sm@@ g@@ r is displayed on the program window . otherwise , following the start the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to read or control it otherwise .
here are all orders placed in queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just finished sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID ID on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select sat@@ a trip on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) .
with one click on OK , all changes to settings ( also on the other cards ) and t@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is reduced to the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Fre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .

on this map card you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will be translated to all other orders and keeps these orders placed . after the issue of the screen readers have been read , the ordered orders are taken again .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issu@@ ance of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message sub@@ ju@@ ly normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are &amp; eg ; just have a long text on a web page read , you can meet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nonetheless someone welcome the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ ader , adds &amp; kt@@ ate ; the audio edition to queue is long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map ticket only apply to normal text messages . for news , warnings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language version . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . also marks for the control of the pr@@ on@@ unci@@ ation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( Bri@@ tically male ) because this is the default voice that the festival uses in the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or pitch is set in the Festival configuration dialog not to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ S@@ Ds ) . S@@ B@@ Ds are beginning to read more quickly , not the whole text order . this allows you to also jump or stop the full text order . this allows you to also withdraw or stop the full text order , even if the language syn@@ thesizer do not support this directly .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the default of the real@@ ising filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , beginners will be de@@ void of it .
in the easiest way to learn the layout selection by extracts . please check the speaker card assignments , which speaker works , select some properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . of course , you must have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ly ; then start faster with the previous one , as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole word block , which can last very long
you can then pause text messages to the map or break down , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ing pattern is automatically set up when you kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r for the first time . it cannot be off , just change it . change anything in this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
text @-@ recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular character ( dec@@ imal code ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( tab are automatically removed from the text ) . notice that the standard pro@@ found@@ ational filter reserves the character .
S@@ BD et filters are never applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ News ( k@@ ap ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ posit@@ ors .
if you have removed from version the normal typ@@ ing belt filters , you can insert this again by loading the file in bed ; included file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the map ticket , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the default holder ( the top@@ most point on the map card speaker ) . in other words , there will be no inter@@ speaker properties .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not select or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ own ; this speaker cho@@ oses or kt@@ own ; the speaker comes from , the most commonly issued characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired speakers by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , enter nothing .
highlight this link if the property is supposed to have priority before other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , this property is always treated as a priority property . you will not want to specify this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application is sent text in another language than that in the work environment .
to use all properties in the field speaker , who is closest to the following , click the button kno@@ b standard speakers and then use the speakers that corresponds to the following .
in this case 0 is valid for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number ( without order number is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have been de@@ bug support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability .

on cardboard card audio there is a setup speed . to this this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen vote this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; and HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l @-@ file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML conversion , and set the intercom speed up .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , its source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust loud@@ speakers , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help to find in the tutorials that are delivered with Festival . do you want to read web pages , you must download the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . German votes are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice is still ahead of 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / / / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ cle@@ p ( 8 @-@ bit ) code as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . it is therefore first looking for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the codi@@ fication must be adjusted to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the codi@@ fication must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cycl@@ ist such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R example .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &amp; Control Center ; to enable the management of the network interface , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; Control Center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu at contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; # contro@@ l@@ center ; create the ranges of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module is displayed in the &amp; S@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module is displayed ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be implemented and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device has shown at all and allows the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the files , according to the key version :
the module network settings is loaded if the option is selected via network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . at the start of the module network settings , it is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list that is best meets the distribution and the releas@@ ers . by flag@@ ging the setting non @-@ re @-@ ask , the setting may be permanently taken . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , what settings can only be considered , the adjusting is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will be able to switch from clicking the button administration mode , at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . these can be divided into three riders :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interface , the following tasks can be performed :
you can set up the settings of the network interface by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of a button ... in the dialog device that you set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below and displays the dialog with ongoing options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system also sends the required TCP / IP information on each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , can be selected according to the system .
the manual is available without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field .
if this setting is checked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values reported in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device sound .
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching of a activated network unit takes place by selecting from the list and click interface to activate .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching of a activated network unit takes place by selecting from the list and click the interface to disable it ...
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net , where the gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer uses only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p is requested : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS will trigger this name into an IP @-@ address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer is added to the nam@@ ing solution part of the equ@@ ator nam@@ ing solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a presentation and up @-@ or to a down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons , or placed under the priority .
by clicking the button mouse button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution can be added a DNS server . it will add the new nam@@ eser@@ ver &apos;s dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add button . the entry then will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the Edit button . it will display the editing process .
the list named well known calcul@@ ator describes a name @-@ to @-@ IP address mode for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boat if there is no DNS server available . in small , enclosed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list includes some known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are available . these are still in the test @-@ conditioned version of IP must replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... The New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several Ali@@ as names , de button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name of a name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s name will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings @-@ made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , it must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distribution ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; using rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical surface such as machine package or the installation utility of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE is sufficient , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile it . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second part all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files discussed .
this area can not replace more knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is given into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks is operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 5 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found tremendous spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is going through in the near future . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the contact administrator that may use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily . in any case , the IP address can not be easily chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a special area reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore any use is made possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission line .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered in DSL connections , so that it is not surprising , if in case of active DSL connections , other content than fixed there is to be found .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs according to a schedule in the background . it is a graphical surface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
when starting &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; see a list already introduced tasks and related environments . if you use &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system and system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded .
in a de@@ activated task the program name and parameters are not shown and the description will be de@@ activated .
the editing variables here apply the otherwise existing environmental variables for all specified tasks except strength . with a de@@ activated variable appears as a description de@@ activated .
to create a new task , select first the task folder . then proceed in the menu to Edit New ... alternative to this , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and click in the context menu New ... select or C@@ trl ; N express .
enter the name of the program starting to start@@ up program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to look at the program first , press releases ....
choose the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; cr@@ on ; you can indicate the minutes in five @-@ fly steps .
if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) as well as a week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed on the 1st and 15th and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the chosen months , regardless of the week@@ day , no matter what date they fall .
as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active if the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
to cut a task , select first the task to be removed . then go to edit .
alternatively , you can click on the task right click on the task and select the button you press C@@ trl ; X .
to copy a task , select the first to copy the task first . then go to Edit .
alternatively , you can right click on the task and select copy , or you press C@@ trl ; C .
to insert a task first , one must first cut out or be copied into the clip@@ board . only then , inser@@ tion is available . select the tasks folder at all . then select the task folder . then go to Edit .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select inser@@ tion , or you press C@@ trl ; V .
to make changes to a task , select first one . then go to menu item Edit Change ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ose ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right click on the task and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start C@@ trl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be able to process the dialogue process in which you are described above , as described above . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to delete a task , select the task to extingu@@ ish . then proceed to menu item .
to activate or de@@ activate a task , select them and determine the condition with the menu item processing . in@@ active tasks are identified in their description with in@@ active .
alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and select activation . make sure you are looking for the activation that program &apos;s name , parameters and description are displayed correctly .
to order a task immediately , select it and start editing now .
to create a new ambient variable , select first to select the variable folder . then proceed to menu item in New ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click on the variable folder with the right mouse button and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or click C@@ trl ; N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most frequently used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the field for the variable names .
to send e @-@ mails from the requested program to another as the usual address
as with the creation of new variables , changes are made only when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
to cut a variable , select first the possible variable . then go to edit .
to copy an ambient variable , you first select the variable variable . then go to Edit .
alternatively , you can use the right mouse button on the variable and select copy , or you press C@@ trl ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first one has to cut or copied into the clip@@ board first . only then , the option insert is available at all . select the variable folder . then select the variable folder . then go to Edit .
to change a variable , select first the possible variable from . then go to Edit Change .... Altern@@ atively ) you can select with the right mouse button on the variable and edit ... or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It then appears to edit the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable .
to delete an environment variable , select first the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to enable an environment variable or disable it , select it and place the condition with the menu item processing fixed . if a de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activated .
alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select activation . make sure that the name and value of the variable is displayed correctly .
when all tasks and ambient variables have been entered or modified , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item File save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S press changes or supplements to tasks or variables only then active .
it appears the standard KDE ; -@@ printing dialog . if you choose to choose out , see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in dialog dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own extended permission .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xy cr@@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; soldier ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer it takes when you can secur@@ es ?
before a tape can be used , it must be part of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; soldier ; split the band back and read the pr@@ est@@ ess information of the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ . recognizes &amp; k@@ soldier ; the pre@@ ch@@ ann on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ on@@ er@@ aman is searching for the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be newly created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt drive is changed to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band .
before departure of the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; soldier ; by changing the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration of the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the volume can now be ej@@ ected without risk .
before a band of &amp; soldier ; can be used , it must be followed by &amp; soldier ; format@@ ted .
a band @-@ types have to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not require form@@ atting when you need to be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy drives usually apply a form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives , however , not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape continue . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting , the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the securing files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
select files in a local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select She@@ chem menu ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings will open for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for review . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the settings for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the procedure as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can install the restore , the files you want to be restored , it can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the associated entry . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives files and select re @-@ establish in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again review your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue will be rev@@ itali@@ zed . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file according to the belt content . this process delete all the existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two kinds of tape :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of permanent files will be automatically updated according to the selected working directory .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same fil@@ esystem , as the folder . folder that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files will be backed up since then .
the name of the file that will be used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshots of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of kno@@ bs files ; and lt ; and lt ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings at the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be set :
the full path to the device file for the belt work ( usually / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will load load to the drive . at some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
is the option switched on , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ soldier ; to lock the accus@@ ation during the band@@ work . possibly this attitude does not work at all band@@ work drives .
if the option is switched on , in solving the integration of a soldier ; automatically cast the tape . use this option not at flo@@ ppy stream .
if the option is switched on , temp@@ ting &amp; k@@ dier ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ving block@@ size for the band@@ aging work . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you &apos;ll have to notify the block size for your tape drives .
when a soldier ; a band is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is valid : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system is format@@ ted in which the belt has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been format@@ ted since the time in which the belt has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access the quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your machine is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced functions with the help to fil@@ tered the protocol files of certain programs and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features , including :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Samba
many other features are also included and are explained in subsequent chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file can easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially started to open the main protocol @-@ file system - the system Protocol - it will not appear , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system rout@@ ing . the protocol files are usually not included in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or according to text chains . in the default setting , the selection field contains next to the filter the entry . then , a protocol @-@ line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can of course select another entry at this point . select the column process for example in the log file system . select the name of a process in the log file system , and proceed in the filtering bar the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; c@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of stage notice . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched with dialog dialog .
if you want to display only specific process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or on cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful when you want to study the output of a particular instruction , such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option On new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new upcoming record lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. you will find more information about the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; KDE ; system V in@@ it editor , rather known ( and also named after ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V in@@ it is rapidly developing to standard for the control of the program start at the high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( including I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is located below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V in@@ it , without a re@@ install and re@@ form@@ atting . therefore , you need to ensure that the old ru@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it is also distinguished from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start at the high speed of the system or change to a different run @-@ level . system services include such things such as networking , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down on the one hand unter / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most systems have this file , even though there is not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial ports / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different places within the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial area :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit inter@@ viewed , then you come repaired by restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder are not proper files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start these scripts actually from hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way of making machine for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server runtime , which leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run it . furthermore , I could still have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the dispos@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level in order to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if the entry is done by its original sp@@ line ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they draw out an entry from the area of the dispos@@ able system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them into a new window , you will need to select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu and paste into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting number of the surrounding entries before you can try again , add the system service .
note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work@@ areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous version .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run @-@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the entry button to open the Properties dialog . use the mouse button to switch between different fields . enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or push Es@@ c to cast the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings will be extracted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . changes to preferences are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to launch in the individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution run under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ ver ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way the system services can be started in these distribution , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary furniture programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are needed from the respective system service ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without notice , if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can be even different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this hand@@ book can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
once you have made modifications , you need to store them . either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry into the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cases cards , the user interface and the user list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group features .
some cart@@ on@@ cards are only represented when you have advanced system settings . only if you have a limited system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ on card will be created where you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if you install individual settings , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card card password is displayed , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card appears only , if for at least one built @-@ in file system restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates and initi@@ alizes ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for each user parameter changes , the space restriction is limited in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using a limited range of file system using a space restriction .
the card card groups informs about the group &apos;s belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field pri@@ mate group . furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the big field .
the dialog Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , add adding from the menu user or group or click the fitting button on the toolbar button . the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group is similar .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change OS , remove , change , change , change , change , change , change , change .
