<seg id="12">To view the DOM Baumanure in & Konqueror; select the extras DOM show... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root of the document, example: documentates, all other nodes are subelements of this root knotting.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text messages to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The speciality of & FSView; contains in it, submerged folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is proportional to its size. this size must own the property that the sum of the size of the lower object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView; reflects the size of a folder or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. therefore, large files, even then can be recognized easily if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands you are looked at.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the tread depiction of a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easy navigation, the right-ecke will possess reasonable shades and label settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on view mode, can be either depth for the slight detection of the reprovocation or picture of another file-independent how name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature you can specify whether it is available at all, only if enough space to display is available or whether the surface of subordered rectangle may occur (although, however, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With display algorithms for Treemaps, the area should be adhered to proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treignin & FSView; this goal is not always respected. it will be drawn frame to show the scraper of the entries and this framework requires space, which is then lost in subordinate entries if the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries will be left to the implementation. here, it is so fragile and to supply space lusts by means always advantageous to the areas that are as square. the best methods on this are lines, columns or recursive second-division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal image for an entry about the menu entry view. instead, a frame pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher-level entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; originally developed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets, which was developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="55">A easy-to-use camera station will be made available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & #; of course each medium and every card reader, which is supported by your operating system will work with & #.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools. you can use them to review and correct your photos, to evaluate and correct. editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & # comes; easy to use, there is dutzing professional skills available. it works completely in the 16-bit color foam and all the available modules support the raw convergence via libraw, DNG export and ICC.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with a lot more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens over which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE; programs is also as planned; an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of the end users. therefore, they should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& Q: attempts to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you book yourself in the program, your web browser opens a page in the fault corrected system. all information you need is already registered here. follow only the instructions to submit your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& Wrong, is a project that is supported by a community. that means that the user and developer will help one another. if you're a regular user of & digitites, then we would like to answer you questions about other users of & #; in this mailing list, however, you should be able to answer any questions about that language, you should be powerful to this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also check the digitization of this homepage to get news about shared versions and other information about & digitites.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get off & digire; to participate is the registration in the developers mailing list. guidance to report in the developers mailing list of & digitiate;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & checking out; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database. you can simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the folder name folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is stored. this path remains the same for any image folder.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add soas many folders as you want to add. & Drop off; will use it in addition as a Albenlibrary. Setting Settings.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can indicate the top folder, which contains images, as a base folder. & digitifies every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search of the folder you will receive a progress report like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Wrong, searches with recursively the librarian in its entire depth. you cannot submit any subfolders, unless it iste in a hidden folder. this can insert you orbs & digitid; complete a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder, you will notice that the albums in my list will have no photos as symbols. you can change those by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder symbol. further details can be found in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the basic folder, you can set up & digitised; your digital camera set up. afterwards you should learn how to use my albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: in case you use the raw mode of your camera, it can also handle it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of resource support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Role-Decodersettings and Role workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">A easy-to-use camera station will be made available to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & #; of course each medium and every card reader, which is supported by your operating system will work with & #.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) to data transmission. the camera will appear as disk drives. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use under circumstances to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& Introduction; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera recording. gPhoto2 is also supported by picture transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association and allows transfer of images of digital cameras to calculators and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos in general are large files and transfers via serial port are slow, this compound is now obsolete. & digitization; supports these cameras and executes the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with ibexif support so that EXIF data is not required by some libgphoto2 cameregrets that could not be seen in libgphoto2. if the EXIF support could not be seen in libgphoto2, you might be thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do & digire; is how easy it can extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPO modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitised;, KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all video programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it's much easier to add & #; by writing a little module to add a function as the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">In order to simplify the window, you can either afford the page with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">The drag and drop images work anywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the tree, on the horizontal separating line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture can not be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to raise the spread out: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, black, toe, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar. so, the filters on the filename will be displayed only if this ind symbolises the toolbar as well. what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlister quot; provides an organized view on your photo shoots. these albums can be recorded according to folders in which they are stored on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or by date, where the album was first created, sorted out. the date can be altered in the characteristics of the album.</seg>

<seg id="90">The album Date: will be used if you sort out your albums after date with view albums.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, average, new tester: these put the date on the one of the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. to this, first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & Play first, the first image will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlister quot; chosen to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes, the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select a different photo as an album symbol, you must click on the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As a Albumschau branch; select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& Drop off; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left below in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Management assumes in, categorized, categorised, seeks, transformed, confected, and exports content that habby a monebears or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data. metadata are provided in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or manage other data, which are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you want to find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not just use it checking out;. the approach to save Metadata in a database as well as in image files, you can easily browse and secure a secure filing on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you need anything in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether other access to your photos are to store or on a network drive & etc. please note that you will have to change to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday images can quickly be found via your location. if you organize sufficient photos, then you will make subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, working procedures, constant transfer of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files, and you will then not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files are fit together? the separation of file types makes stacking simple. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that the Metadata option save in the Settings page of the Metadata in & #; this is certain that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget that, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point menu on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change something? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, of course these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now begin the real work as you should now assign any photo keywords, label and valuation. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then. they start making sense as you can concentrate on the best photos while you're working on.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now move with keywords, keyboards, as you frequently called by other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then it will always turn the tree for you to insert the pictures in the correct place. the modifications of hierarchy inside the building is no problem and can simply be done by moving from a subtree to another. the changed keywords will be followed by & digitised; updated while the subtrees were pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata cut itself. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth out of many sections. filename and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section relates to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! one begins to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you may perhaps even hear the silence. so the lettering has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other viewing your photos, the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help Him over the motive that you moved on what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if an image is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a lettering for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">By checking out, you can save as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures. KDE, these captions are exported to your wishes in the caption and / or the title of the Web gallery. you will have to tell the story for opening a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the days before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a tedious planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train departs the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of Geolokalisation are already countless and will continue in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily be able to open your trips virtually through images with geographic information. you can then also export the photos at the recording site. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and refers to the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information is stored in the furnishings site of & digitization; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for actors and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, such as the name of a company or organisation, it should not be changed any longer. this field does not support Kommas or semicolon as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for contraction): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment to the author field, this must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editors (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily have the author. if the photographer is working here for a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a campoto, here the picture / agency the image is shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the solution to this problem. for individuals, this is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermarks is unique per image. & #, in the near future, such a module can be made available for forklifts.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: compression, blackout, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the memory media, restoration, redundancy, desasteration, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photographs or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data-creation company of the world, has some interesting statistics which has loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must not be treated longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives, which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your yield area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you store good disks and good ascents and make them in the correct way store. the best DVD buoyancy securities are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. therefore, it turns the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very prone to errors, even if you have just written it. therefore, use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection, they are needed for chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a more favorable program called IsoBuster which seem to do wonders for CDs and DVDs. it also runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications, which damaged the damaged data from damaged floppy disks, hard disks, flashes, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six smal the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good appreciation of high-quality media in a not propriated format. also read the media with a description, date & author marks and then storing in a clean, dark dry and above animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be updated to this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disketmasts retain your statistics for itself. their manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives: dismissing the disk</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discs hold at the longest when you are operated in the temperamurrange of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperamers the fault rate dramatically increases the most common error messages, SMART can not determine this error. some of SMART fixed mistakes will notice the immediate imminence. these are especially readers and deposits. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also loss data loss due to an output before you secured the files, but these losses usually leave without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices power clashes do not make a lot of account, the anomalies with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can take severe damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause heavy keyboards, complete data loss, hardware boards and other defects. protect yourself from the Unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power sharpen is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy-slots and feed the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every plug-bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because a overvoltage of each cable has to be used to your computer, you should be sure that even all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and also contain the protection for modem. this makes you ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system will protect against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete loss. even an incident of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overrides these devices can automatically place cordless energy if an electric loss occurs. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and restart the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifespan of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security with electricity disorders associated with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected accordingly. to conclude, you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to hard drives, however, very expensive - 40 GB fees & cob; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & Dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable for a local loss of data loss. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-Community 23hq.com make online memory services available on photos. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional option provides you more available, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for $25 a year, you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data Backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with major companies is included in the offer of a backup and a partial memory. this makes it safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and bbutfs put at least the data integrability between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred, not even if it was in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you would not be destroyed by any day. nobody seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferencing within the data streams. with normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors on lower level and can be highly scalable. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its own free file system. this is still in the Alpha Status. it uses the same protective mechanisms the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss at the notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. when notebooks, the proportion of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them. it leads to a lower damage, than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been no more sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, itinerary, JFS and XFS, to call the broadened filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main valuables for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings away from fundamental physical limitations.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compactcameras and end result, the optimum solution for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">One 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by any loss of data. so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything else just like the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of records or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroyed a lot. forget the aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterprevention always means a not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential assurance: a backup of the files modified since the last complete backup. produces a complete snapshot of the two time points: the complete assurance and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been altered since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time and restore such backup. this backup comes with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only secluded and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a Wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP session or other types of file transfer scripts, copies only the difference of files that have really been changed. this happens decompressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure makes you enough time to detect losses and restore it. at the same time you come for backup however with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of for at least one month and a snapshot of each month. every additional dilution should be done manually after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, OSes, virtualization, viewing devices,..., Use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future because of your nature is unpredictable, you have to look at caution and evaluate everything today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage, storage technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's take the scalability that you have entered into the scalability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record has been detected by the system, but you do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& D / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & Dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & b; size of the plate in MBO; # 16, 32 and travel fs & D; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modify the size of travel if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read more, then you can create them yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that goes slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was used as an open source standard developed by GIF. however, it can be more pleasurable, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can only have many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you for storing your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF is stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossy compressor salt (deflates), but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a licence-free and open-image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. it is now available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why to replace the XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. file information is saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording, mostly in the format, to archived. XMP fits into being separately from the image file and as indicated above, the raw-format is painted. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of applications and business models. among the activities of DCMI is working on a architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, standard links and informative efforts to reach a far-depth acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the dealer or the scanner. as long as pictures are on the camera to use it, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert AVI files to DNG and save it in your raw archives. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & # then you should add the metadata again. these were recorded under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them into WebGalleries, paste into MPEG, use in contact leaves, print you & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & #. in the section of adding a photo to an album, you will find a description how you can add photos, which you can already have on your hard disk. but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised; connect it to the machine, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it. you can find a further description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ferous indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information about each entry. with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally from the camera. a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer-remark, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of & digitization; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their host, is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all. this loads photographs from her camera to a single album in & Play;. when downloading the photos are deleted securely in an album, before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of & KDE; as soon as you choose the photos, use the button download and then download the selected. the button selected is out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported it is an option New download. these pictures have not been downloaded by & digitised; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the showcase. if you choose this option, of course, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons All download or download it, appears a dialog with which you can select the target album, displayed in the photo. details about folder sorting can be displayed in the section My records. then select the target album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, click OK, and & #, the photos from the camera will load into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by delete the button Delete. if you just want to delete some, then you must select them first and use Delete Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note: please note that there is no possibility of photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check whether the photos are successful into a & checking out; if you want to delete it completely from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should get this about the camera screen, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly expressive name. the filenames are usually retired, after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can be useful to load photos from different scenes in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for date-based underscores. if you use this last option automatically a folder is created each day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all loaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use for example in the editing field the prefix photo -% -% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date and time to add. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strate time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you will have the option when downloading the file names in small letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & checking out; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that provides the camera in the preview. your settings to rename is saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& checking out; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to run a time of recording. not all cameras provide this information. in the page sidebar, you can read further details, about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic turn off, use the button blackout and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera will provide information about the date on which the photo has been made, can compile & digitization; this sub-collection are based on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras will provide this information. in the page sidebar, you can read which information your camera might be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case saves & checking out; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. just use the button 's-based submites at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer on their camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog and KDE; appears in which you can select the files you want to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, asks & Q: you, where the pictures should be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select here the desired folder and click OK to load the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this represents a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers could it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later the photo was taken, you can click with a click on a browser which indicates the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & #; users want to locate the location of the photos, or just document it, it's good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data be assisted in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as the direction, Sattelites and cartography support. the question is actually more like the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, using a reprocessing of GPS data and image files to geographic assignment (manual) and finally about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated. but there are a few that work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: Coyremote Eye IQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save this data in the gpx format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use these script using the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the "" "" unfolded coordinates that are created for example by maps.google. "" "</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street species. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected to download from the camera database. also with a database synchronization, this data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for a fibre title: this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer. this may be designations such as employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editors is a synonym for providers: use this field to enter the photo. this should not be the author, if this is working here for a Message agency like e.g. Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a campfire, then the group or agency should be made available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this makes it possible that the metadata are permanent in the picture and not only in the database by & digitised; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into & digitization; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images can be saved as built-in pictures (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos with the pictures included in the pictures. caution: with pictures that are already included, these are overwritten by the photos of & #.</seg>

<seg id="292">You can revert the default settings by pressing the button Updating right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digitization; can then open on this page onto the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. however, the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should use only on fast calculators. if you have one, then you can get better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing shows a black background behind the photos displayed. if you prefer a different color, you can choose them here. you can switch the toolbar button when you use image editing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed parts of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing this picture Mode can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in dyes. please read this article in Wikipedia for the further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG-compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is using a lucent free algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value on a high compression. here means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress, you can switch the deflates -comppressionsalms for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the deflate algorithm is running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss of JPEG-2000 files you can easily store out. even if you have to select the lulute setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata still not supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digire, the image processing was just a picks for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard lame is that all green pixels are identical. if the straight-hand green pixels of the CCD-Sensors in the output lines. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option marks the picture a little soft, eliminated but the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the whitewater is used with the camera. otherwise, if set, the Automatic paint balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white comparison is not set. standard is it a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card in the sunlight, is based.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps more details in the highlights. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it is the nicklichter, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the incapacity of your camera to catch the sharpened. in addition, you can use the adjusting control through white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the chieties.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick satious like green and red. and dCraw therefore attempt to reconstruct the missing green and red-shares from the still not saturated blue resolution. of course, this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you choose to construct the option, you get the option to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can / therefore be customized for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the grain-value according to your taste. you probably have to set it a bit higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digitised surface. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed more conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process, to generate a complete picture from the partial images, which has many cameras and that provides a matrix colorless pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& checking out; and Djerw make you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by DCraw. however, it produces colour lines at the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue-correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color error correction, since you are carried out during the rough.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digily; information about how to translate the color information from a color room in the other so the colors are as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Questions, if an image is opened in the image processing, the colour administration module with raw files will start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Slets you find the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & # then this folder will then examine during the starting point.</seg>
<seg id="315">Set of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-screen view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures colored does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. currently, there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dCraw Materials is not required for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the colorative mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be given from a device. this is very useful before you print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of leaving the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them for what. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is obviously inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon indle expands the style to the destination: F for precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image galleries and image processing tasks. by delivering this interface can and digitised; many modules support that were written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPO modules, you will see a list of the available modules. select the one you want to use and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find a few in the context menu of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks that can be performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitised; therefore they are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you can find in the section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A statline at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filummer, enlarging factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before saving the file or save the button save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer save the original photo once you have saved the photo.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it save with file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or button the button "button restore the image editing to the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have been performed at the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by installing manipulated or restored by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should be able to make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to turn off and Ctrl; -Umbralt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB on the backtracking or re-button in the toolbar button, you will receive a context menu. if you choose one of the menu entries, all actions are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar. if you have made changes in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to store them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can put in the photo in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally, you can change this in setting dialog by & digitize; you can view it in the Settings dialog. see this section to set up the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print images in the menu and get the standard & KDE; printdialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. all picture-pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album exports printing coach. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The default window has a side bar on the right edge, provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation splinle, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five horsemen is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple-click on the same rider can appear the sidebar or disappear back into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the modality view you can insert captions with unlimited size or insert. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are permitted. the label will be copied in the EXIFT and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut to 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After downloading it, you can either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the label will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the using button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Assessment section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting. it can either be applied to one single mouse-click on the 5 stars on the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written into the IPTC field urgency. encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords show a search box to the filters of the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the keyword before in this & checking out; session designated.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword. you can limit the number of ways in searching for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is further relief in entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed various keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the corresponding crossings in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view, select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you wish to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and Sukecules. if additionally some or more keyword filter is used from the right hand, only the intersections of the two are displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop some pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can easily drag it from the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialog displays whether you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window shows the images on a calender date. the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords, which was reduced by the amount to three pictures. they were taken with Strg + a, and then a keyword was dragged from the right keyword-tree to the selection and placed there. a dialog asked if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place every start of the program. it can also be switched among settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be a or be, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry which is sought after in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example you can choose a wide search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to group the crossbox at the end of the rule and then use the button group. the options look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfully-managed workflow, using the colors available from your camera or scanner, you can reach that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner, and the colors you print or publish on the web that you want from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the issue comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons and press needs to provide for the results he wants. unfortunately, this tutorial makes it possible to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you obtain the result you want.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image operates all the six below listed below, then you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color foam. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other pictures are via e-mail or the Web where the RGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and makes life for everybody so simple, then why should one use another color room and therefore have to worry about color wounded?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hugely-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color foam, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you wish to compare the 2-dimensional Representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, then visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click information and then information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I keren my Monitor when I decided to work only in the sGB color room?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color or not, you need to callibrate your monitor since sRGB itself that your; onitor is placed on sRGB. so if you're working as in the color line of sRGB, you need to either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a suitable monitoring profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, intentional, automatic and contrast from the menu corrigible automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. they will be experimenting with these effects to see which best in your photo works.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the luminance values over the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its shades. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusters the luminosity of the colours of the selected image, so that the Histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, it also produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either wonders in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scaling: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue-canal. you select the dark and bright boundary and adjust the red, green and blue-channels on the entire Histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest range and a revival of all values in between. this is only visible when washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off from & digitize; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-off correction is somewhat limited as there is a color foam with 8-bit per colour. if you are so too far from the original image, can perform areas with overexposure, which is working in the 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salmon, protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it using the menu entry of white glues to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side are both the original image and the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original whitewater settings again, then you can click the original window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target snaps has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a Histogram is shown that dynamically changed once you have a parameter change. this hisogram is very helpful as, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels are very small Luminescent values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminumance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadows of alignment can also improve the shadows of your photos or also be plainly.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above checks around to play, you should use the paint temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the white water temperature. this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the whiteboard line with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure index increases the colors when more than one colour canal is overexposed to the size. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as loading and store exactly this. each setting of the white is set you can save in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button default settings all filter values back to their standard values and the neutral neutrality. notice that the neutral settings will be shown a different photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will change.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the coding beads per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality photos. this coding is also necessary for high quality photos. this coding is also needed more record time, calculating time and stands onlyre for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw materials. paint tone mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color films may take you to the chapter of Color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors and correctly. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colors channels simultaneously and allow you to use your settings at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same bug and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">One very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for generating that you can find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The plate leased; tool Farbeffekte presents you four color effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantonal filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar isation, even Sabatians is called, an effect of the developed pressure. the colored, darker areas sheltered from the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lights. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity shows the image of what chemically possible is. a further increase is ultimately a negative picture that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effects. the original image is (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation thus making it a stronger contrast-effect that makes the colors brilliant and gloss. try it easily, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for his smooth image structure. Velebas strongly saturated color, but also some photographs, especially those who are hardly harness, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter is simulated neonlight on the contrast-canes. the parameter levels controlled the brightness of the result and the slate repetitions the strength of the neonlight. with large images the filter can reduce the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colorfully and the luminosity of your photo with the tools in the menu on colors. all your adjusting entries can be viewed at the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo at bad light conditions, you can get the reversed problem: one too big satiety. even in this case, the tool for brightness / satiety is a good choice to enhance the saturation. if you perform the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool engraving and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma is the tool Tonvaluation to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need for the purpose of explained purposes only the area of shale. concrete the three sliders below the Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the intensity values, a Histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under graphs are three sliders included in the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to learn is to postpone the regulator and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the Preview will be dynamic, updated with the settings of the picture, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selective box can be adjusted, whether the Histogram is shown with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear Histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic presentation is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top priority for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpallets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the pockets of the shadow, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output files: extract the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two buttons that can be used to evaluate the output devices as well as with the inputs. for example, the compression of the outlet can be used for example to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the values indicated in the filesystem can be saved and recharged later. this is the game level format used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three paint cores, the input data will automatically adjust to all shadows, resources and Sundays. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the Histograms for red, green, blue and the Luminanzcanals.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Transducting Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the output files are unchanged. the original picture is marked (1) and the corrected image with (2) marked.</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows the half of the original and the target image. the Preview will be dynamically updated according to your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier Channel: this selection box allows the channel to indicate which it is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmetic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you postcards for example a courier to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with dark-forks, corresponding and the corresponding picture strives are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and then move it down and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each bend that you created can be saved in filesystem and later be loaded on. file format is the Gimp _ venformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pips, the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sunny sounds. enable the color pette that you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator that you only get the effect shown in the Preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo which has been corrected in Luminanzcanal. shadow and sunny notes was set with the dypette and applied to the curves (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of & checking out; image processing is a tool to improve the colorations or to change the shade of shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selector, you can choose the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first reference to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the Histogram to indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to enable these channels. if you need Luminance, the monitor mixer then adjust the tool to create magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green canal for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrom, the reduction of a colour leads to an invisible robbery that comes from the bull's color and its smoke pattern is different in each channel differently. if that is the case you can improve your monochrom conversion, in which you can reduce the bull first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and store buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load it. used file format is the Gimp / Mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Transducting Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue Canal has been reactivated. the Luminumance option is activated. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / White is a working step, since color images can easily be converted to your computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford United 4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good in all the scenario pictures and fits especially well to portraits of the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filmed: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange flower filter. this improves landscape, maritime scenes and air-photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatical effects and can simulate lunar effects to the time of time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotor filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure to a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural hutoned correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and middle tones while it adds a bit coldness in the shadows of a pressure and re-development in a sepsis. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digitization; tool texture enables you to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the styles of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry image texture, use image editing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the semblance of depth and three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">In line checking out; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is no easy task. one way to keep his attention is to view the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streak eye. under picture frames, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you put the desired Rachel type for your picture. detail the picture with a colored line, Niepce envelops it with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black and white images), abbreviated it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a buttoned effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with designs.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image with the frame arranged is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially when you've used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in an image of any place. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just type the text and place it with the mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color foam and the character set with its characteristics as you need it. you'll just select a frame around the text and / or a half-touch background. already, the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you chose to have chosen for your text can press, until you press the button "OK," the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the checking of bed; tool wablone can apply you a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should want to add with maximum compressing (9) to resize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the file size of the template, simply send an e-mail in English to die & digire; mailing list digire-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">When you use this tool for first time, you need to put your zip-folder with the button base folder in dialogue. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template has been set out a construction-view that reflects the folder structure of the Schablonorordner. selecting a folder updating the thumbnails of the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview will find three buttons, which you can change the enlarging factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is the default image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob divider the below image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must classify the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below to the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then adjusted automatically by default size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization came; provides three different tools for tightening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for raising. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Improper mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's doing a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really enhances the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution must be combined into a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more volatification as normal cameras for private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often used internal sharpening. images in the format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during the process.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner is turning a field filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable it, you get the control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpen a photo with the edge-level signal. you can tightest with the menu entry under basket.</seg>
<seg id="487">However you should deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the edge increases the sharpness of edges, but also intensifying the smoking. in general, the usable technique for sharpening a picture the tool redirecting. under refocus you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for raising.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is to be crisp. the solution to record the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry to corrigible and experiment with it. the showcase on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help to edit the image. the display window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values generate frequent results and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you create the blurred mask, noise and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges are produced.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a cante are affected by the filters. high-res images allow larger radii. they should therefore take pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the wipes picture to be added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split out of the maximum RGB value and the applicable differential amount. it can thus define a minimum difference thus for a sewn of the filter. in this way areas are avoided with a soft switch between the killing from sharpenes and therefore flaw in faces, skies and aquatic surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitize; tool redirecting a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries one image to & quot; in which there is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. you can start making use of a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. you can start it from the menu by calling colors reverting in the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung operates a lot better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads far from the source pixel, which depends far from the original size. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular capacitor: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the standard value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should become very blurred, but then on Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter allows you to reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will consume the picture even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. in most cases, use this parameter to avoid excessive blunt filter. in most cases, you should use this value to zero in order to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may need to also increase the correlation and / oderroughter filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular field or the gauß'schen field. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving als and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any amount focused parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimmer, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not visible immediately, but subsequently leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compressing images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results as sharpens. this could be caused by this, the blurred masking uses a larger neighborhood as sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically have to become blurred masking ever artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of unsharpness. for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. convenient is the result of the FIR Wiener filter is often better in editing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison of the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods to the edge correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glets is the blurredness of the area of the blacked blacked to generate a more natural pellet.</seg>
<seg id="514">The dytinte enables a customized color for the groove. in case you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image infallible is one of the most sophisticated tool to remove not the artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inforalgorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preference are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings on a tuning, you can use the tablettering and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail: [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a moderate smoothing about the image. a value of 0.9 should get details that no depth is necessary. please note that the details should always be subordinated to the direction of direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Riding-dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or the CCD smoke will generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best found at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore put this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher that value is set, the more being smoked, because it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Retries: returns on how often the algorithm is going through. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle measurably since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should also be small. be sure that small angles can be a long running time. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stride-wide [0,1, 10]: integrated stride range in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. he doubles but the running time. therefore we recommend him to let him go.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as loading and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file saved and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load to itself. you can then cancel the calculation at any time with the button break.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied to a photo that is being taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black-fact caused by a bad documentary during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & checking comes; smooreduction is a very powerful tool for reducing tolling. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters available to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. by dust or hair on the lens, to remove. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or moid; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about Sensor cameras from digital cameras, then you can read them in English on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grande noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, only the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that is required for the filters per pixel and can fasten the picture above the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus made smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controlled the edge field. this value sets the pixel rate to determine the filter changes. if it is increased, the adaptive filters are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters can no longer receive and smoke or lubricate comes back on.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the whole noise or smokers can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a wax or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the picture. we recommend you to either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the crediting process which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controlled the color-tolerance of the picture. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the crediting process which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark-colored areas, which typically more solidified, however, it also consumes the slatted areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjittering. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter reaction to variations of lightness is reacted. if it is increased to appear, the edges can occur and phasenjitter at the edges can occur and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the smoking reduction you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2) marked. the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is a snack for your purpose. the solution to paint the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for soft sign with the menu entry to corrigible and experiment with the smoothing. the showcase on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digire; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to emerge Gauß'sches Rauschen, Filmgranularity, scratches, compression clothing and local errors that occurs in digital, original or retroactively digitised images, and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text-composition. the text-composition is performed with another tool, the image editor, performed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannda and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. than a lucent compressing compresssalms it generates some compression & quot; artetequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting aims to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo recovery is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with a uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film-granularity on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo recovery. this time textures was reduced to an old color photo, used with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by the scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The checking out; tool hotbed allows it to remove pictures of photographs showing with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression to have a built-in supred for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel" "" "and" "" "bright pixel" "" "; on a photo with a dark-picture-traction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">When you have an old digital camera it is important to pick you up the dark picture right next to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark picture to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark's image will find the bad pixels. notice that the wizard shows the last dark picture and that automatically loads it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image field and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken out in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area around the defective pixel and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: it becomes an average of the neighbor to be determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block, are drawn up to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-called) or a group of linear curves (1-called) or a group of linear curves (1-called). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-called) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubically: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of kublic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotness correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing. the original picture was enlarged at 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The checking out; Vignettifying correction is a tool for correcting the Vigneting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Vastly objective, especially those in the medium and large photo-format, can often illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting whites; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by using the light that the sensor can be achieved there. Teleobjective sometimes also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. vastly objective you should also use Center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharply effects may arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of current filtration and colour levels of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a blanket which is made without this filter. the tool of Vignettifying correction is applied to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignetecorrection filter and with three further exposure to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous shock absorption at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting from an optical filter with a aperture of 2, or by chance to compensate a greater level of Vigneting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vignettifying correction reduces the luminosity of the target with these options. you will need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the regulator will provide you only positive values as you just need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer refine tuning of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the engraving from the & digitiation; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifying correction to an image. the original image (1) indicates the correcting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminance and contrast-correction was also carried out at the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitition is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient treats the general geometric stition of the lens, and can correct the concave or concave shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect, flacht but at the edges. this correction is not applied to the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient pair of grades corrected the remote corners to the second gradient. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometrical distortion almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value is controlling the strength of the distortion second gradient. with negative values, tons of tons can be corrected and positive values of crushed distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion 4th gradient. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the inverted sign of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient. negative values increase while positive the image increases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The injury or spherical correction should be performed prior to all gencuts or size changes. in case you are able to re-cut this correction as all of the first. in case you are able to re-cut a picture and perform a tons-shaped correction, the effect is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it into an important spot, such as the marine margin or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tons / kcible distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct an adhesive tip, the resulting image will have black corners. you can transform it with the trimmer tool in the menu, cut out the image editing or through the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the ink-shaped correction is made. the next logical step for some motives, such as shots of the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective to correct that all angles at the picture 90 degrees. keep in mind that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have an easy distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons to be applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infra-film of the GimpGuru.org website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduced the famous Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Beneath the preview, you can adjust two parameters adjust film granularity and film-sensitivity (ISO). activate the option add movie granules when you simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. ISO-regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter colors to reproduce by infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filly applied to a landscaped photo made from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the cutting-light.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & checking out; filter film granularity is a simple to use tool to reproduce film-granularity in your images. this is of classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, well known. to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers blend great silver granulators of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-granative effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere, or seems to move back into the past. the described picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. in case you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular vision specifically in your monochrome photographs, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more basins, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granary effect applied to a black / white picture. the original image is (1) and the edited (2). the original film-sensitivity matches ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digire; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses the copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & checking out; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting. natural images and style live are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to affect this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smooth, the smoothing or, from the other side considered, the uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the original is marked with the (2). Pinch size for this 640 pixels high image is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious was used; filter coal-drawing uses colour and Intensity to produce a cabbage-pattern. pictures whose engraving is slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to skate you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator chooses the pin size and the lower tuning the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original picture (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings from 30 to 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digise; filter engraving shows your image in 3-D as if it was streamed in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digise; filter gravure is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monopolitical landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and it causes it as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: similar to the wave-blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glare blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button beating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of improper effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom insharpness: caught the picture along sternförmiger lines which go from a center. this simulates the blur a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the photography photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial invalidity: caught the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal thread: caught the picture in order to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement motion: caught the picture through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft identifier: caught the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shot-sharpness: caught the picture by random shift of pixels and simulates the blur in an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color-basin in the picture and caught it without change the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button beating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. thereby it gives natural your images a nasses appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the trop. as the droplet size is not growing automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. quantity changes the number and the density of drops. fishing changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & #; image editing to keep an area free of rain drops. use the choice tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free of charge. if you start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rainy filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the defaults have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers or mirrors mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to do smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you get an image inflatable and keep the details sharp? how can you get the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here is doing a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to adjust the size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitiation, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher that value is set, the more being smoked, because it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as loading and loading are used accurately. any plug-in for photo can be saved as a text file and be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast at what it does, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load upon yourself. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo shobles by comparing a small color picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the thumbnail (2) is the result of linear magnification to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The randomly cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to merge an image. the image editing allows you to simply cut the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and tightening the rectangle then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut off, then you get a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can adjust the size of the window by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button Ocutting-button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl + + X). use the File Save File Save File save the image file in order to save the re-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">You can change the size of the triangle by moving the corners with the mouse by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In tool after aspect ratio, you can supply the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the greater value of the height and the width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to centered the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to the area to suit the greatest possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the tool system, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data are reflected the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembling help enable assistance to enable you to better put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic sections are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party rule, harmonic triangles are a way to divide the rectangle into similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that looks at various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the flowering of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used throughout the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to make your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is guided by Fibonacci 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 34, 21, 21, 34, 34, 21, 21, 34, 13, 21, 21, 34, 13, 21, 21, 34, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1. a composition that will follow this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle offers liquid guides available when you put a picture together. these help are dealt down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will enable you to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third-party rule, the Golden Spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition carries the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral, and creates a symmetric visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is called the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called Golden Triangles. it should be something that the eye is at the center of the composition. it can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without being the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the above discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden Triangles are not equivalent triangles. diagonally on these lines can place a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you generate a effect of by professional photographers and dynamic symmetry. try to place your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic part.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to grasp the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner. you can fix this with the & #; image processing and the tool free rotation. select it transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angles. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button default, you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the cursor in the image look around the two lines. now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function to cut out of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically trusting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"" "the option" "" "anti-aliasing" "" "has a little bit after the rotation. take note of the above warning." ""</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspeculative transformations are carried out by a fixed point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture. the Preview will then automatically be recomputed. on the right of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the base area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right-hand corner of the base area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the base area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the base area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjustment of the perspective the image will be a little lubricated. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adapters generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this when possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After starting the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to clean it, it is the picture with transformers to cut out of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool system is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal template, for example will move the top portion of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the picture is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you push on preference, the angles will be displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right of the preview field.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will end up a vertical and a horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool system to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have performed the lubrication, the picture will be a bit confused. for a single dification, this effect is usually negotiable twice as much as it and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After closing, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it, it is the picture with transformers to cut out of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& checking out; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write reviews. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiling. in most distributions you'll be able to edit a large number of pictures formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Q: displays only files in formats that knows. this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, then the file is displayed in the image editing. you can change this list of file extensions that end & checking. in the configuration section you will find further information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format you use. a fuller description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & # 3; supports both formats.</seg>

<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one image will be displayed. the speed of the image will be shown below. a low value generates a very sudden appearance, a high, very smooth change of image.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave them black. the name and the path of the generated file you can set under name of the MPEG-output file. keep in mind the extension possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">In case you specify an audio file under Name of audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences, you can now drink a coffee with the button code. depending on the speed of your host, you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a dip in the rest when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or use the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPO module, you can import and convert your images to one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the headlines tool dCraw from Dave Coffin. an original zapper of Him is: do not expect that it produces the same results as the software from your camera actors. sometimes you get with dunt better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted, and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can continue to work on the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera works in the RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats, and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The ged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossy LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you're going to work your pictures frequently, or you should not use the JPEG format otherwise, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF, and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as memory format, the metadata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start using the trigger button to start converting. if you want to cancel this process then you can interrupt.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, here you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier trial. a preview is not available as far as the conversion process is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all pictures into an album. it uses the convert convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of a album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the time stamps.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. these are available four types of change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: preparing the picture for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photopapiers. the target image, including background size, side size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">This KIPO module allows you to send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the associated pictures before. further pictures can be drawn on the list of the pictures and stored there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the images can be shown with the pictures selected by you. clicking the button images can be added using a file optional dialog. for the last selected image will see a preview on the right pane.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images on the picture list and add it to the pictures to be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of the pictures are removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can click with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the Betreff. the pictures selected by you are already attached to the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be sure to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of the emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send lots of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and each time again used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you need to specify the correct path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the GMailAgent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments will be put together into a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. they should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original Exifdata are added to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, searching for mistakes. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button Connect, you can click this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Moduls advanced diaschau a window with questions like you want to have shown your Slideshow. you can select here between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant picture-outputs by means of OpenGL. you must however own a proper graphics card, since otherwise the Slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names will display, that the filename of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop. you can then run it manually with ESC.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delaying between the images can be the temporary distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transfer effect. you should then check out the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions effects between which you can choose. randomly choose from any transition between images to another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to turn it into the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the preceding and the next picture and stop the dew.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom left you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPW module time & Date can still no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPO module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module is the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE labels.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have made your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & photophotoalbum; through this browses, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image are now available in each group, so in persons, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumbnails. in the following each article is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, change the browser's view. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of pictures displayed from a few thousand images to a few pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can display with thumbnails in order to view the images of your method.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before its name. you can save with & photophotoalbum; however, for each person an own preview picture, This also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view pictures next to the names, select the button which is in the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords may be displayed (if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You need to specify yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to view this, you will have to select the image editor, as shown in the picture. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the pop-up window you can customize the enlarge factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the search window in the main window, a dialog displays that the dialog for the determination of the image properties is similar. this dialog can look at the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the captions or descriptions of the pictures according to this text is searching for. if you want you can also be a date of the whole date, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here is after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are mapped.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read handbooks, but prefer to try some features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quickches, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Launch & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you launch & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu item's menu entry. as a result, some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a continuous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. one picture of this bar see you here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display multiple different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the body only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used on the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries Preview View from the database (if you select a date, the first image will always be displayed in the Preview pane) and also displays the timeline always shown the current date of the currently shown pictures if you navigate in the Preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, thus pull the timeline. if you select one area, you will be shown in the Preview View only pictures of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images. the one is integrated in & photophotoalbum; integrated in the following part of the user's manual (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create through the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First give the title of the blicks and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & photophotoalbum; -export file should be created on the overview page. nutritional information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. therefore, you can avoid that information displayed on the viewer are also without description obvious. for example, that's all pictures are exported from a party. for example, note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain cases.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are clear why they are not received specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">Bottom on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. by doing so, those who look at your website and possess a monitor which provides the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time. therefore, it can search your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, as if he wants to get a picture larger than he wants to appear to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to select all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for all of your HTML files.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible for the viewer. if you choose a URL for the basic folder after the pages are created, this folder will be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet located in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them manually. for the import function, see correctly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the basic subfolders in which all subdirectories are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described setting possibilities are all three based on basic subfolders and URLs. in these cases, a subfolder will be set, its name you can specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're at a family business, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. if you already have a lot of time to write the pictures, people on the pictures, attaching, etc., then you need to do with & photophotoalbum; this work is not even going to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photophotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import it into your database. the pictures are imported into your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images set aside and that file can pass so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can edit a .kim file either directly from the File menu or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a fold way. first, the images are not found in the folder of .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you are searching for creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following the dialog for the export of pictures is described, which you can use via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether you want to act internal or external .kim files. there are the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manuals near the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not to compress the files. if you like this, just choose the option Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page reads maximum picture size. if you want to send your friends pictures, the images might not be in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by telling for example, that each picture is to be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... select, will publish & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for imports consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the importing images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the most imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database people. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog box, which categories are imported to imported file and which categories are specified in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can import the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and to view: if you look at pictures, you often want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will pass the various steps from (1) to pass the information about your pictures, via (2) the Browse and prestige, through to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today it takes your videos. many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal securing tools, copy on a floppy disk or revisions in CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts automatically again. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, so you can launch & photophotoalbum, using the option -c. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can switch to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user guide, the different settings will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call up the thumbnail options and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in you how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the sections, classes are already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete memberships, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of an intermediary as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the settings options available to you, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, you will find the list of the current category and a list of the categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPO and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. find out about it on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules do have a help page that you can visit via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested using & photophotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using it on your own pictures. they should not say either about the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; from input\ &gt; or using the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules about KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photophotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage, if you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photophotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can use their images in albums: it's an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum, this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order after albums so you can use the functions with & photophotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">So simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture gallery at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also had to pass a list of albums. here's a photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album of the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you use for example the category people will use & kphotoalbum; so whether you have selected people and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are using & kphotoalbum; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog, and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a starting screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will not see a lot of information, as you don't see any information about your pictures. in the section we will return to that window, then just click on the entry images that show you an overview of all available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to preview any picture with notes, where you see the picture, etc. you can set each picture either separately or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper, and all images were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for Browse and Browse, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by selecting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can use them again and again, if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the moving of images within the list: if you have an example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, so you can move the people used upwards to find and assign the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and customize these pictures with notes, just click on the buttons on the right and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. using the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item Various entries at a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the image catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also add an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see this article in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the dialog box by putting the bodies that form the edge of the frame, click and move on. you can also make your own window by moving outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your particular needs, click on the Settings button, click on the button below to store the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also drop a frame completely. if you want to get this window later again, use the button Options... and here the window will see a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose to display images in the browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you do not have filters. you can configure the thumbnails by simply drag down the mouse with the middle mouse button. try again.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this picture is displayed in the picture above. if you haven't opened any window with a picks, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture. just select the appropriate images you would like to delete and select either the Remove button or select Edit menu. now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers a solution for this problem. you can use & photophotoalbum; for pictures also use it without having saved on the hard drive. of course you have to record the pictures anywhere, so & photo album; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails will be displayed, so that the thumbnails will show you. however, you can also view these pictures with the image above.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function, that you would like to copy files from folders and then copy them again. if you would like to avoid the insertion of the corresponding CDs, please purchase a larger hard disk in order to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, see the pictures that you want to make for other inaccessible, and click Current viewing on Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also select all the images that may view your little sister, contagiers and menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set out which pictures are hidden in the case of the case. if you put the laptop with your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will be locked down. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be inserted to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select a password in the menu privacy.</seg>

<seg id="993">The reason why you can describe all of your pictures with & photophotoalbum; you manage and describe hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & photo album. you can preview them from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The spectator you can see in see. it obviously shows the picture, but extra all the information you have to enter about the picture, such as who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily drag and drop them differently. all these options are available after a right-click menu. all these options are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the matching entries to this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you were choosing people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back by pressing the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a deathau. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it's a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is used in full-screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can enter the image in the image and zoom into it. with the minus button you can take a rectangle-zooming The Plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom so that the picture is not zoomed. with the equator sets the zoom, so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Keep in mind that the only zoomoperations that can work with videos that are in-off and zoom with the plus and the key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screenshots from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose name you may have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the interrupt and configuration dialog of the picture to insert this name. you will perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and consider additional pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the chance to look at pictures with characteristics, while you look at it. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the respective letter A, in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so, if you have selected all the images you want to edit. this is described in detail. then you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you just want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the thumbnail. if you want to display categories in dre thumbnail, then you can press features to the images by pressing the text for the feature when the image was chosen. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & kphotoalbum; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on the painted one. to switch the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; just switch on the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the folder you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully dominating the documentation, but the documentation too & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire model - views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of a already selected object, since all subproperties are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the item and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following switch-up menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">When you've modified properties, click on to apply these changes. if you put invalid values, a message is displayed with a bug description. then you can click the input errors and then click on it or terminate the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user Guide in the furnishings dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the indicated object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL Program Guide to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the House's View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-image opinion and a small sample of the scene is selected with the selected texture. as presetting the entire texture is checked, even if you want to have a subordinated element (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for displacement. you can change the shift through dragging with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visibility levels are smaller or equal in the toolbar of selected visibility.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window assignment as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window order or if you need a different order, you can set them in any form. you can also save multiple window frames and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">In order to anchor a window above or under a given view, drag the touch to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows the new position then.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the touch to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to rearrange several views on one another, drag the touch in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tabs top in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window parameters are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to remove a view from anchoring, drag the touch to the desktop or click on the little to the left top arrow in the fibre bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the fibre bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert extra views into the main window. in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views. new views are scrolling, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save window size... Save. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window of window under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">When you have created a scene, you can renders it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual is written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click on the icon Renders The symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the returns in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to renders a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels, you can make any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of full models of highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in the View menu Render modes... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that allows the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box card size you can list the width and height of the rob image. if you wish to rename only a small area of the picture, select the cross section and enter the image cut into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the binationsfield Quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; to renders it. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex woruser reflex lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user's manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is terminated with just one Strahl per pixel, various errors can be created. these images often do not show a fashion pattern or overtaking effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive; recursively, because every pixel is always split and adaptive because the recursiondepth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray is pursuing a beam size. if the difference between the color values exceeds the neighboring pixels. if you set the depth value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points are calculated, at a depth account of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the dyes the predefined threshold, then the pixels will be split into 4 subroutines that are individually further followed and checked to further sub-division. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the low depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, altered & Povray; the beams ensure a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental capacity of & Povray; which computed diffuse Lichtreflexion. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the related rays do not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; it's output. when & Povray is finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & poray; scene to import, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command-catching of & Povray;. when in the import messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support code text in & kpovmodeler; import this code text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can export objects from the object tree in the Editor to export the code text for & Povray; this adds the code text of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is renched. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the self-picture view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. here, the path to your documentation and the version will be supported. here, the versions 3,1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, altitude) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you will also have to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first-found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for checkpoints. the second color is used for display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the triangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catching of points to the Raster menu in the context menu of the wire model. you can set here the Raster separately for displacement, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values make a more detailed wire model and thus a better switching for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detailed level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you intersect the high detail results for extended projections, all the wire model views are used. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projection screens. this property yields a better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you overlook the wall, a wall behind the objects is rounded. the wall is shown in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you indicate soil, a floor is located below the objects. the floor is represented in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate cantor reporters, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for renders of the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window systems. in the window of window systems, the window of window systems can be explained and saved.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinationsfeld Standard-Window System: displays all existing window systems. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window assignment to start the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window systems shows all existing window systems. a new arrangement can be added to the button Add button and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views of the chosen window Rules. new views can be created with the button Add and remove selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with uniting the window under the existing window, with card card, you get a box card together with the previous view and fend the view not in the main window, but also generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just got & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully note the following warnings, before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black screen.</seg>
<seg id="1080">When you do not insert a light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black screen.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following display rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item processing. with this, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera. if they click on it, see the contents of the image properties, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user manual & Povray; find out more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera in view points can change with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press Enter, the wiremodel angles and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could add a quader (inserting body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is an awful method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object-tree, change the name and then click the button or the input-button. in the object-tree the new name will be shown immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view also shows the level, even though at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the level extends as far as the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree accurately, you will notice that you click on the icon on the bottom. in this case, you will see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should postpone the ground for exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. choose the shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something different at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the picture view (name = ground level), with one click on the button Preview will see how the pigment now looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Preview of pigments only shows a matt black material, because you need to enter settings for the pigment, so remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not preview the ink at odds and then click on the button, then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Now the material for the floor is set right now. if you click on the icon with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color that you have expected. here are still other settings needed. in the color list, you need to edit two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently but the chess-board list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree everytime and change the colors in the view of the Object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to perform just as you should understand the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should already understand the ball as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: at 1 (do not forget to use the input leak or the button (otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground to move a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results in now a strange result: as before you see, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you chose the ball, you can assign it to a material now. as already at the bottom, type the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in ball pigment. then click Ball pigment, select then einfale and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can attain more complicated effects when you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click to apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gleam effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed finishes, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you are & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you traced a scene raytracs, the renderer disables from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect such as fog. so the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source you see also nothing, the image is simple black. obviously, each scene takes you, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler; you have created a file.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a file, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage can be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only choose if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the last undown command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used any other-way.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to modify the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add a dialog with this option to edit or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove commands with this option toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove them.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to manipulate smoking finishes without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a Bump map and for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes, which you can use as building stones: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object paint on pixel basis, by applying an image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image classifier and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists the files you can see with clicking the & LMBO; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image should be displayed in a separate window or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply tap the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the lower right corner. if a suitable filename is found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pushing return or Esc;</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue - & kuickshow; there are five cards tickets. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can adjust the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two other, short rest for the display window and short rest for the browser, the shortcuts for the relevant window can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display space is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activates, loads & kuickshow; already look at the next picture in the folder while you still watch the current image. this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next picture, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; when opening the name of the recently opened folder. at the next time opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to select a background color. this is used in window to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode, the window is bigger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; so set up that just a few of the file types are displayed, which can represent the program also.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the display window is enlarged on the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or using the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between the image change at a slideshow. to change the value you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. is this value to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is thrown down by the user. to change the value, you can use a new value in the input field or use the sliders right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Here change the shortcuts for the different modes of operation & kuickshow; in the cards shorts for the display window and short rest for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">This option allows you to switch between the two-part view of the filesystem (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the unused view of the filesystem with folders and files in a window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays great symbols for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in short-presentation.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other KDE programmes. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, player, playlist, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlist and scripts. such:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the headlines of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarohas still has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback, if the script should not be executed due to missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and take advantage of dialog, so that the user ID is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin at "Resundum 'Rescue LoadError error =' Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. '' dialog '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required functions. you will soon find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the outrun of external programs and commands. for this, the function Exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here an example of Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send alerts on all current scripts. for this reason, string will constantly monitor the standard input of script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure automatically displays the script to view the furnishings dialog. to store the store and loading of the furniture data, each script should take care of each script. if a script is started, Amaroputs the working folder to the folder where all the data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange is signalized that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for example; with DCOP functions to request further information to the new piece (for example, the metadata or the denomination).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newvolume signaled a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing Menuclicked: submenu-title, contains the path to selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry. submenu and itemtitles are also handed over to remove the script to remove an individual entry. to remove an entry you dcop Amarok Script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu item).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amaroads, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to work for example. this includes the storing of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that have downloaded the user & b. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which can optionally be detected with bzip2 (.bz2); for example the user can clearly see the archive as Amarook script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages right right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main kript must be executable (+ x), the remaining to the ladders should not be executable. use the Tar-Parameter -p to get the file right:</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package Cdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs so (including the programs included), because & Amaro; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts. we have written a small guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD predict that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome is thus functioning, but fluxbox will cause difficulties. we try to support Amarin on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can check the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amaro.kde.org and also hang out the caputte file that has caused the crash. afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, this is that day-lib by reading the meta-info from this file crashes. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you are using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries were compiled by & Amaro; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok, but with GCC 3,3x was compiled, then this leads to overthrow in Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then you disable Automatically off when inactive for... in the setup of the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backups by email (the e-mail opens automatically with a crash). if it is a common crash, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program data as UTF-8 to write meta-information, but this is not as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described about the What is that? -Help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. he is prompted to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you do not use files for a multi-session CD. it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders using existing files.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function prompted & K3b; to remove files from the current project. all other files will remain in the project. this function does not remove files from the medium, they only ends the previously imported files back.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the copying-copying dialog. this also allows copying the copying of a CD to another medium. alternatively you can also just want to burn an image of a CD, which you can then burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of the Klonens instead of normal copying. you should prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD Copy dialog. this also allows to create a DVD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also want to burn just an image of a DVD which will then burn you later. besides, there's also the possibility of converting a DVD with the help of copying dialog, so the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data from the source media in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the instruction program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional design, therefore more your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which of the contained programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions can be used to make sure that & K3b; then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & KDE; -program measured, supported & K3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -a leser for & KDE;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many codes (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (compressor free compression) will still need to be added from the Linux distribution). further codes can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD are read, read and stored in WAV files on your computer (lute-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually a pro title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the luluous FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. nearly every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggins (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile it. however, only the codifier packages are installed to be needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format is intended to use? the chapter Welcher Kodierer is a little introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While the setup dialog must be made (the furniture dialog can be found but as often called up until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of a & CD is explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) for understanding the slim approach of the interface, which will be frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different cards cards (such as encoder, for setting up the Encoders). so, you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter outlines sound quality, radiators and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lucent audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any other commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information caused by data compressing according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at low bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences are less important as both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still available with most distributions free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high quality quality (with high bitrates), but compared with OGG, slightly deeper quality at low bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a machine based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG subscribers is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"--preset medium" = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces accepted transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car models. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be fetched manually or replaced by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / be used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program for creating the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of programs for the code and this parameter here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switches to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; Title to the keyword (English: day), when MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added to lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator; the result is as follows: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= Knock-name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs to enter the information by yourself. it is noted that here only by text is said: & CD; Title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the landlord: so that the author is meant) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; any information can neither be added to the artist nor the music company. all the information can be obtained in case of a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physically, or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively an interrupt field (sending an address). for the use of freeDB may be used with another (counterfeit) address as specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address can not be used by the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB will be used, the geographically will be used on the nearest mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually issued monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which lesbian program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that are used cdparanoia; who wants to know more accurately, look in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD. see, considering that the cdparanoia package from the suitable distribution must be installed first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The storing of the WAV files can be selected by the codifier and therefore the desired file format. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lucent free compression for audio data) on the tab of the Kodierers. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution, before the codifier is required. this is also necessary for the predefined code. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter World Teacher.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a cooker, more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). in this case, "lame" must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the type- and readjust on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio code of your choice (lame for MP3s, flac & etc;) installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas what you want exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your machine. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is considered not completely free software. at least, it is not necessary to compile source files, whatever you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you try to possess it (eg. by trying to copy something inside the Conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for every extinguishing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding codifier to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we divide the program using the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read them on every reading of a & CD, if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation is handed over to the lesbian program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device designation. if this is not working or when more than one & CD; / DVD Drive is available, can also be accessed by the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General settings. here you can not do much. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything will be shown / typed as in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of complete information inquire, so you will be informed if data is missing from the indications of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet Explorer & CD; to connect to the Internet, so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, will be a & CD; entry will immediately start reading the & CD. this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the filename or filename will change with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; day.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, if you want to manually enter it: if you do not want to manually enter it. you can use freeDB locally in the offline mode if you choose to use the database before. however, these two choices have to be selected, at least the first one. the mode will be set up on the following cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeDB for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section on FreeDB. put everything in the screenshot now.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed among the hosts. however, this setting will function as a first attempt to work.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function incomparably what the server regards, as there are many firewalls to bounce the protocol of 8880, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send a CD; data to the freeDB server. the first cross-field should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously taping pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author does not know it, therefore simply try ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: please tick this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you want this ticked, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files is available. if the field is not attached, the files in the private folder will not be created. don't forget to make this folder if you want to make yourself something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All just enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something needs to be kept right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the compression rate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry "--id3v1-only 'for the restriction of the production of tags at version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2' tags may be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'ID3' Day for & KDE; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, it is trying to bode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That is it, we just finished the basic set of & kaudiocreator; terminated this configuration is used as default for every reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described as the process of lesens the & CD; on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. first, the folder structure, the way the music is built on the hard disk, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described here must be repeated for every extinguishing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD, which is not yet contained in freeDB, the screenshots will see a little different from those for one & CD; with successfully deleted from freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually enter, instead of taking it from the internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done so now the & CD has to be defined in the main window, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD has been identified; can be identified as audio CD and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you search in the section questions and answers for help or go back to the previous section regarding the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD was removed from the freeDB, all tracks of the pieces are already completed, and the name of the artist and album are also shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window built, and you can select the database entry in which your opinion is best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the crossfire for the automatic retrieval of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger it by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'News title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into the input field 'News title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidimell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful retrieval of data from the freeDB the CD-Editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can't just start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all the words with large letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1-tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tag, you have an unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the Kodierset settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the files later on with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coders or file formats. see the Help for the code in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD. for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will be back and you'll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the item's fields. give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered the front data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB alone. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album can be displayed about the unit list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each row of a piece. only the titles which are so marked will be read. simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button to read selection out of the lesbian process, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab assignments to switch on the order window. it is in the upper left half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the lesout of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece out, it is finished. but we have a new record: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. hence, read and code parallel. notice the status of the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not find a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that is configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and code. when high-performance machines is the result is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous outputs and code (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file of one & Konqueror; window into the & kmid; window drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry play from the menu item or press the idols.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts, once you drag it to the & mid; window. (with multiple pieces you will be added to a collection and then played on each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece is playing, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click on the arrows left and right of Tempoindication and then change the playback speed. to get back the original speed, double click the Tempoon LCD.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out which events are to be displayed, and even better: the event type will automatically determine which a song is used, so you don't have to set up the karaoke text automatically. however, you still have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other species.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to define an event type, select from the menu Setting the entries text events or songs events. the same function also have buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played in the row. in this section, how you can make collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then set the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the threads in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you quit the application this collection will not be saved. concern that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the button Add. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding is activated for the collection, a piece by opening (using file opening or drag and drop) are automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu button sequence of the menu, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove songs or choose random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selective list of the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump one song further, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or push the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the button previous piece, the item previous piece from the menu item or push the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select there the collection and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter as it is saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Typical Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you do not need MIDI Map because all Soundboards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI interface is a text file containing all required compositions for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP... name of Keymap... "END Define KEYMAP... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END, that the end of an section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and neither line any line for any of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to put all the notes that need this instrument to place the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a gun (GM patch 127), which is similar to a gun bag. to do so, carry the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If so, a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun bag), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Druel patch the patch is meant that each tone is another percussioning instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) rather represents the one in which the tone means the sound height of the same drum (like him own keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how tnotes is shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP paragraph, the order of lines is very important, just as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple Keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to tnotes tones on the perk channel. take a look at the supplied Keyboard as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section may be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel expires, simply do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion to a particular channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the N website. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is required to use the name Name for this channel. if you want to use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, then Patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Option Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perk fold patch on the perk mail channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitch ratio is shown in which ratio Pitch-naming events can be multiplied by the value n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to be no decimal number in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM announces that a keyboard, which is to play a keyboard, which is to play a pitch higher with the value 4096, a tone higher to play. unfortunately, however, try to find some keyboards up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI interface, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel screen is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these pids you see which sounds are currently playing.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button does not shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sewer view has (until now) two different views to display the players' notes. the view select Settings under the point of view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g., a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the speed, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I cannot force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compressive ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binders (rpm, deb) of & kmid; which happened because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example of kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder that you want to add in & Konqueror; select all the files and drag them onto the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow key to the left of the Temte LCD, in order to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & KDE; -desktop feature a & Konqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or want to play a file, just into the & Konqueror; window change and the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file fast without adding to a collection, turn off the setting automatic adding to the collection and the new; file is added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files Amid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open a temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do not escape, also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me that, continue to & nmid.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred compounds under the menu bookmarks, but this is individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category of thumbs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you have an entry, his group and all his sub-groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updated piece ', TV and permanence playlist may also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do if & kmplayer; not going through an editor, but also by applying itself. simply click on a name of a category clipping from the menu, and as next editing mode. by the clipping of a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected from the menu, and select either the box mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the insertion mode is left or another group selected without the playlist of it.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>

<seg id="1718">The animation at startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be annoying at the end-animation, however the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favourite picture: & lt; bodygt; & lt; IMG Dur = "file: / / / / / / / / / / / coil; and lt; / coil; and lt; / coil; are in the directory testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (presumably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one the only works). for this reason, the videoforlinux will be functional for the X server (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config) to be included in this configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1766">Master's document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a Master's document the work is simplified with other incorporated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set into project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & Latex; code text is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if no mistakes in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File course: in this mode the DVI, -file on the cords may be repeated, and it is not a call of & Okular; after the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">For viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection of boxes should be finalized. the selection fields were designed for fast insertion of joint elements into the document. the first selection field is for the fast structuring of the document in parts, chapters, sections,...

<seg id="1776">The brackets following the command\\ Documentary class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. the fonts may not be fixed at the beginning, this may also occur later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was typed, the & Latex; -source code will be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or of the button quick.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved in front of the compile. & kile; apply the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Slaughter the compiling of the document should be searched in logging of errors. when using quick installation, & Okular; automatically started. this is not the case, should likewise be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text, which is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font should have been created and only a few merciful should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} sublime. the order\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} ermapped.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Results are permitted only within the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}) bered. there is no description (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to brighten the readability of readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, fat pressure, cunning, etc. these commands may end either by command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for trusive-pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be noted with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>

<seg id="1785">Once the background is represented by writing the source code with the & Latex; conversion language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit text was typed in the assistant should a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. there should be a quote, a few places in the fat and Kursivprint and a poem can come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed can be returned to the editor via editor-View or Strg E (with the internal viewer). in an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI, file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an inherent file format (engl. D e V ice I nings). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document. (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document using Drucken (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI, -file has been created from the & Latex; source code, the transformation can start into curved other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The anticipation look for the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex files. this includes only modern under settings Kile set up... tools construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To apply the pre-search search, the mouse-cursor is positioned in a line of the source code and then be clicked on preview. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; the viewer takes place immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; it must be laid down; in & Okular; in & Okular; (settings ocular setup... Editor)</seg>

<seg id="1797">The recording file lists the error source in the source code. in the editor you can then use the knock-like LaTeX bugs and nests between the errors. to view the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the logging line and & kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the corresponding button on the toolbar button appears, a window appears to choose the template for the document. the features provided are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">For selecting a leak document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Distributors of & Latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates houses in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you must create an existing & tex; - / latex; file accessed or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template using a document of an existing document and selection of file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file new, some strings can be replaced by other data (such as name or text encoding). these variables may be configured in Settings box.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering documentary class. typically, they will be used as follows:\\ Documentary [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$]</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard, and the executing of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then your own template can be eliminated instead of the default size.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made out in the menu tools directly out & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; you can go there directly with reading the chapters work with the editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be accessed through the menu LaTeX-reference, which can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with penetrated Strg button to wander the & tex; that means that in this way by clicking on\\ par\\ bigs, only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker, the text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated conversion, some parts of the source code can be washed out in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibilities to browse the most different types of sources, and to emphasise it. for example, the & latex; commands of the normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants would be able to use some bookmarks inside the text. this is a separate type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu entry into teasing or the last jump is highlighted, so that it is automatically reflected in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent features have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code; specifies their selection. under editing chairs the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Coat a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines). with a paragraph it does not mean a text with permeating rows (like in other Texteditors). this enhanced meaning may not be shown with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source. the only preventative thing in & kile; is therefore that the precipitation separated by two blank lines are separated.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has a latex; commands with a wider star (\\) and an additional star (*).</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, a part of the document may be expelled at this first and by wires of the key can be removed. & kile; offers the keyboard navigation device. & kile; offers the following commands for a faster result. among Edit removal are the following commands to include the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of any type of sale.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for NF further commands under editing surroundings for an exceptional working with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command the cursor moves to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to pad the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you can injections to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed just behind the command to the gravel of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located prior to or within the command\\ begin {environment}, is injected at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many devoured environment commands may be lost quickly to the review, that command will close the last fired environment, so that the devoured environment structure will not be scattered.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by braces {...}. at Edit TeX group are a few important commands to match to those from edit.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command this command will move to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curated clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will move to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly close clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curated clamp of a & tex; group # is located, the other end of the group moves (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many devoured groups, parenthrents can quickly be lost during the review. this command will close the last group, so the wasted structure of the & tex; groups do not scaled.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we begin with the Edit menu Edit. so the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all of the plug-ins and adding new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location, & quantaplus; this path to the seeking of the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relationships are each other. & quantapSaul; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project like both team managers and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose himself from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by pressing the team member from the list and replace the button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fett after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and the setting of their own identity are important regarding messages and notes. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by the collection of the members of the team: it can be created an event for information about the team managers if something happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later someone has saved it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that is added to the CVS as soon as it becomes added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page's configuration, the Shift; F7 Project Project preferences Dialoges can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the address given in the recipient list. the address sat can be a team- or subproject leader. see in, wei such ladder can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Note are special comments in the documents. you can distinguish themselves from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To give annotations is simple. either the note -entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation key word in a commentary area followed by a description text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Any remarks can be sent a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (Spitzer) or @ annotation (role), plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leaders Head subproject leaders should be introduced to the respective divisions or subproject names, as described in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nickname and roles names are independent of large or small-ups, but spaces around the braces and the: make the comment invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be called up via Settings Quanta. this dialog extends over a few pages that are handled in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantapSaul, including tags, including car complete can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / shellation of tags: large / small-writing of automatically insert tags. normal Groß / Mini-write means the tags are inserted as inserted in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Mini-type of attributes: big / scription of automatically captured attributes. normal Groß / Mini-writing means the attributes are inserted as inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard Dia encoding: the coding of newly created or in other respects as with file opening files (where the coding of the file can be passed), but this setting is deactivated from the same into the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD was not recognized. this option here will be broadcast by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantapSaul regularly created backup copies, so that with a blackout or crash in the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for even stored documents, a backup is updated regularly, according to the time issued.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), which makes it possible to view the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse-click on the structural tree, the following action makes it possible to change the action by clicking the structural engine with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural-design settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the actualizations of the tree in editing and how deep in changing the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such, in which the current document no element has been found.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Here you can manage the plug-ins. plug-ins are part-part applications from third page, which can be reused by any Kpart-capable application, at the most known & Konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin, if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this activated, then tested & quantapgia; whether the entered information is correct. off, the storing of the entry is also available when the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantapgia; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting function was completely newly developed. DieSupport for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as the support for the dbg Debugger. instead of which a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which allows various implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquire.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a fitting debugger plug in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger Plugin, the specific settings may be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantapgia; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the contents of monitored variables is displayed. appears normally in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is usually displayed. appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plugin with, on Debugangement. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which has a debugger, so that normally do not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Start the session. includes the connection to debugger or ends the buds to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to submit a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger to start with the execution of the script and updates on the monitoring of the script as well as the currently fixed line. if this happens during the script, the execution continued. happens before a debit requirement was started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information to oversed variables and the current line number. if this happens during a script running the execution continues. happens before a debit requirement was given, the execution begins as soon as an requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger carries out the next statement in the script, without entering the functions or Includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger carries out the next statement in the script, with it being possible in functions and Includes in.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger to move the statement and go to the next one, as if there was the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variation-view.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML, whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as the only element type themselves nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tags is a script function. when you use & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments that are transferred to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped the elements of a list. it can occur for an attribute description only once. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute of a tags inside a dialog window. this day can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once (for example, once for each attribute; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All of the TagXML files must start with an XML; -declaration start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 Encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be tidy and closed tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do nothing, but watch out & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; Tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files the Tools dialog is up in the & quantapSaul; window to start and check out TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently unavailable. currently, the check only takes place while downloading the TagXML files in & quantapgia.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example of a family 1 of the XML file. this file describes the & lt: diagram &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2027">This action weighted keyboard shortcuts. by clicking the User Database can be assigned a keyboard shortcut; with Kone, the current keyboard shortcuts can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. there can be a text in the determinated settings, and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the mightiest action type. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). ourselves are the Quick start dialogue or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir / share / apps / quanta / scripts / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file is removed: / out of the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantapSaul; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantapSaul; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods you can accept a script of & quantapgia; in the default input. in the selection field, you can be determined what to send to the standard input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected part of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input also the output of the performed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output posted on the standard version. error messages posted on the standard version of the output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written on the Standard edition, using the value shown in the selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar using the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you must add and configure promotions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add them to the fitting toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, in case the tag Attribute has and you can plan their use, enable dialog "to edit" tag if available, so that an entry when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igored! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the menu-bar;, graphic Further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting knob as a symbol. by the use of green (green is usually seen as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled, that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -Day in the current document will fit.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this will pass through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantapSaul;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Click the use button and continue with other tags, so there are still, or confirm with OK to finish.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantapologies; functions to the toolbar icons, or it should adjust this to a better overview through some separators into several groups. open the toolbar settings with the toolbar. set sure that the desired material toolbar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the separator (from top left) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar button, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to get access to the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as separators aid the grouping. anyone who knows my toolbar, could believe that the & Konqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. once NeueXML does not exist, there will be impart subfolders, but your toolbar button (n) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantapologies; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be in the & quantapSaul; -repository if somebody has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search a existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. then you let the first part let you, the second we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 4.1.html Day 2 = tag2html Day 2 = tag2html 2 =</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see the documentation now in the & PHP; documentation is something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Version of Contents = index.html Getting Started = ivox.html = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntactic .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the shaft stiff (except reason) mdash; but try out it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequential at the top end of the manure & mdash; folders displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do nothing, but watch on & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource-files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the section of the docrc file, which is designed for the design of the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP, script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of supported separate context-elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantapSaul; -Repository for the use by the & quantapgia; -community. they will not be rich of it but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">You are not alone. it is possible to share the twisting resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places there is one by e-mail menu entry, like DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, the following menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantapologies; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and usable for publication. to ensure that there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the subsequent users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will be asked for their private GPG keys (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can choose a. in the dialog New resource you need to stay empty) and by clicking the OK button will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD (DTEP) to upload the toolbar button and began in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigates & quantapgia; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature. in case of problems, it can be broken and then it can be broken down. please note the warning messages and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantapSaul, but it can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files will be necessary in the tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Download and Convert a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. afterwards the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string, which is made in the! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / ree.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantapgia; after converting the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantapSaul, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to understand full benefit of & quantapgia; this chapter is trying to get familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapSaul, the workspace is divided into three parts: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, who uses & quantapSaul, which is checked as globally, stored in the common folder structure of & torantapgia; this enables the group of administrators of different workstations, actions and patterns in the global tree will be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS, patterns to workstations specially for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree, which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantapSaul; MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the Edieireonites with information and the toolbar. please see, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the cardboard boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document password, such as close the current, other or all tabs, revoke, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in Editorarea lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document file, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copy / insert), processing of under the mouse-cursor keys, help to the word under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file, when the string is referred to a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editing window, the toolbar of Editors. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 transitional as standard is shown for the one set of toolbar cameras. in the course of the further expansion of & quantapSaul, the toolbar are adapted to the new functions and associated users needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar button is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, such as & lt; then click on the icon that represents the day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day. should they have a day that has several attributes (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The manic views (QIT;) allow it to open and pass through information; in the representation of Karteireonites are available for files, project, templates, documentation, attributes, and documentation of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantapSaul; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by means of a right mouse-click. actions like Adding, removal, loading or deleting the files from storage media can be performed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantapgia is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what kind of connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only applicable to the respective users and templates projects are only available in the project. more on templates will be found.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the spin-off in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button are available, such as the script to start, edit or send it by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view you view the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document on the position of the item. by right-clicking it opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it can be varied attributes and namespaces change. based on the content of the information system, the change of all available attributes allows you to modify all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the Web-technology for your development. you can download the packed documentation for & quantapgia; from the quantapologies; 'documentation site you can create, and by adding a Ordinary doc to a project can conform to project-specific documentation, to be edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, it has two tabs at the bottom of the window, via the beneficial information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta running script. so the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & QuantapSaul; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantapSaul, extensively expanded and easy to understand. indicate a symbol and they get the respective command displayed. the Chocolate cabinet of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantapSaul is the ability to send a toolbar with enamel. & quantapgia; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar-archive via & kmail; and if they receive a toolbar in an e-mail, they can assure them in & quantapgia; like any other you can backup and load it!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantapSaul; it has a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help enter. the options are easy to understand and here not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble passing urine, you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 am folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in the PATH is in front of their bin folder. same thing applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& QuantapSaul; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantapSaul, was optimized for a quick web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the endeavor to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers of & quantapSaul had to deal with an obvious idea: what would be, if & quantapSaul would? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest Web-development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on reines & HTML; limited, is & quantapingly; well, it is far along the road to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarise: if you can define it in & XML; then should be patient, then be the suitable & IDE; to be the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above requirements need to be held that & quantaplus; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & KDE; developer community is based on the idea of free software, the idea of why develop, but allows users and developers, & quantapSaul; so to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequencer @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file which is not located, where the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check out the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project preplacement, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting out of the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; -scoping, so that it is displayed correctly and will not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting reference.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -closing, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is used primarily for inserting & URL; s in the anchor day used.</seg>

<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantapSaul; projects are saved with the file name .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, e.g., to copy video files into your subfolder or subfolder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantapSaul; the project is managed. in the chapter & QuantapSaul, you will find the details explained.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, such as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed. all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift; F7 project Project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file will be automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantapSaul; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you get the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary) or an IP-address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets you empty this field empty, the default settings of the selected logs can be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adaptation may be necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles you can upload high launderprofiles (see in) as well as the display of a tree-view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing an own construction supervision for every profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, one can switch to event promotions and add these actions to modify or delete these promotions, if a previously specific event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>

<seg id="2182">Enables removal of the current profile. if only a profile exists, the button is terminated to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in memory and fortable it. this possibility is useful when most common loading of files is needed and the rather insecure password can be saved on the record.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantapSaul, many high-size profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto several servers. at editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domainname or an IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and installed Kio Slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacking shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so that it can not be easily read, but each with programming results it can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbar. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar, can be stored, opened or deleted through the Settings toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantapSaul, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantapSaul's own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are sketchy in & quantapSaul. the best using the toolbar can be used. the adding of the toolbar will be treated at the bottom of the section of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu (right-click on the toolbar button), in which a new toolbar can be executed, changes or toolbar can be executed, what actions can be specified in the dialog, which actions can be displayed on this or other sub-toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, you will also remove the entries to remove and receive action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up the toolbar settings and set settings according to settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially related, code sniff, code cutlets and files for shortcut. & quantapingly; used in principle as a common filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or preview any system already existing in the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you put on the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantapSaul; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template, prior to usage exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, i.e. pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using linkages (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates. additional information on the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. you usually make special rumors for the purpose and organizes the work in proper fashion to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful when not a new document is intended to be inserted in documents on a template but the same text range. you can find everything from a comment on a final note system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates will be organized for entire websites than templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, compiled in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template as a local template store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happen, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project position) the submission is not visible in the project-tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select Text in your document and click File As template Save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged & drag to the construction of a template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a substitution folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and storing or inserting through the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files construction-view on a folder right and secure site template, secure a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projections allow a very purposeful operation. you can create headlines and footers or dynamically with & PHP. you can create files or link with them. additionally, you can keep some things to keep in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates and files. each of these folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu Properties. the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection panel with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is abused as soon as the attributes of the attributes have been aspiring.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the tributaries in the template overview. if a root folder would be set in principle, unless they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear to appear with something like text Tree. if nothing appears, it is probably in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permits the referenced or later text for templates in this folder. these could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and enables copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footers, a whole presentation already available with headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally you have a context menu (to show right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& QuantapSaul, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor, which is accessible via the Settings menu. the first mode replaces the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor, then you can edit and turn back when needed to source code editor, in which the changes introduced in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes both in the source code editor and the VPL; editor will run and the cursor in the source code editor and the VPL; editor will be activated, this mode is already active, the button moving out the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is configurable via settings Quanta setup.... According to select VPL; View you can select between synchronizing according to one click or automatically select. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time period. basically, the recommendation is: a small amount for fast calculator and a large pan for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, making tools documentation. this means the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; Editor is also called once a new document is created with the VPL; editor. it serves the reduction of the suspension code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags, the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down, e.g. keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not yet supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It's possible to include an external CSS-style system by pressing on the file open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like in a text-processing, possible by means of the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be typed as usual. text can be reactivated by typist or revocation.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar icons, as in the source code editor. it is noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor day, surround it with text, every other callout anchor must be removed each day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar as the tables assistant or the Listen wizard are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists are used to be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are lots of graphic tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors to make a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text at the same time. a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a great deal of conflicts when performing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare fast text, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function the much work was that was the same and assembling of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way cooperation is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files when running:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Gdiff3; also helps you compare the same and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder connection:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Gdiff3; displays the exact difference and serve them with the possibilities of today-wise color monitors. if you have to frequently check the code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines are only shown in a certain number of white signs, one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no hassle, if someone changes the objection.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make yourself the type of animal work by writing only the filename of the first file.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Semitic 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialogue allows to manually enter file name, selection via the file browser (file...), or selecting a recently opened file from the list box. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be empty.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or assembling of folders. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If clashes have been crossed, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set a output file immediately. you can get this step later in the storage.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup -button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start using the same / connection.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & wediff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialogue you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop pulling: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains for example several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these features are, they would have to generate two appropriate files, them in & wediff3; download and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: right now you can draw nothing from & wediff3; only the pitfalls of text into a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and storing of text into another program as outcut and paste (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each textbox is the info line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line. then a little bit of the file will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to the letter A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preference may be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees at the color, which file distinguishes itself. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the constituent column. if differences are found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programming languages, the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separating the constituent column of the text is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines. when the line is activated, the line is shown to the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparisons) also has an info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [changed] if you have dealt the result. usually, it contains in the automatic connection already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the storing is disabled!!! (use the buttons springe to the closest soluble / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group belonging to the line is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also indicate the current group). this group is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes you don't have any more line left in the group by automatic editing; then no row is displayed in the quest; no row is displayed in the file. this text appears either in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may perhaps copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; tightening conflicting; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you choose from the sources the options are ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the run-runs and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys on the right, beginning, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the apple window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button you can switch between one-one and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns, the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as previously described in the section) and the editable image window has been explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-below / Strg-image), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image Adown) or to the next / previous conflict (roadmap) as a conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts can be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg-Insert). if this option is automatically copy, automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is automatically copied, because you could overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeileners are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix-variations use a Zeilenvorisk\\ r\. Kdiffusion 3 reserves the line-out of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved at the finish and restored at the next startup. (menu Settings- &gt; Kdiffusion 3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are shown in recursive writing. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be shown. on these systems, the button preferences automatically marks an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the appropriate number of spaces is inserted in the box of the tabs button. otherwise, a spulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press or return, the insertion of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any selection will automatically copy into the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type-end-type you prefer for saving. the preset value is the common standard selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files are tried & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines can be ignored in source files. only during this first step, white signs are compares. the second step compares every line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. even when taking a white character, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a wagon range '\' at the end of a line, others again save only a row-predictate '\'. if this option is enabled, wagon range may be visible, however, like a white character. during operation, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after still smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic rejump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white characters using the selected file is used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters occur in many files as a source. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or ignorant C / C + + comment.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter to scanning folders and persecuting a conduction. look for details under documentation related to the directory comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">When a file is stored and already an older version already exists, the original version is the Suffix .orig. if you already exist such a backlog file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further securing.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting to the language of the interface. changes this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop & kiss and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the upper settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection of the encoding for the coding appears a brief reference, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters will be treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have dealt a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not function with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off in order to suppress types of changes in white characters in the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignorant or ignorant C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences between two of three files are shown. after selection of A & lt; -gt; C, A & B & lt; -gt; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second supervisor column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the space available on the screen for a long time. blends the less important windows (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Ranks the comparisons between one another or another to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts assembling and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for output files. (when this function is used to restart the file, then the name of the last file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is passed first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preferences, which matches your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut a disruptive parts or to correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the line-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind is to enable the user to gain more flexibility in setting up the Diff results. but for this, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command processing command to convert the entry into major letters: sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / '. * is recorded in this context all characters in a line. the\\' s transforms the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use a few keywords automatically generated by typed text strings (info: / cvs / Keywords substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\). the\\ in the $is needed, because $a special sign would mean and end the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you like these regular phrases even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion 3. but it is well known as an example for another pre-processing accessory for Zeilenabine. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple requirements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e -e's / REGEXP / substitution / switch. however, perl takes only some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the advancing '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and concooperations. further operations just change the data that can see the line-off-off-algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the file-file processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders replacsively and together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to collapse; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the assembling and displays the simulated changes without them really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions with either all (F7 button), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and assembling individual files very similar. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folder will be merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merging. to start merging, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder, you will receive a little news window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files listed until then were compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder of the scan performed during the scan will be shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally presented together, clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the icon or clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and flaps up all subdirectories with which you can catch all the folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will start the same and it appears a comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the co-operation action can not be automatically selected. if the merger will run, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, are used in columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow, and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical returns the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. with folders, the age is immaterial for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf revelier, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old when it is old.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same type (e.g. if A a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories are synchronically active. then chooses and kdiff3; the necessary action is identical, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: to merge and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after the assembling copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folder will be merged and select the option New File instead of conduction (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. If such mistakes are not removed, the merging of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the co-operation, a file becomes a file after the other. you status column shows fervor, and correspondingly other messages, when something unexpectedly performed. if the operation is completed, you should make a final review and verifying whether the status is fine all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When it is selected in the furniture dialog the file comparative method is selected, Cdiffusion 3 further columns will display. these contain the number of uncomers, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the straight-selected record (file or odds), or all the entries at one time. if you have selected all the intertwins actions (also in all subfolders), you can run the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have any target folder, then it will be used in a three-folder running mode C as the target, while the two-folder merging will be chosen as target and used in synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all the entries are to be displayed in the target folder but also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options caused by the particular entries. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all the entries together, select directories start / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only perform the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting data types still exist invalid, a message appears to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog window will appear with the options running, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate when you just want to see what would happen without the real change. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then executes certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge with a single file), then an assembling window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again directory start / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a proper dialogue will appear. then leads & wedge 3; his work with the next entry will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & wediff3; on a mistake, a message and a detailed state information appears. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to transfer the cause of the problem. if you select the merge again (F7 button), lets you choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually combined, these entries (in the current session), and carries them together again together. even if the clashes have been overthrown or not saved again, these entries will be deemed to be done. only if you change the clashes, these entries will be re-combined.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Setting - &gt; Kdiffusion 3 setup...) now has a section called directory-together with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match to the indicated pattern are displayed in the elementary tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (eg. * .cpp; * .h). the folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. there can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. there can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a file is marked as hiding. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared, on which the links show. this is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to Folder: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folder checks and recursively check. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions lead and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics column. (the number of soluble, untenants, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower compared to a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if they are applied to files that no text contain. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster, just change the change date and the file size. however, this speed display does not cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changation date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. for example, this can be useful when copying the change of change. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the sync mode when two files are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals for the merging of files are identical. also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of the merging the newer file is suggested as action. (this will be considered unsure as it will not have changed the other file. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">When a file or a folder gets replaced or deleted by another file, the original version will be renamed with .cg extension, this will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of files. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the Folder eyelid view can be visible from the merging of individual files; you can switch the window-window with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the option directory & textwindow to switch main window in the window menu and switch between the two opinions between the two opinions.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu, you can also merge an appropriate menu entry. as soon as you save the result, the status will be put forward, and the file will not be re-combined when you start the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status goes lost, however, if you read the directory again: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports networking with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiffusion 3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line is compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line is compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undounding. or.. .This is not possible with URLs not possible, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mask. (# - &gt;% 23, idadline &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be distinguished if a link shows to a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to modify permissions or modification date. therefore, soft the permissions or the change date from the original. (note the option trust in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as differences spectator in KDevelop. KDevelop starts at first the built-in differences-viewer. to start Kdiffusion 3, press the right mouse button on the Differences viewer and then select In Kdiffusion 3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files does exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can select on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiffusion 3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. moreover, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & wediff3; when part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiffusion 2 (now Heist are compact) there are already. additionally, the name Kdiffusion 3 already indicates that it can carry together as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for very long and have learned a lot by being viewed in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who are gone to this path or go to this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not have the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configuration, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (eg. diff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs vary, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines keep next to each other, this phis, but this sliis of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this important information is required, however, if the result is easily saved as a text file, and it's much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was up to date. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly is coded; no src lint; published and the text does not fall out. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Gdiff3; used already many colors to give rise from differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & Cdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest modifications can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file ChangeLog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Around & kdiff3; on a system with & KDE; install and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker uses, you should not have problems with compiling. nevertheless, difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Umbralt-Remove) to the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or Umbralt-insertion) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replace the current market.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show differences: files that appear in all folders are not identical in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences appear. if the target folder these files are not already included in the target folder but if the target folder these files do not already exist, they are missing in a later program version probably.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. underground differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a mini-show of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the desktop areas to finish their size, to finish it or move it. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows within & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked upon, when on an empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has only clicked on an application inside & kpager; however, the context menu appears as well as the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, on desktop and end. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if a application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if a application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this cross marked field marks, you can move windows within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in the & kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Ticking this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual desktops will display. it is attached together with name, the names with OrdinalPay is provided, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspace will be displayed to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click once the mouse-cursor has a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who prepare pain in the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and those of each mouse-click pains. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may hurt pain, which are associated with the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To get it clear again: even if & kmousetool; pain thus helps with the mouse to be caused by clicking the mouse, it is against pain, which can be caused by the light due to the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result may vary for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse click once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent version is enabled, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is running the push of mouse button. in this way, you can run the finish with pressed mouse button. in this way, you can run the pulling with pressed mouse button. in this way, you can move the drag button with pressed mouse button. the smart push requires a little practice, but you get used fast to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This devastation period must suffice after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse-click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is intelligent version turned on, the turning point is turned into (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button waits before it returns the mouse button again, if there is no box due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click through mouse-displacement. this function is enabled, creates a slow reference to the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow converting to the left and back leads one double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt. this moves are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt files; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move and KDE; to move the reaction times. click on Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the answers.</seg>

<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings back on the values that were set in opening the dialog. have you already pushed the button, the settings will be reset based on the last score.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular the intelligent box you should first switched off. if you then have accustomed to the automatic mouse button, you can later push the smart push.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it will be necessary to decrease the responses of & KDE; in case of sound lengths.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse-click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not constitute a link, does not imply any unused reactions. you can therefore use the mouse in such locations until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse ruelt, you should purify your mouse. that's usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must remove the mouse ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can be easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; when it's just started to run the intelligent version, it means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot stop by the slogan of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you're & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can even execute a mouse click here. this is done by the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want it. however, you can hide the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to give him a keyboard shortcomings flowing out. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent version, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart push is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it in the clipboard to move it into the clipboard and to re-insert it into the clipboard. however, it will likely prepare them once again. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent box if you just start to start & kmousetool; to use text instead as follows: perform at the one end of the textfield one mouse-click and hold the move-cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this becomes all times when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when in the intelligent version the expulsion time begins. later you can use the smart tanning available without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you need to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker, and they are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; betrotates the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor just persists. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and where the lint of the Maule pain is prepared.</seg>

<seg id="2591">Before you are able to use program Speech dispatcher, you must install Speech dispatcher and set correctly. see also</seg>
<seg id="2592">At the first start of ttsmgr or as long as yet no spokesperson are set up, the carton card will be displayed. see also. if you have set up at least one speaker, the carton card will be displayed in general. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Most TTS-synthesizer offer different languages and voices, so also different male or female, or such that is distinguished in volume or speed. you should also have a speaker set up for a synthesizer. you should at least one speaker setup before you & ktend; use as the program speed dispatcher otherwise uses the standard speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Different speaker for the same synthesizer are comparable with multiple printer sposities for the same printer.</seg>
<seg id="2595">If you click on the cartonbox speaker in kttsmgr, the map card is displayed, then automatically when you start tsmsmgr and still no spokesman is set up.</seg>
<seg id="2596">All the previously appointed speaker appear in this list. the favoured speaker appear above in the list. the top speakers will be used for voice output if an application is no spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2597">With a single click, select a speaker from the list, and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Click with one mouse click a speaker from the list, and click on this button to change the settings. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2599">With a single mouse click a speaker from the list, and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down. the sequence of speaker in the list also determines its priority.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current & kt. system.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Here, select a vote type here, there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jungen- and Girls "girl to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2602">If you click here, appears on the new speaker icon on the map speaker. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Now you can use & ktts; already nearly use. go back to cartography card General and check if language versions activate (KTTSD) to enable them. now, you can use & ktown; click on the card card assignments to create and manage text messages. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2604">If you have at least one speaker, you can start the voice recording system of & KDE; click on the box card, to open this card card. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Select this connection field to activate the & ktend; this starts to enable the KDE-TTS service (KTTSD). this start is successful, the card card accepts orders and you can read text messages and read them. see. remove the markings, the KTTSD, and the TTS-System of & KDE; deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2606">If kttsmgr is terminated, runs & ktts; on, as far as the field of voice output is crossed (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2607">If this cross is marked and kttsmgr appears when you read automatically in the system range of the control bar, it disappears again, once the pre-read is complete.</seg>

<seg id="2609">With buttons in this series you can read the current text in the & KDE; clipboard to read or read a text file to read. you can also change the speaker for one job.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Click on or OK, then all modified settings are adopted on all pages.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The card card orders will only be shown when KTTSD to start, click on the box card General and activate voice output (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & Konqueror;, the web browser of & KDE;, you can read the text of the displayed website. check first if it's going to read, and select the text you want to read and select in the main menu Tools text. after a short time the voice output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a web page. you can skip this step, but then many & HTML; -preloaders and other unvisible brands are also read also.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & Kate; the extended text editor of & KDE;, you can read the text shown here. check first if it's going to read, then select the text you want to read, and select in the main menu Tools text. then the voice output should begin.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Filter for drawing software offer a good opportunity in bed; it was a good example. it is a good example. you remove the tags and b from the news, the KMail, and also the expression / local / Inbox since this can be accepted in most cases as provided.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filter is one of the advanced abilities of & kt.; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is edited, before he will be sent to Speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace wrong words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speakers or to avoid certain shortcomings of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs from four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will be translated to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the issue of the screen reader is read, the requested orders are continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the nearest priority. a message subsection regular text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can enter with & kmouth; someone who has just entered the room. & KDE; -notifications are also messages. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text messages. each order you encounter from the map card orders is a text order. KSayite is an example of an application that uses text messages. text contracts are intended for the output longer text that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are shipped in queue, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & ktts; just such a pre-reads, this issue will be held and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen repositors. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & KDE; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text strings replace parts of a text by other text. the content can be delivered as words or as a regular expressions. & ktend; is made with predefined image belts as: -) by text or for the reformatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; into a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from one format to convert into another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; available in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Spreader optional, you can send orders depending on the content of text or depending on the program, which has sent the text on & ktts; if you have submitted for example on the box card speaker a female voice, you can read text from KDE messages on it. Siehe can read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has adjustable rules, after which he is applied to a voice output. if the filter does not apply, its rules shall not apply, he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; alerts on & ktts; sent, it is edited by all activated filter, which are set down on the page. the processing by the filter takes place in sequence in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. is a filter not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed the line according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters and you will see the following optional feature dialog below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up strings, you need to insert a list of words or a regular expressions as the comparison pattern. these patterns are not found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement parts. large and spelling is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. this name can you choose as desired, it must only be distinguished by the names of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replace it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered, the filter is only used if the speaker is one of the languages listed here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse-click the & Ctrl.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Here is a value written here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID runs programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers need to wee. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 appears, you may only enter.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The purpose of the drawing purpose filter is only applied to the text when all conditions associated with an entry in the box specified filter if match. are all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all the texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison between words the string composition measures regularity in the form\\ s word\\. the words must be limited by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; outlet & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. when xsltproc is achievable via the environmental variable PATH also reaches xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker cable filter, you can send texts to a certain speaker, who is attached on the box card speaker, or to a speaker with certain properties. you can for example set that texts can be read from a female voice from a female voice. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed to the filters, there is an speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker-properties that displays the text on & ktown; sends out, and the properties of the speaker card appointed under the speaker card speaker. with the speaker cable filter you can overwrite the chosen subject.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value written here, the filter is applied if the text contains the printable expression. is installed on your system of & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; phrases installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to help you enter.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place here the characteristics of the desired accessory. if the text meets the conditions specified above, the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the stage. click on the button right to display the dialog selection.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "Speech dispatcher" uses a adaptable module-architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want to widen & ktend; for the use of another synthesizers, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; implementation filter is not necessary. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">In order to compile & ktate; you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages cutter and developer files for the program "Speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source archive for kdees, or have downloaded all night previously mentioned tarball, install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & ktts; use, check first if Speech dispatcher works with your voice synthesizer. for this, you can use the Shellcription SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; which is used the program Speech dispatcher. the program kttmsgr is to be developed so further that the institution of Speech dispatcher is made directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is dissembled into individual sentences. the user can go back to the propositional or administrative rate, repeat the output stop or break down.</seg>
<seg id="2684">When an application declares. if an application declares text, it may request the properties of the preferred speakers for output. so if you have established a spokesperson, the language of English and whose sex is female, this one is automatically selected to select the most suitable speaker. if you want to learn more about it, like & ktown; a speaker chooses to see you in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the map speaker for adding and click editing a speaker at the list or click Edit, the box card speaker is displayed for festival Interactive. as an example, the module's setup is displayed for festival Interactive. details of the modules can be found under.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you provide volume, intercom speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulators and display this grey, the voice you choose not to choose.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices will need to load several seconds due to their size. if you mark this ticking, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first sentence will be synthesized faster in the first sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this cross-field cannot be selected, you do not yet have a speaker (or forget to apply). see below.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this cross marked field is marked, when starting tectsmsmgr is displayed on the program window. otherwise, following the start the icon is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this approach is marked and kttsmgr doesn't run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to read or control it otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders placed in queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of propositions and the just finished sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID ID on the map speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will be translated to all other orders and keeps these orders placed. after the issue of the screen readers have been read, the ordered orders are taken again.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the issuance of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message subjuly normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you are & eg; just have a long text on a web page read, you can meet with & kmouth; nonetheless someone welcome the room.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a language version. this standard contains brands for the control of voices, the volume, the sex of voice and pitch. also marks for the control of the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (Britically male) because this is the default voice that the festival uses in the SSML issue.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch is set in the Festival configuration dialog not to 100nbsp;%, SSML is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and typing filters (SDSDs). SBDs are beginning to read more quickly, not the whole text order. this allows you to also jump or stop the full text order. this allows you to also withdraw or stop the full text order, even if the language synthesizer do not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; the default of the realising filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add more propositional filters, beginners will be devoid of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way to learn the layout selection by extracts. please check the speaker card assignments, which speaker works, select some properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. of course, you must have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktly; then start faster with the previous one, as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole word block, which can last very long</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause text messages to the map or break down, even if the synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal typing pattern is automatically set up when you kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be off, just change it. change anything in this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Text-recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabular character (decimal code) to the typing limits (tab are automatically removed from the text). notice that the standard profoundational filter reserves the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD et filters are never applied to & KDE; -News (kap), warnings, messages or the output of screen repositors.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from version the normal typing belt filters, you can insert this again by loading the file in bed; included file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>

<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speakers by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, enter nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; one module for the & Control Center; to enable the management of the network interface, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & Control Center; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu at controlcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, such as other settings from the & # controlcenter; create the ranges of & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module is displayed in the & Scontrolcenter; the module is displayed (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & network settings in the & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers have to be implemented and configured to enable & knetworkconf; the device has shown at all and allows the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; installed and installed. network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the files, according to the key version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded if the option is selected via network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index selected. at the start of the module network settings, it is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list that is best meets the distribution and the releasers. by flagging the setting non-re-ask, the setting may be permanently taken. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, what settings can only be considered, the adjusting is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will be able to switch from clicking the button administration mode, at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. these can be divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interface, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">You can set up the settings of the network interface by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of a button... in the dialog device that you set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button below and displays the dialog with ongoing options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system also sends the required TCP / IP information on each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP, can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual is available without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is checked, the system initializes the network interface with boats. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values reported in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device sound.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the requested address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching of a activated network unit takes place by selecting from the list and click interface to activate.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching of a activated network unit takes place by selecting from the list and click the interface to disable it...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than one network interface, the interface must be selected to the net, where the gateway computer is to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computer uses only IP addresses. if the computer http is requested: / / www.einedomain.org, the DNS will trigger this name into an IP-address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The computer is added to the naming solution part of the equator naming solution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered .DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a presentation and up-or to a downgradation in the list with the buttons, or placed under the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button mouse button... from the group calculator to the naming solution can be added a DNS server. it will add the new nameserver's dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add button. the entry then will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the naming solution, select an entry and then click on the Edit button. it will display the editing process.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named well known calculator describes a name-to-IP address mode for TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by boat if there is no DNS server available. in small, enclosed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list includes some known calculators some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses are available. these are still in the test-conditioned version of IP must replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add... The New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has several Alias names, de button add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name of a name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog's name will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings-made in the module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, it must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distribution (mostly rpm packages) it is enough when & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and in a & console; using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical surface such as machine package or the installation utility of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile it. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, in the second part all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is given into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks is operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv5). IPv5 has never been found tremendous spread. IPv6 is expected that it is going through in the near future. this description is currently concentrating on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to assign. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workplace is the contact administrator that may use a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can not be chosen arbitrarily. in any case, the IP address can not be easily chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a special area reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore any use is made possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for the IP transmission line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP-traffic in the local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered in DSL connections, so that it is not surprising, if in case of active DSL connections, other content than fixed there is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2899">& soldier; by changing the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration of the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the statusbar. the volume can now be ejected without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & soldier; can be used, it must be followed by & soldier; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-types have to be formatted before you can be used to store data. this procedure does not require formatting when you need to be formatted. floppy drives usually apply a formatting of the tape, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape continue. all the data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting, the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the securing files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in a local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select Shechem menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings will open for backup. in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will be secure. the dialog shows the progress of the backup, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog settings will appear for review. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the settings for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can install the restore, the files you want to be restored, it can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the associated entry. it will only be restored to select the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives files and select re-establish in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialogue settings for recovery. in this dialog you can once again review your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialogue will be revitalized. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to regenerate the bandindexfile according to the belt content. this process delete all the existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two kinds of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can use the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of permanent files will be automatically updated according to the selected working directory.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only those files are stored on the same filesystem, as the folder. folder that are on other filesystems you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files will be backed up since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that will be used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshots of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of knobs files; and lt; and lt; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings at the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the belt work (usually / dev / Tape). this path has to refer to the non-recurring version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command will load load to the drive. at some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched on, tempted & ksoldier; to lock the accusation during the bandwork. possibly this attitude does not work at all bandwork drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, in solving the integration of a soldier; automatically cast the tape. use this option not at floppy stream.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tempting & kdier; the hardwareseiving blocksize for the bandaging work. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you'll have to notify the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When a soldier; a band is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is valid: seconds, with the name of the complete name of the system is formatted in which the belt has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which has been formatted since the time in which the belt has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system allows the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access the quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your machine is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is an simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, tries to provide some advanced functions with the help to filtered the protocol files of certain programs and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful features, including:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in subsequent chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file can easily filter and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting, & ksystemlog; initially started to open the main protocol-file system - the system Protocol - it will not appear, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system routing. the protocol files are usually not included in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or according to text chains. in the default setting, the selection field contains next to the filter the entry. then, a protocol-line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. select the column process for example in the log file system. select the name of a process in the log file system, and proceed in the filtering bar the name of a process, so it shows you & csystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a showy color as a protocol lines of stage notice. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched with dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only specific process (e.g. in the system Protocol or on cron protocol), you can then be useful when you want to study the output of a particular instruction, such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option On new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new upcoming record lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more information about the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of & KDE; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; system V init editor, rather known (and also named after) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init is rapidly developing to standard for the control of the program start at the high speed of the system in the & Linux; therefore because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (including I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is located below / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V init, without a reinstall and reformatting. therefore, you need to ensure that the old ruit was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init is also distinguished from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start at the high speed of the system or change to a different run-level. system services include such things such as networking, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down on the one hand unter / etc / rc.d when you need it. most systems have this file, even though there is not much use for it. you can also do a rc.serial ports / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places within the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a bit interviewed, then you come repaired by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter l -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder are not proper files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start these scripts actually from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way of making machine for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server runtime, which leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run it. furthermore, I could still have a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the disposable system services to one of the six runlevel in order to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if the entry is done by its original spline (or its position). this will only happen if they draw out an entry from the area of the disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them into a new window, you will need to select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu and paste into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting number of the surrounding entries before you can try again, add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different workareas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous version.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired run-level with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the entry button to open the Properties dialog. use the mouse button to switch between different fields. enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or push Esc to cast the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings will be extracted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are recovered by & ksysv;. changes to preferences are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have been experimenting with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter at the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to launch in the individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution run under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Deliver (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way the system services can be started in these distribution, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary furniture programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed from the respective system service (and even if they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without notice, if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can be even different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this handbook can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made modifications, you need to store them. either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry into the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cases cards, the user interface and the user list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cartoncards are only represented when you have advanced system settings. only if you have a limited system settings (Quota) for users, a carton card will be created where you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear, if you install individual settings, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password is displayed, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only, if for at least one built-in file system restriction (Quota) activates and initializes (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, for each user parameter changes, the space restriction is limited in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using a limited range of file system using a space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group's belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field primate group. furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, add adding from the menu user or group or click the fitting button on the toolbar button. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change OS, remove, change, change, change, change, change, change, change.</seg>
