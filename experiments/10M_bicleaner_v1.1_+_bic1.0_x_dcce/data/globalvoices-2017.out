although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors read and operated his sport .
in fact this country had a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , which covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ student , which covered the su@@ preme conspir@@ acy of a oil Magn@@ es which had given his interest incl@@ ined to occupy .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , everything else , it is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be the one you are and it is easily acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very f@@ aint love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me as he is dealing with its Eng@@ ec@@ ni@@ gkeit .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African , African and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one ever reached by the party &apos;s nom@@ ination candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ g person , I asked me ?
I could not get Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , Prof. Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of journalism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deep religi@@ os man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view does not coinci@@ de with the director of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; during the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ intolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for the environment for their lives , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
nor does she adapt to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those through em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp was getting its way to the nom@@ ine@@ ated Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people for Tru@@ mp have agreed because they either shared between racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke my heart almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp voters as a r@@ aci@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people to classi@@ fy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic change in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters decide from which most knows , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to win control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cru@@ el decision to look to a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look differently from it .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ d. ) WC . : as much as &quot; Co@@ vering the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; The wording of white in bac@@ kl@@ ess on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as sk@@ ating trau@@ ma ) , like the great Van Jones , did exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have always like , America is definitely welcome .
for this land voted as his president , twice the son of a Kenya , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s election is a huge part of the white America this promise and says : to Hell with plur@@ ality , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words at the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud , &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ker the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if any one , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a lonely and sound@@ pro@@ ving &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God be praised that Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country , for which his son was like , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find space in this new America .
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the music that is played at both places not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica has been playing in the community : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras , which has found a way to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and banking .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , says the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and play with shiny eyes and play in the tru@@ ce you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material :
music with recovered instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ ins have started to transform parts of the tank into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , sax@@ ophone , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local oil ologist and musician teacher for the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the beginning :
first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he never had seen before : a made from waste streams .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical power on :
the world produces around one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle of waste music around the world .
the Orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , engaging solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa then it was well @-@ known that this ship had already operated in Leban@@ ese waters illegal fishing , before it sought out other coast of Africa .
the East African countries had been accordingly reli@@ ed accordingly and little incl@@ ined to welcome a march of this species at its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised himself quickly against the ship . they linger him , one of their har@@ b@@ ours and refused to give him a fishing place .
&quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply linger everything , &quot; reminds about Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading edge of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team who discovered and followed the ship at his time .
in 2013 the ship was then driven from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded in catching fish there .
finally , it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; with this we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they will exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden since it is extremely difficult to divide . thus , illegal fishing is a major matter of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ respect of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems which have a delicate equilibrium .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ per@@ ed through bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail speed , with the information between individual countries , the actions occurred today in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can exchange among other example lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ ect activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
Fish @-@ i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in ver@@ d@@ ined areas . also let themselves discover such susp@@ ects that a ship invites its frozen fish to other ships on the way .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were travelling and possibly , whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse on the basis of such information in their ports on the basis of this information . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then serious financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is financially profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million US dollars to gain lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year because of the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing industry , cat@@ fish because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are also these illegal fishermen .
among its practices , including actions are like sailing under fal@@ ter flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , indicating the f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the f@@ ishings in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are target@@ ing the missing international co @-@ operation and do not exploit the weaknesses of a fully @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be a ship illegal fishing and a country could say &quot; You &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t forget my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
so far the closed front functions .
since its foundation F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has revealed criminal networks , which had fake licenses in Tanzania . there were ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has refugees and found refugees .
because of its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks organized by organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects the following ships .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to track the illegal ships in hiding them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conce@@ al their activities and their position . and this is why we try to cross &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be clo@@ ths of satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that combines various information levels with each other . it is said to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ alizing ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team from African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened up to the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by providing the position of each tracking vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is what does - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system will allow the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also cr@@ inge .
ships that conf@@ is@@ cated without licence and hardly to reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had a 33 % increase in fisheries services , since fishing boats to buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 had to record , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now and other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a subject object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing every year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they are now fighting against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state from Somalia made his first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the track on the wrong flag and not only was the ship without a license and used tow@@ ed networks who are now prohibited .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into the botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the take of standards against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually work throughout the world .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fi@@ erce demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , rec@@ eded the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes examine the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country by gathering itself on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return trip to Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ region Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the Par@@ ab@@ ob@@ o Par@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita , the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country has deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes himself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the term of current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official agencies .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the Government of government at its latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and profits are among the highest people all over the world ( the inflation rate will be estimated at 500 % to the financial statements ) and in which a serious and farther shortage of food and medicine is considered to give the country the chance to capture their institutional structures and conclude a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :

on Twitter are frequent pictures that tell about conflicts , as well as reports from oppression and misuse .
especially large waves proposed the news on police repression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advocates of the government .
hours later , they could leave the cathedral again but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators who stand up the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because you might otherwise see something that many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic shows the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had provided the validity of the demand for a term of ministers - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Lab@@ s to do this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ am claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your bai@@ li@@ ction !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who has made little against the devast@@ ating crisis from their perspective and rather has engaged in bringing critical voices against it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more to frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or to go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city of Córdoba .
as the meantime , adult husband told Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the peasant , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military installations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he was watching in the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
34 years of age he retained the secret of business .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ es@@ sk@@ ent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his Father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , his father was dep@@ uty president of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy and who said before a German Tribunal against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there , I had been friends with a guy who made war sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all n@@ ailed him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an ar@@ resting , you made friends with one of the ERP .
pass only upon that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you then .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - the Military Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . several days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be en@@ sk@@ inn@@ ent .
I was 15 years old and I thought in the situation I was fine . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

my father took me in a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first time and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance of the car .
when he joined me the second time , he commanded me to fold . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were .
everything of this was stolen .
he gave me a little flock of a ceiling and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
this day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were put down and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
and they are being tor@@ tured by the prisoners .
I sp@@ ells in and saw a chor@@ us on the human being tor@@ tured .
it looked like a bed @-@ bed and metal @-@ springs .
later I found out that they fortified the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was shining there .
she gri@@ eves a man with palms to the bed , poured them with water and jag@@ ged him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the genit@@ als .

the rock there was in place ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell from his room came .
I recognized the smell immediately again and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that man can do another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners have cap@@ tivated with gloves and they were to tie .
he talked to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men with the face down - all were cap@@ tivated by hands and feet .
near the entrance cas@@ ed people still in the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ hole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I denied &quot; Why have you otherwise brought about ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father was at home with it .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero looks there a man and killed .
( according to survi@@ vors of the civil war , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina zu Tode ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the Head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former followers of torture .
the path on which you came here , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took approximately this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all the possible things to come home .
back then , at the age of age I had no clu@@ e about what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was on the military myself , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war @-@ mare , a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs , which one has fought one enemy , which one has fought against .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ mare , but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my Father , the leader of the security forces in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied , and you , whom you get cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded by anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you own right hand .
for this we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no single memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of yester@@ year , on which I carried a jacket and a wheel@@ ed pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still carried clothes with them .
at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been in this crime . I inherited not a problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I anyway was there to give birth .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last vile act &apos;
now , where I am older I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you first have children , you recognize the value of a life .
you are developing further and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ ec@@ ted during the dictatorship of men , but what the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children do not escape ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put to the prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their corp@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also families who could pass on their imm@@ or@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last vile act which can be done to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced back , they removed machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were dis@@ gr@@ ded and somewhere de@@ cares - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but something of course remains always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how many people have killed ! &apos;
only to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als , including my father .
the thought to indicate my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience something again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly cr@@ ashed and asked me to what the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they defended themselves were actually well .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you brought me as a child to participate in this .
he contradi@@ cts &quot; Na then let me go . &quot;
exactly what I did .
2010 is the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a crimin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can dict@@ ate to me that I have been pres@@ um@@ ably against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the trial .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the span@@ ish to the scale of the judgment .
after four years , more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been witnesses , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial was held in August 1975 and December 1978 on crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the court im@@ planted in 28 cases of li@@ fel@@ ong pen@@ alties , and in nine cases , stra@@ ining of between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were dise@@ ased out there .

Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the chamber :

the shield with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can prolong his leadership .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened center in which man can prolong his leadership , last month witnesses a very ab@@ usive translation .
on a sign the Japanese word has been taken to you . ( Cor@@ ei@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; may be mist@@ aken - maybe it also translated with Bö@@ but@@ t &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; awesome mot@@ orists . &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertising in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake had been Julian of Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ otos . he was also who made the local time to draw attention to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the daily newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; H@@ ading drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced with a reasonable term &quot; vig@@ or &quot; ( German : &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto also apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the fault was already in the text they had been received by the translator and that the translation has not been checked for their correctness .
a blo@@ gger told as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincere so older people felt through insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our turn , &quot; said the Police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News sat with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists , which are involved in inci@@ dents , is quite cause for concern .
in the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for instance , were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents from sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors made 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of total 11 850 accidents .
this means that their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused in@@ compar@@ ably increased in the same period .
the name not mentioned re@@ porter was in the release issued on Yahoo published release of article comments to the light that prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older mot@@ orists :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So faul@@ t@@ less the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is true translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in whole Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true bon@@ anza for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to Over@@ view , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers .
thus , a French mother language should translate into French as an example of English - not by French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , which might make translations into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to the understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers , who learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees , nevertheless , the Japanese staff can operate independently . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best for the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the s@@ worn and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences that arise by mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages in particular .
some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as a jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but from major companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
Kyoto takes a serious source for its translations in the future in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the internet and television take
main page of the port as &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institut für Presse and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet user , that they could not have access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV is no longer available .
also other online transm@@ itters of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who res@@ ist the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme court dis@@ band@@ ed the parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is ch@@ opped , and recommended the U@@ ps , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access Internet access .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again blocked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ tians with Internet access , especially in times of rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ating on protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission campa@@ ign@@ ing them with cash and lock@@ ings when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I once again register for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that is still cheaper than two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ decl@@ assi@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other on @-@ line stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries out its meetings .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had indicated that local internet service providers can use DNS . this is a technique that does not answer the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or dis@@ ables the request when calling for such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third clos@@ sed canal , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which was carried out in custody in Caracas .
Flor@@ es has been be@@ aten , while he was in law @-@ growing .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV continued to show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it also has been reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : with it the Venezu@@ el@@ ans the access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current events in the country is still more complicated .
in Paraguay many girls will be slave to have a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other cri@@ adi@@ tes that were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by cur@@ ative , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which is edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not allowed together with the family that lived there .
just before they gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , one described in Paraguay that is more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes their min@@ ors son or her least year old daughter to another , abundant family . in the exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must afford to spend countless days of domestic work , which can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within the scope of a contract you cannot lift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely distributed in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous symptoms of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - Colle@@ cted witness , researched and p@@ ated .
they tried to name things by the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , is generally silent .
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is on the one hand the family who wish to complete their daughter in the belief that they could close their training , improve their position in society and make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl in himself and jus@@ ti@@ fies their exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get education and maybe even star@@ vation .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is married , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively un@@ known phenomenon occurred in January 2016 , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an house@@ keeping , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . in short , she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ean Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as official in the Medi@@ ator .
Mar@@ ín lived among them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 km east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the killed child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made that deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they signed the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; could give in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; accused Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a fast investigation into the case .
they want the Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case occurs before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be rep@@ ell@@ ent - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work .
your brothers must now go all and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday for example puri@@ fied them the fridge , plaster the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they finish with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never appe@@ tiz@@ ers , but did not get an unlimited meal . &quot; I allowed me to pick more books from the library of the landlord , as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she reminds them .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some ab@@ outs of the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him to stand and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but he did not enter@@ tain himself with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; in order they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ tee , would be able to speak their native language .
their Lord feared that they had the formation they had enabled them to lose again , explains them .
however , it was totally clear that they had paid for anything they had done by them , with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing , about which almost never spoken , are bullying and the ra@@ ils to which Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friend@@ ships in school or in the neighbourhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships emerge , I feel especially clear that I belong to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society cheap the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which you can display jobs for cleaning personnel and pa@@ ge@@ es in Paraguay .
the administrators of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city guard in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please log in .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the heart@@ land which would like to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the fibre op@@ ment turned into the ad once again :
dear friends , I found a found . I look around if it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , ¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ án@@ do ?

in the course of our history we managed to release systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were sent to them and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to dis@@ agree with that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .

bill bill attempts to register social media in order to register with the government

sixty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixteen Egyptian members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently got a bill of legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by parliament , people and users need to register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
based on the law would then be set up in place that is commissioned to enable citizens to use social media .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and recru@@ iting numbers in order to make use of social networks .
if it fails to do so , that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a donation .
the bill design , consisting of six Par@@ agli@@ ding and made in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video direc@@ ting and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is being en@@ forced when the draft is not accepted , as Egyptian authorities should decide on how Egyptian authorities should decide to register the users and users who are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary and Pat@@ rons of the Legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook is blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access information about their identity in order to access the network .
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doub@@ ted the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt related to what to do with technology .
in my opinion , they think it is that same as they may control even force@@ ful public and private rooms that could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to court proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but it is all possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the concept &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Par@@ liam@@ entary Days Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legislative court against cy@@ ber crime , which was envisaged for those who were found guilty for the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; in protest . &quot;
how to protect the Kur@@ dish M@@ ouse the Persian leop@@ ards from the war in Iraq

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the spirit of the Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that m@@ ishes through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to sav@@ ag@@ ery , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they find fewer pounds .
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only surviving car@@ ni@@ ers in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ er exists .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting side is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a recording of a large cat at camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
when trained Bi@@ olog@@ ine shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild studies on wild animals and in educational programmes of Nature Iraq .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to set up protective zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

early March 2017 , documented that for nor@@ theastern Japan is the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; D@@ reif@@ ach catastrophe &quot; from March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and a atom @-@ accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ dominant pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighborhoods Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the tsun@@ ami had gone down entire coastal cities by the map .
moreover , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived an atomic accident , already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants of their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o report from a local point of view , which has been achieved six years after that , to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building regulatory authorities as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement parts ( who will be of course , sa@@ qu@@ ai k@@ ou@@ y ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i found the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima lives at 70 percent the final light .
however , you are still trying to reloc@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ nee ( who will be rest@@ ling , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to final spare parts .
after the dro@@ pping disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in abode .
in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ations that have been held after disaster in Beh@@ ind @-@ accommodation , have been victorious in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , there have been 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by un@@ happiness , its doors up to December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y beats in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have been operating again , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y beats up their factory .
the tsun@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
in 93 , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , since only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear power zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far again and again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima is far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima in contrast can only be found 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half the vill@@ agers appeared to make it more difficult to make their livel@@ i@@ hood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their rebellion has changed in comparison to the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o magazine explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to learn more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident citizens have taken care to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents , that still haven &apos;t been done enough to disasters prevention .
how it is about those who were evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in her edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has reinforced its attention even to the situation of the evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the devast@@ ating earthquake and devast@@ ating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , which had to experience the Japan one .
from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were slightly more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare @-@ homes .
according to the end of 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas are still more than 50 years old . they have failed to compete for Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokio .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , one recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately quite small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics , which in reporting often get less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini clearly explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa tells about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazi@@ li@@ an@@ tic activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being cr@@ ushed by the police in scenic demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazi@@ li@@ ans student at the age of 33 years spent this week in the intensive care centre : last Friday he had taken him a police minister during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide took millions of demonstr@@ ators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira studied Silva , the social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull of deer and multiple frac@@ tures .
doctors made him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial Com@@ a .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the examination of the incident carried by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police minister would burst of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensi@@ fication , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole oppression would thus be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video of Lu@@ iz da Luz in the net in which one sees as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state @-@ state , Internet users have now donated to 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a portion of the costs of the medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here was the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ el@@ me Irish supported by his father because he joined the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has be@@ aten him with a stroke .
police handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where there was brutal attacks against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ eman in the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber @-@ stor@@ eys and Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peac@@ ekeeping force ( P@@ SO@@ L ) asked the police via volume control on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street is distor@@ ted by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo , specifically reported on a broken glass window to render their front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o is a title story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window @-@ disk than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing .
this must also recognise if one is strictly against any kind of damage .
here also , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd significance , and the typical violence of the military police are cl@@ ashed through head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; on the fron@@ t@@ onal road with the police . &quot;
the villages of the de@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso made almost hundreds of sugar char@@ gers in Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Pop@@ ular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ o@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no serious sugar harvesting on site .
it has been two years ago when the activities were made in the gar@@ be@@ es factories .
after gradu@@ ation , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory fell after and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mor was left of steel and concrete .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some are rarely the work .
other res@@ ig@@ s and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , rising every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry do not smoke its sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of Swe@@ ro@@ hr@@ ines , who have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were obtained .
this was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ as I would receive the sugar cane plant , but the promise has not been held .
the su@@ gar@@ s industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 in 1910 .
the message would have been a mo@@ tive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad ground@@ work had no more news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the community looked at a better time .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 su@@ gar@@ s factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the rise @-@ rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will remain per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw export export would provide around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the convertible bond in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in sugar industry began .
in the following years the st@@ agnation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane Factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich am 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as soldier , is the closing of the factory , is the word that he repeated most , &quot; che@@ ating . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would still be shut down .
so that the place is received , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first appearance of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents that were removed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , just the Minister could tri@@ ke any withdrawal .
from there the responsibilities and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the gar@@ be@@ es in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the st@@ agnation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he assembled one of his 31 years of employment .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work@@ piece producers has been eliminated .
in many cases , no alternatives for work places and services were generated , which the systems generated in the congregations in which they found themselves were created .
we will never know if the mam@@ mot@@ h speech from 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present people saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories had@@ n &apos;t been in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the su@@ gar@@ s factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted highly by Mah@@ len .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Pop@@ ular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar ro@@ hr@@ ink closed , or better said when they started to for@@ tify them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms too .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they have been split to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region again .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the provision of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty Re@@ quired bring old soldiers a rise from two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few f@@ ences and clear voice , is not a thoughtful person , yet he gives the lies he told him not .
it has been pe@@ eling it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is not lacking in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations @-@ youngsters using Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and sustain their own culture
recording a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
people from the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do so by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 the workshop manager mobile Ton@@ studios put directly at schools and youth centers in order to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ gen David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks are concerned , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance or whatever they are found in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the wind ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kitesur@@ fing first nation in British Columbia relates , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; which almost two dozen of indigenous young women were disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely not el@@ u@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the moti@@ f of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalization .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the youths learn the languages of the First Nations not always mut@@ u@@ ct@@ ory .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation is recorded , the chor@@ us is sung to the C@@ ree .
the young people involved had some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hi@@ p Hop group , who ran them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like anyone would ever care for me
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to go on earth for my days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the day when you take our Scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as a young
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead by our youth
so they can do what the Creator has determined

in the Tok@@ el@@ oter quarter K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes , that of German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders had documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic meals are usually so ordinary to them not even more striking . a new trend is turning them today in show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with sho@@ ku@@ l san@@ u .
now on sale : new with Plas@@ tic@@ ulously made mobile @-@ lig@@ aments , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department .
many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y @-@ objects , as in this case , cool@@ ed cabinet magnets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ a cooling fan magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is increasingly becoming more elaborate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile @-@ stand .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at Tokyo Train Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the compens@@ atory .
some mobile phone @-@ stands and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WO@@ W , cool , now I can provo@@ ke my mobile phone with sal@@ mon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
this interest in Plas@@ tic@@ geri@@ es can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition there are also travel balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried sal@@ mon .
other top plastic meals can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , and the effect of the post .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . for example , the sho@@ ku@@ p san@@ u for example .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &apos; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico the missing and fo@@ etus regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself .
the reporting of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , crow@@ ned the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind every bone report , behind every bone report in the hundreds of ten @-@ lived tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds will never be cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which aims to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who entered the battle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime makes us fear not only to our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers , and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as easy as milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changed &quot; ) just tells these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who looks after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who at only one day their father , their four brothers , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put forward , go and to gra@@ ves after the people we have loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a power shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me also here .
at the moment it has no income .
you are in charge of the insurance of my Father , but that does not get them out , because they require a death penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get the cause ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high risk of risks .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central m@@ ex@@ ko .
your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
disease and sensor@@ im@@ journalism I know for a few years now .
I &apos;m passing each day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the one I am wi@@ ped or sad . it acts as if a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once .
I cannot be in@@ different nor regard this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the perpetr@@ ators , if they go through the streets .
for me , it is as if they hurt those who have lost someone and those who fear they had something like that .
I see our weakness if stories come to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact of the human being is incredible for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students will be justified by 43 students in a neighbourhood called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they were not spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they aren &apos;t stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Vier months of compres@@ sing in the main town distri@@ butions : like a family with threats , it describes how armed criminal month for month money was destroyed by its business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also had had their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
the pain over never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back much when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away from each other the better .
she included her report in the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for one does not know when they will not escape or kill you .
I wondered in these terrible days , if crying , my deep @-@ rooted feelings would solve , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to crying . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence signed . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who is taking care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
what is it , in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the kittens that live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk pul@@ ses .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are un@@ important compared to pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy in which the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old one told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years before , when he only saw a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father saw that from armed men had been shot out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the pro@@ secution issued the office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand @-@ thousand stories , leaving the organised crime in Mexico and to penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we do not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data launched its goal to present the complex information behind the w@@ alled fight against drug dealers , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible form .
when a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages to which he linked , contain pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fac@@ t@@ check is important in a moment when it &apos;s about to lift a ru@@ mor or for@@ ging a for@@ gery .
but what is the year after something the first time has appeared ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to exist further .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since his first publication it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
2010 crossed a gas carriage to the village of San@@ ge in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ti@@ lt and explo@@ ded . about 230 people came about life .
after the civil war , African @-@ largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous path@@ ways of blows , which were difficult to drive .
gra@@ zing fell to the victim of the gas carriage to the victim .
paper@@ work described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op houses including a cinem@@ as in the clos@@ eness which was full of people who vivid the World Championship .
houses twi@@ sted and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to the in@@ con@@ fession .
a picture with the title &quot; The is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users mysti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of low bodies that can be mounted on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , com@@ bat@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the remote Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and corp@@ se were burned in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many have been sm@@ ashed , shot , or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ erian and trying the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo again emerged , as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo is actually one in a series of mis@@ statements ; Africa check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was brought to as a test@@ ament to mass k@@ ill@@ ings .
yet another step further bring back personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Congo are related to sources of mass media in relation to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge arose in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by com@@ bus@@ tion .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ ise posts as the following on , which comp@@ lied with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo :
this picture was written by an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which won &apos;t claimed the president of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a being , monks and politicians would have taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to use this information .
the original fee , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , were also fal@@ si@@ bly as@@ cribed to this statement , but had not associated with it the image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these wrong coupling will reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine ink has found under 18.@@ 8 billion paintings ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that have been very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , others have tried to un@@ cover the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have taken examples for the ab@@ usive use and associated with the respective countries , on which page they had been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than through language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been associated with each other ) several examples of mis@@ used use may come .
here are some cases which can now be fully prepared ( on the map in Orange ) :
card : News Fr@@ ames .
national samples of false p@@ inn@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ da@@ zz@@ led countries point out on pages or servers , through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples which are according to the metadata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also pre @-@ extrac@@ ting samples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed itself to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread at the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only design@@ ate the mis@@ message , but also discussed the abuse of the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the part of the part is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news Agency E@@ fe ( which is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; twe@@ et after the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am like this one here , who used to illustrate the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; have clearly seen no pages as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , who resist@@ ed this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by post @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

this statement was ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check @-@ page 2013 and once again 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of the Stud@@ ents of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims from the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .

even within Nigeria the photo from the Democratic Republic of Congo became a proof of the bom@@ bing ra@@ ids of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in the public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia provides two extreme example of a ab@@ usive use of the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo , with on the one hand a T@@ we@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand attempt a blo@@ ggers , the claims the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tr@@ acked because the photos of this abuse were used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar has published a job position on what it referred to as &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
these reefs are published exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors , who operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set aside that Muslims will kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other around ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , clari@@ fies that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT be Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar was given up a Being in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article has been updated in 2014 and will continue to be included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over Stud@@ ents which were made by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from now deleted news page An@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declares that the picture is not from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar ji@@ ha@@ c attack . &quot;
when the picture was later recorded in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in orbit , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ u@@ y@@ or@@ gy y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo de@@ af , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and released a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the suggestion to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to reach that their communities found these events , the mut@@ iny in the name of Islam , a greater attention z@@ ol@@ len .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ er for the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 Male ) . but the messages that were associated with it were picked up in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alle@@ ge@@ dly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ acre , presented a discussion like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the false message .
of the message which was included in the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os took place .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect usage of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ gregate and sides in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amp ) exist on the Web@@ Cra@@ w@@ ler and inter@@ connect them via image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original back of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( impact ) that goes through this po@@ ets . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussion of silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second framework uses the image to discuss , how a African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
religion are to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media there are zig people who have been un@@ inten@@ tional part of bringing the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ es this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rowed down the real atro@@ us of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures was already deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that it with@@ drew from images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise , and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which studied under for@@ ci@@ ve media to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techn@@ ologist experim@@ entation because with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat suggested , but what is actually removable from the context or to completely mis@@ used way .
an investigation of false subsidies should also consider how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used under CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) makes every effort to provide language @-@ inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ ction bar ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all with@@ stand stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words were collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists include Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the relevant language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - No@@ tice your parents in recognition of how to have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after having been con@@ sol@@ ded in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :

as Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and water disaster in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun that usually ends at the end of May , by strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the se@@ ash@@ ore .
according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and a little hundred men are missing because of the floods and keys .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to a 30@@ 4 safe place of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water@@ ways in some areas are slowly coming back .
health and hygiene practices of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands from up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ le @-@ rise , war@@ ns the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on its way .

the Air Force has made five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for transportation of not@@ ables for the residents closed in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have declared themselves to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ ed in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood protection and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue mann@@ ers need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to l@@ essen the dry food and essential goods for flood @-@ offering -

the Women &apos;s March 21 , 2017 in San Francisco , Germany .
photo of Sah@@ el Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she famili@@ arize me with her children ; she is my rock in the industry .
in the one minute we are calling for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next step we continue rights for Trans@@ gen@@ der@@ ment .
we are located in a sea of rain @-@ umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a s@@ ack@@ cloth , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ age against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years - the cream that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their conception .
it ent@@ ails me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify with it to be Muslim , on different species but somehow we all get into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is in our collective imagination so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , who do not want to fit them there is Muslim .
def@@ ici@@ encies are being pl@@ ated
I am not alone with this alone .
this even has happened to the poet whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come to us in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and jel@@ ter .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea the religion was deleted Rum@@ is , as well as the popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is made in the reduced paintings of Muslims , the western books have been colonial for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman that one should save .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ushed the story behind these pictures in the 197@@ 0s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these pictures also rise up today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative is dominant our News@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v ad@@ umbr@@ ated the reality that in the last three decades showed nine Muslim women their countries , while the US 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to carry its head to@@ wel in public buildings and to cover acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercise its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change lead .
it looks beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans who were brought forward by the slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the aim of antim@@ ony attacks and sli@@ ders .
because of these stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others &quot; .
among the 1.@@ 7 billion are
we do more than just stories in the news industry that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the s@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion .
and we have failed to form seven million Muslims in the highest level of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .
the parent &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
usage approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to New York in order to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ sts from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was newly designed to reflect the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unexpected Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ f@@ aded Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k cooking , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or put my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims share in themselves - &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to become almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ trained Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with banknotes , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for false information that have already er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stran@@ ger that uses a woman to the head of the head .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
it takes our identity as far as it is so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of their kinder@@ garten group .
usage approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ tian Church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour seen in the Bran@@ ch , that I am Muslims , when she could look through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the ab@@ om@@ end@@ ental ritual with my daughter when I oni@@ on them in my arms and present the Arab verses for the protection of the cor@@ es , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one could see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my mus@@ cular affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana Competition in Kar@@ achi with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
usage approved .
belonging to the image of my grand@@ mother is her mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal step with her sisters , as she has won a contest of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of it that I see in this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ ended paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and of a cor@@ k with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can maneu@@ ver them virtually .
Muslims means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
Muslims have to be as she sent me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; has been established , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tian Eastern dia @-@ company , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
usage approved .
belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander grandfather wept .
Spl@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan in@@ sti@@ f@@ aded by his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is knowing that there are millions Kurds and Palestinians to whose families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists have been torn by col@@ onists which have shared the Muslim world as at the match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ ster bom@@ b of the story was rejected in a century above a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir of British empire , was called &quot; hazardous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion belongs deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops that have been distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica in Iraq , to pursue weapons of mass destruction , which did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim is to know that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy is ste@@ ep@@ tive in the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name reveals itself the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that twenty @-@ hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islamic Emirate called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ush@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the in@@ dur@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tioning of our with multiple ties associated identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ dness &quot; we fight against &quot; her . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and make all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made in the Muslim registr@@ ars that started with President Bush and raised under President Obama .
it consists of penet@@ rating surveillance of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration of immigration , who takes a five years old child in his hands .
it consists in a country that bridges its borders with people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
it is the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we cast into Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists shown the North@@ western University students showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and they will judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
we are too deep dar@@ ing to pass the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we come back decades to see the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints which we have in our news campaigns .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , which tries to grasp our often associated identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See , S@@ ay region of bugs ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors and MS Mar@@ vel , The Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ally , mus@@ cular , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned due to this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that exceed 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House now .
they have grown expon@@ entially because Muslims have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago they had not yet given them : now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m worried about the realities and the story , which I was not aware of as I was as old now , but I did my daughter today to become an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ ising in my speech .
things that might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our Human@@ ity really like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , we will take place among the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred acade@@ my talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are guided and human beings created through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago the Stan@@ ford was a scientist .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of this , consciously and deliberately ask the &quot; other &quot; to galvan@@ ise , because the employment that we have created a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate dog has already being bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ l@@ art wants to preserve urban variety
stor@@ yt@@ eller , by Flickr users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported short of a different initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ conc@@ il@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written law , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already been conducted for 2015 events , the risk that small and not so small languages do not be passed on to those born there .
for the creators of the project are :
the mass extinction of the world can be avoided if we are cities to accept the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not forget who they are to belong to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the listening to appreciate , to tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format they tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they perform their devotion and their presentation to make their listening .
they call forth laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language d@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain typical customs of the narrative of the narrative .
in another event John Ny@@ mus@@ ara tells the tale of H@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explained the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ mus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ch he shares his feeling of incl@@ usi@@ veness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
you were very close to me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling are held in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own histor@@ ies .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to launch the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ porter of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participating in the Pu@@ ert@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( bourgeois front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the Ec@@ ological Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debts of the debt have also made a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial examination and a guideline committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will pres@@ et and supp@@ resses .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our retirement will not be deduc@@ ted with decl@@ ining pay@@ outs .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not to the state alliance in the USA - suff@@ ers from severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is propos@@ ing a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state @-@ view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from outside on , measures will be organised without the participation and conviction of the citizens , rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel J@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is known for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives pursued the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he has provided for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , organised in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing company produced by so @-@ called &quot; Book Spr@@ ints &apos;s books within three to five days , las@@ hing extracts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive enquiry ) ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build up movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected .
activists , artist , designer , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have site to side to look over the fog that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since the 15th of March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of Ad@@ ra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory section of his book with the title collective remembran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his liberation , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how bas@@ sel pays a high price for its stake in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we have chosen ?
what do we have given up in this process of temporary beliefs ?
the web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in jail since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and An@@ tor@@ ney N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal made of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented itself as an insi@@ der @-@ Assad administration and had knowledge of an alleged death component against their husband .
his place of residence and state remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , founded in Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ ed cultural prototypes pres@@ ci@@ ent as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross str@@ aps of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ome traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ve but of the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
this project has not yet been able to complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned how to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other in@@ mates , to write and speak English .

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads are disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ ky Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or lost under non@@ violence by the regime were tor@@ tured and even executed .
by 2016 , since 2011 , the International Human Rights Organisation of Am@@ nest@@ y International has died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .

Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption re@@ viewer head after the release of dis@@ mis@@ sal on previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted by anger on a corrupt place , where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence on the workplace of the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by four other def@@ endants in 2010 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money was from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 stood on .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s lawyer made the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume its old post as the company has no discipl@@ in@@ arity after his custody .
however , many inhabitants do not wish the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , a local institution that advocates public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director :
represents a rel@@ ent@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and it is even a rel@@ apse in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we take note of this fact that the company should also have a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act against the contra@@ sting human being .
however , the company has apparently led and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Har@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , this behavior also reject and considers the case to be &quot; contradi@@ ct@@ ant &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to another sentence , and which half of them had desc@@ ended .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has advised to become integrated into the firm , which he helped to cause damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for its silence .
contradi@@ ct@@ ory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and Student der Political Science in Brazil says , the director bes@@ ought any morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state , because he in@@ doctr@@ inated him I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to morality and to serve the state * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he has only served by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ z@@ te used the state as a hand it has an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man is tired of re@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to recall that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
th@@ iev@@ es are in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ante will remain in memory for the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , cat@@ chy , and - next to proph@@ esi@@ as@@ tical speakers .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was , when he was energetic , that &quot; a ambitious human being able to do , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience indicates that it is not so . it changes the tactics but he does not turn from his ambitions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious human being is a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ appro@@ ving :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat over ten years and came free .
and today it sets the company , in which he res@@ igned by money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ atten@@ de@@ es . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e , &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ xes or spheres .

according to information by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well known social network recorded their posts from the net , because they found the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people with Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or of the issue of October ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scripture ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of the rise of radi@@ al nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely vali@@ dated con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that usually uses Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today but the word of itself is not retri@@ ev@@ oked automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that po@@ ets in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in order to be expressed , cens@@ ored .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with the different mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written what the same letters contains , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he enth@@ uses the word Kal@@ ar .
but he asked his friends on a wit@@ ty way if she knew how he could ease his back pain by giving a word of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there have been different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that it is to reduce the hate speech of radi@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts to spread racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the degree of automati@@ cism is not understood what you are writing to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead , the post must carefully analyze and control it by checking the words below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nationalities who dissemin@@ ate a love of hate , a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , spreading the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a K@@ id and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative writing of the zen@@ ed word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his Po@@ sts , as he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished :
... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office is removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to re@@ pro@@ hibit the Li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post office does not ent@@ ail the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to portra@@ y their opinions against the hate @-@ hate .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with a hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community around advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through their platform but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ ored such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they had begun this without any local context or technical support and thus have words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they attempted not to correct the fal@@ sely deleted Po@@ sts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has ensured a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed :
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and conc@@ eive of curr@@ y and an Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook moves the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their votes and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should be attri@@ but@@ able to violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of missi@@ le , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring hate speech to his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of being cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better ongoing , more focused on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the to@@ e .
a wedding ring in the sand .

children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that is supposed to offer this practice so that the child@@ bearing age is now at 18 .
before this change of the married courts held some members of Hin@@ du@@ istic and Muslim faithful communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not inter@@ fere with , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened , despite the fact that Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights prevention , that is un@@ related , every human being under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married in 15 , Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent was , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Office of the country confirmed that since 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online Pe@@ ti@@ tionen und Social @-@ Media movements that were eager to draw laws to children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without doubt they helped to bring this result in .
nonetheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ Guide for B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s to@@ e , they should be dam@@ n &apos;t care for their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition designed for tension in this actually complicated matter , and some point came in doubt whether the opposition would dis@@ agree with the draft law .
but in early 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must agree to proclaim the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram also posted :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children &apos;s to@@ e was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after he has previously been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of the social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were changed at last . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who ran a minister in Education Ministry said :
it has all too much time and unnecessary talk , used to be the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago and this is worth almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it took definitely long enough to dismant@@ le the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ian news !
the sp@@ ens@@ of law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who h@@ ears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the indigenous Age in Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious con@@ fes@@ sions of 18 years .
the draft for the amendment of the married law was announced today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and there were 35 members of the vote .
all members who were opposed to have voted for the law .
children &apos;s to@@ e is not permitted by law in Trini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ able .
many thanks to all activists who have taken him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , with the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to redeem His promise now .
during the Adv@@ oc@@ ate attorney Paris Al @-@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite right if Mahar@@ aj is going against the law , most social @-@ media users , one would approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that only panic and un@@ consciousness can give us , that the state , our daughters shall protect them from large , hard @-@ minded men who are compared to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s to@@ e are legal in various gra@@ dations , or continues to raise the standard though there are laws that they say .

on the mir@@ rors of web sites , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language homepage was issued on 18 January 2012 , opposite to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the US , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has been the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day become more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful information as well as reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are fighting against the block@@ age .
although many techn@@ ologists are used to use moving tools for blocking website ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been absent from Wikipedia since 2008 , just as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names , thus making a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post reported IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in making sn@@ apshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so , there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot achieve the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also suggested that this step was conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ p@@ pe@@ ditions , a Mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wi@@ ki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ sides when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ h - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rap@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of one proxy address , a mir@@ rors .
you attack another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia side so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors .
the motiv@@ ate him to wear yourself a camera with himself and try to settle the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar makes every effort to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese to the international stage .
and his hometown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direc@@ ts attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook as he helps him this first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched it and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ashing pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar is seeking cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese forces and would like to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
and he should know it because he already stood tig@@ ers already coun@@ ten@@ ance on face to face :
a tiger can not inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep at sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the s@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) at his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese forces and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to catch at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India the women were avoiding with the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men within the family .
instead , they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women , that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should be mis@@ used to obtain this practice at life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a hypo@@ cr@@ ite from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and ch@@ oked by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives are also not common in the name of name , is also common among men . however , they have much less ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not come into practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus quickly became the main challenge of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al who is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working with the help of her video camera at the detection of practices , such as inf@@ ants up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and guides those clubs .
they told about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they at the same time have made them ambass@@ ador for change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , was of women who do not name her husband .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
the name of her husband does not speak according to his husband , is a custom , that they all accept responsibility and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respectful of her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not hold this is regarded as being depos@@ ited , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never had thought of this discussion until this discussion .
at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who had never mentioned her husband , before , at home , try out how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stopped yet long after the video was ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on in his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club .
many women had never heard before . some women believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with a practice in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , it means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she was called her husband &apos;s name about their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise they just pen@@ ed out , another decided to let the whole motiv@@ ate frustration against him and his family by curse it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adrenal@@ ine rush to have broken with an ancient br@@ ace , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was star@@ red , she got fear and said that there was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband to a participant in a less understanding of understanding and the situation in force was less understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini reports on how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of galvan@@ ic red dot on the forehead , which indicates the marriage :
why do women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would wear the galvan@@ ic red point , if he also worked .
he only laugh@@ ed and I heard that to carry him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not been complete with them , but they think they are now in a better position , to choose to do it in some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip on every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to take care of who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their life ; they dances and speak and spoke about things that they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , such as our identi@@ ties in our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to be able to say certain things according to them , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a p@@ ants ; they have not d@@ anced .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice , morality connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ed Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is safe to create it .
on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed a bit , the Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women pro@@ filed a few times , but then listened again to the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two do they continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now contributing to each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or the own hanging choice - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that not only is limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the people here quite quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les 1966 came to Japan for the first time .
the music of the c@@ ult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ ar@@ Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration in Japan . after some 51 years they have been here in Tokyo .
today , songs of the Beat@@ les are still sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ ao@@ ke bars and in English teaching at Japanese Secon@@ dary schools .
the Kit@@ ch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ commem@@ oration .
we all love in our house the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ pupp@@ et John Lenn@@ on should be portra@@ yed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places that are related to the band .
of course you &apos;d love the Beat@@ les , all of you have to visit the Beat@@ les , which you absolutely have to visit
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )

in the year 1966 , the Beat@@ les arrived the first time after Japan .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and fly across the Abbey Road .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ utt@@ les for the organ trading , pres@@ um@@ ably the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ham , a few kilometers from the border with Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently stressed that the organs of Sham@@ anas in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there will be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a head of gold would bring gold to old or wealth , the police spokes@@ person explained by Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia &apos;s BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on a pen@@ sive men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the target of assass@@ ination for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country led a mission to investigate these Prac@@ tically .
the persecution of people with alt@@ ru@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighboring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those that are going to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the objective of ritu@@ alistic attack , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ an police after the latest assass@@ ination of three gl@@ atz@@ ant men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district Mil@@ ange where the assass@@ ination was arrested .
Hus@@ hai Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , Student and residents of the City of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that local police are already in the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of gl@@ utt@@ les .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of smooth individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , are considered by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power , the riches of the riches .
in recent days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , the pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I would like to congratulate E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que that people would have dre@@ amed to go on the streets , and students would not hurt them from the shots of a por@@ no@@ . in which the teachers would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ utt@@ ings for ab@@ ly@@ ric purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; hun@@ ted down , which cat@@ ches to its own wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably not yet been made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese Dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) , following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that demands democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department of the State Department in China has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man , he said it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ ving in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow it or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have been critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out@@ dated .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
pointer R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway &apos;s Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government did not mean that this is ultimately nothing to do with deciding .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon to China since 2010 , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message had widespread that Li@@ u was seriously suffering , the Nobel committee brought his hope for unconditional release and lu@@ de Li@@ u , to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention he was unable to stand up his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prompted to free Li@@ u and his wife promptly from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top rating of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she rus@@ hed into an Declaration on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China lifts all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the American &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad , insofar as it may help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary @-@ Pol@@ ley , gave the message to AF@@ P on June 27 , announced that the message will urge the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the request of the US message moved a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interven@@ e and un@@ ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
to protect and freedom , such as travel , free movement and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to allow the Chinese government to impose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally , so that he could proceed in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government speaker Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news Agency Re@@ uters that China had great concern if the vor@@ tex could over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing to Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambass@@ ador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked to provide adequate medical care and to give it the possibility to worry himself from his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
Canada calls for China to grant its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , true and free of freedom for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release on 29 June on , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o keeps all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact to him .
although the news channels of France already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the festive occasions in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who want peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic progression Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat yourself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself at a statement on June 28 around Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished , had led to a harmon@@ ic , stabili@@ zing and wealthy , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be fool@@ ish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , Singapore was considered to be considered a city .
this remark also triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting , at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Law@@ yers , the State of New York re@@ marked the Minister that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because it was compared to other countries .
he supported Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody questioned about whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and appreciation to create this valuable land , we say that we are not able to be no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight before the responsibilities , a must @-@ have .
Singapore , if you are not my country , eat country then ?
the reasons that were made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended a idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he appeared inevitably , un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the main point of the issue , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers to pret@@ end Democrats , the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given to his American guests were in the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , given answers to his American guests in regard to our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ responses to rational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion , since it didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a land , but a city is , therefore to which country , belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thankful when our good K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point , provided that it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing on the blog its comment , he pointed out to the reviews that one should start to read the entire commentary of the conference , so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he studied Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
as he said , Singapore &quot; be no country , &quot; he obviously isn &apos;t meant in this sense !
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who acts as the leader of a growing generation , such as a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore was said to be very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ de , which awaits me - be I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes in it and who is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ semb@@ led the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a mis@@ leading speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements are of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am of serious importance .
why do the av@@ ala deliver its military service , they defend it only their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink human resource class ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
where the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade leads to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore was and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have been anno@@ yed many av@@ als ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked before short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being exposed and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I am sorry . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions .
on my clear position then the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ic@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans maybe cook in@@ war@@ dly before anger , if they are held for Americans , but me dis@@ rup@@ ting this .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans a Canadian flag seem perfectly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was even when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before the invasion of Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little A@@ hor@@ n@@ als to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender equality are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada also applies as the toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
it would consider me nothing if you would change myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning basically to be ready - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing , in which you can encounter .
being harmless , is in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you don &apos;t want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a prime minister of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &quot; cute &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence , with the neighbors .
we are missing the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video that had the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ ded which 2014 took power and in spite of their promises , the civil government is going to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations he makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the Musik@@ video still refers to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
within the first three days , the video up@@ loaded Video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 was shared and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , in@@ definitely how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these shots of the video referring to some of the political issues affecting Thailand over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of girls &quot; may possibly relate to the Dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which provides absolute absolute decision @-@ making for important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , its v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules often are exploited by the authorities in order to di@@ vul@@ ge activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , monitored on online content and persons who are pre @-@ accused , the monarchy is per@@ sec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pe &quot; last against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ority &quot; ( Maj@@ estic tract ) .
on 20 May 2014 the law was right in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta still per@@ sec@@ uted , their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax allow@@ ances may be .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black carriage before they bring them into an interval storage , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they have said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long detention centres , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ itate the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who was already used by coup opponents during protests 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Asia .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
post @-@ war company reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Asia , particularly in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ German war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strong visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ en@@ ava are in the hydro@@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ an .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Amor@@ asi@@ an , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked in both directions in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and di@@ ch@@ ases are now living in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ k@@ asien also spirit @-@ cities .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirit cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the population was 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely gone over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story t@@ ints of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are tu@@ cked and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he begins a conversation and it &apos;s hard to quit this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , all of the community served .
now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
people who lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas which are still located one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately go back .
&quot; our mother was forbidden to leave us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply banned us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her girlfriend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish @-@ mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ x .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ demand ) such as cattle @-@ breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable @-@ growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the District government provides for free candles and bread in the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
about ten years ago , a older woman moved with the name of Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya &apos;s , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left behind Ab@@ ch@@ sia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial help from her daughter and insist that she is instead supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives .
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells their story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; she said , We could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as scientist in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds of the de@@ fle@@ es before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ sia broke out just off ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillar in Ab@@ k@@ asien ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a little while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your man is working in the coal pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they will keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any job and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy has gone to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another young j@@ agt back from it .
he plays with the ball , who then eng@@ ul@@ ed the hill .
a group of children are now following the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ aying buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure eternal life in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot;
Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

A@@ my Br@@ acking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and will be published here with friendly permission .
along the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old of Mex@@ ic@@ ans , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink brilli@@ ance and gol@@ d@@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears .
it is located Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact a fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian that are on the passage .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with a high @-@ story walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haiti migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; mom Africa !
where are you from Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to decline .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs which they can not pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama was a appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ beard ) , with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to travel to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , the hopes to get to Boston , to return to her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard by other leaders of Mama &apos;s Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together the track and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction workers on construction site of the Olympic Games and the World Championship team .
when the Brazilian economy became more weak@@ ened , he has started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to gr@@ ins or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were incorporated in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants will be sold too expensive .
he has started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are here , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela , he explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I have crossed the border of the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people will help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
having lived for three years , he was rejected after a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ e , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he had fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and a well @-@ known , a all@@ ot@@ ted , has offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the walks , the travelers kindly ask their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most from Somalia .
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gi@@ cally because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ mother blows her in her album with a lot of photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ s who has made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old .
she laughs with me while she presents me shortly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ eron is &quot; repeated every time it has gone . &quot; you have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on its phones a surveillance app .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users and greetings to them .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the phone users at Tian@@ shan district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the District Government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to the terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but G@@ ò@@ n@@ ought to use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they were short after they had replaced the app , messages with a private white chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution paths of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as below :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service sector with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online frau@@ ds , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; government actors or even h@@ ackers might be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China generally focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is quite often dark for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet recovery .
that on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from the China &quot; ( after the reservation of the boys ) , the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos from a check@@ point , at the polic@@ eman the residents in@@ discri@@ minate as if they were installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ano ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification slow@@ s that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they might be det@@ ained for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have comp@@ elled people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of the imprisonment by the rest of the awakening technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( some of the members of the post , he has been published , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are to be found in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly to minim@@ ise a response to the instructions of the City Council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi for a regulation with statement to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs until August 1 . their &quot; personal ID maps , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards to register with the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist video &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action is violated the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and provides pen@@ alties for a whole row of other possible claims , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is showing his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ate that you are all alone in one place where everything has disappeared .
everything has gradually been dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable both inside and outside .
one who makes her name all honor .
one that has expressed themselves in a list of feelings and expressions , which does not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get out the reality again and you are behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even though the Earth is spinning on the axis of the we@@ dge . you &apos;ll realize that you are caught here between the walls , who have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that didn &apos;t yet make me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the security services it formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his power over us under evidence by even destructive concepts that we have known .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it arose so that the city started the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was still , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is entitled to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down something after the power supply in the quarter were stopped .
I broke the silence by writing several times &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice res@@ ists through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to walk together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined to me ; we were connecting with a glorious picture , which fulfilled my expectations completely and fully .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free to the spirit from the bul@@ b , but you just are not in the bar@@ ley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed himself .
then I got the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you your voice , after you pulled them all the way up to the office of the safety service of the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear as you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ors filled eyes were set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dre@@ z@@ est what to look in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before that building .
maybe it was on my p@@ ie , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my job when I said , &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look in my eyes so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest possible conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am sorry not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies in sol@@ itary and his father the same with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is up to now in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months .
I shou@@ ting the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I tra@@ ge with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office that leads through a course to the individual cells .
I pret@@ end to all details exactly before I super@@ v@@ ise the room .
otherwise , otherwise they probably shared a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and must immediately put me down without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I accessed an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first in@@ mate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay a resp@@ ectable man aged man who sees me similarly and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the Perfect darkness we don &apos;t see any striking facial elev@@ ators , and doctors are not there here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers relate to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately listen .
the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would hate him if I stay .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which wor@@ ships at the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the w@@ ells , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that introduced us to the Gre@@ ys in person : Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
that was the secret to protect us from us : to protect the state security before us and preventing it to us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational memory card and broke the narrow eye field of their world view .
this is not a house , this here is not a land ; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared about the audi@@ t@@ orium and encounter on Abu Ima@@ d , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions , which he gri@@ ps him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this diary and protest against demonstrations , which anyway will find an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to not answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and beats after a friendly conversation for me became an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me told me to be im@@ min@@ ed at ease , to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing done to earn these punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all their variety .
his command is to mine as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that is probably taken out of the clo@@ aca .
thy h@@ or@@ ker rejo@@ iced at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot rest@@ rain your w@@ ells .
my w@@ aging was not yet enough , so that they inter@@ ed the pipe through a cable .
during my first time , I asked if the investig@@ ators had worked earlier than tr@@ ash papers , or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables connected to each other to showcase us the , from their perspective , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them change when I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard to cry out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favor in it , which is why it was next to an elec@@ tro @-@ invited traffic .
flow flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ sharp body , which lay down on the floor was the perfect power ladder .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the ache was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to put myself asleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the brightness meets the space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of a exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my Father is required to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and walk away , you will move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me away ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he conduc@@ ts on his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can leave is a cigarette between its fingers or its with ni@@ cot@@ ine cl@@ ine lips .
he lives in the chief floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine to flee , in which they lived as rocky ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed activ@@ ist that faces the conservative majority and scrut@@ ini@@ zed their old opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , who often deals with topics like ori@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all these subjects do not only exist in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ay , but also in cities that vary from Damascus to the whole to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not exist openly , he swe@@ eps against the US American foreign policy a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of second generation &quot; - even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think because of my own circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while in water is dissolved into two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is scheduled for Muslims from dawn to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do with a sen@@ sing called Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically , the slaughter of hot coffee and the vou@@ chers of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if one casts a look into the neighbouring countries .
from therefore , it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - in order to land not in jail .
recently the State Department of Jord@@ anian has canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , for the second time already .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Bro@@ therhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fronts is contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert tab@@ by .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &apos; had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also affir@@ m the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world unless an old or author@@ itarian legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to stand for a intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clearly marked cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs works clearly to the preliminary .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender norms to glue that he made his vision of the fate of Arab women , who have imagined sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently down @-@ known woman whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan , the number of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its climax the number of volunteers in the year 2016 ; however , it is still emerging that Jordan has not lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women , victims of murder or domestic violence against women who were victims of women or domestic violence .
according to a law for breaking control from 1954 , women who are exposed to risk @-@ driven violence , &quot; to be held at in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman is nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for this , not shy away from themes coming in his country for long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is argu@@ ing that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is his music , which is full of explicit ass@@ ays on sexuality , freedom and expression , and cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I became bre@@ eder policy , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lav@@ al al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core leaves .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ adi . &quot;
in this song a verse repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what one wants &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that little someone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were not cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember later that his comments were torn out of the context , and his opinion has been cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ es , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ g that was later to work once on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ es , was openly able to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why is the Jord@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new , that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive votes are brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an intelligence service received several former government members and members of the teacher association , with the ration@@ ale , they would have critical about the problems found on comments in social media , which are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country .
given that is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to what is the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jordan Valley .
for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan took M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , printed and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
at the end , fo@@ amed ha@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreams of not only dre@@ amed of his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be guided through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , exten@@ tions and artificial kind . at least he hopes that .
until it has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to res@@ ist and therefore resistance to res@@ ist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ travag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories on the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
we suspected that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory means that the v@@ ans , the drums and the dancing is mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , in the northeast mar@@ ched in the northeast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ y to put into his knees .
we are in the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could get some great seats so we got a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I look around for a long time to see the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two cars are just going to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival offers its only perception - and in this way a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high rock @-@ car was amazing .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair trading .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us the most important harbour , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rates , where road @-@ smoking and illegal drugs are all day .
one published in April 2017 , survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to constantly more norm@@ als in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers you can create these lav@@ ender hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the outer limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the cont@@ ests of the hair@@ dres@@ ses de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts on each other to show who from them can create the most ex@@ orbit@@ al L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to catch young people to get out their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and obtain education in the hair@@ dressing tools , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can grab a job , which is currently fashionable .
the school offered special educational workshops before the school began in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the church and district where we are very proud , because out of the love of the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love @-@ Let@@ ters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ening

the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; love message to Gu@@ er@@ ep@@ ac@@ ulture , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write notes to people whom we know ?
is it not even much more important , people who feel outside and feel affection ?
this question went exactly to the two young Colom@@ bian activists by the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ a por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people are encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ lla &apos;s letters .
only recently she was the country of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace pact with the guer@@ ri@@ lla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which is the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to be the sub@@ sign of the peace contract as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize .
a long way before Columbus is still a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that have lived for many years in il@@ lic@@ it camps have been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and all round the clock having their weapons in themselves , have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who has become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , has to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , these are now in their ranks and support them to build a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian began to join together and help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did , until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that should then be handed over to personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , who took place in February 2017 in Bogot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian , had the opportunity to speak just with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this declared that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Valent@@ ine , thousands of love writing , but those forgotten they need much unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plan , he continued to share in this year his love with people who were most urgent .
so the plan was written to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; these letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is prepared to make the discourse of a war history to a shared history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ co and Bogot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would give me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ á .
the members of the F@@ ARC were wondering how they had done earlier to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support for people from all over the country .
it was a very turbulent moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the policy knowledge student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca describe this unforgettable experience .
after we had passed the letters , a former warri@@ ors led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa Com@@ bat@@ ants .
when I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , anyway , and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they say exactly ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I response to a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I response to it . suddenly , I ran the tears over the che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him completely and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ch .
perhaps he was too sorry to write all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else from life than war . the F@@ ARC had never imagined , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers to hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that is waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
in the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion together .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state to develop a political party , we can help create the society more righteous .
for a purpose of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
these people to hear that had never heard hearing and no electoral law , and to recognize that people , which I have often seen as a mon@@ ster and even hate them , even people with beautiful emotions which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Kolum@@ b@@ ans was rep@@ lied that after dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC is now putting at peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , we call all the defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be ahead of many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of a article that was written by uns@@ rem Partner A@@ ida Mir@@ macro@@ su@@ mo@@ wa , and its initial publication on the website OC Media took place .
the hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with terror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a di@@ amo@@ is worth over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends not only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked about what happens in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won several months ago the international head@@ lines after reports have been published , which were devoted to the wear , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic of thematic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ ects que@@ er men and put them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she sen@@ sed that she was actually a woman in reality .
when she became grown it was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow .
having experienced a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
because of fear for her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer Hel@@ fer@@ in on a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who tasted in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he did someone by whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Ch@@ echn@@ yan friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents were running through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I had just got to show a few shopping bags from the seat of my car , I heard a male voice , &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How long are you going to honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ and@@ so@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had given everything to get started and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ boards in my right wing .
OC Media : what &apos;s the medical cas@@ ements have you been placed - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor did and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office sense , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he respect@@ fully went with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I received threats over the last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of an alpine trau@@ ma .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they told me , some said to me , I must prove it by passing above without through the roads ; others wanted to tre@@ ad in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that all was only bad speech , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people even spoke to my mother on the streets .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world not only your family , but the entire Republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a strike around the neck .
fortunately the neighbors and saved them were killed .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark window discs and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after the third time I had happened , it was clear to me that there was something s@@ lugg@@ ish .
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ sees the numerical signs - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you left ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to show off their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then happened somewhat im@@ credible .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without record myself , without ID , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived at and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you believe in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which Hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room@@ number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room@@ number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , but that is a tab@@ by topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditionally ca@@ sian elements are still in me .
as much as I wish , this emotional barrier I cannot overcome .
I say always , that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually teach me how to watch the person who re@@ members themselves from their past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who are still alive ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone to eat the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that , during the Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait to wait and he didn &apos;t leave a new wave .
most probably they will concentrate on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are also still being held inside these secrets / adult men ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there would be not so many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives , or were dropped from their relatives in order to ask the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are stored there so that one can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : should they be upset , one will show their bodies on TV and claim them that they would have attacked either village or military support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ing or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I am just someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after having grown hair .
there was then nothing new of them .
they just took them away .
and this so called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken .
until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have yet been no reports before . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed those people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and performances of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ shi@@ ped my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe , already before in 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally aimed at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil ization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately left us back to the quar@@ ry time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were har@@ sh@@ ed ; I had colored lashes , contributed Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the Security Department of the Sh@@ aria has never provided me a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , there met .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otto is not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if they make himself funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed , you be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never sinned , never hun@@ ted and never batter@@ ed .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ any time kept ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the Plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he started speaking on television about mor@@ als .
he did not talk about us , but mainly on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city started to change .
he who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed you upon once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly lim@@ mer@@ ing .
OC Media : how do you work now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not a lot in the US .
apart from that I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I beg@@ le@@ ite them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ tial no@@ tions .
I have no pen@@ ny for that .
I discovered these people myself when I stum@@ bled away .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you own a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is more beautiful .
so the nature of this is purely nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to white you with foam before the mouth , that there are no cor@@ ds with them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have who , the cab@@ bage have , the Russians also have them ; on the whole planet there is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear .
I am here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who walk into the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ram@@ adan : live with men together .
do you know many thinking about Transi@@ tional men suffering from men who love men and they believe that you are altern@@ ated his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ sion .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact , different li@@ festyles .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry , I am so happy here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the pover@@ ished Arab A@@ w@@ azi movement in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last months there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the dist@@ res@@ sing situation of the Arab A@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he l@@ itt among anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful to be able to arise for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ capacity for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after which he had approached himself .
some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the com@@ bus@@ tion were so strong that doctors could not do anything else .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has taken place in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ v@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month , some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ i Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been more toler@@ ant .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family members who were helpl@@ ess on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where the majority of those living in Iran live in the Arab A@@ w@@ azi movement , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to ride its livel@@ i@@ hood .
in front of a century , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took over power and claimed 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the A@@ hi@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the locals get only little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ u@@ azi Arabs in systematically employment in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of twi@@ light , built water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youngsters went up to 81 % .
N@@ our Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director @-@ General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of A@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , completed the basic school , 55 % an additional school ended and 45 % have university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , a Iran@@ ians human @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist eth@@ ni@@ cal discrimination , &quot; leading a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ residents under the young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ors said that particularly unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of A@@ hi@@ wa@@ z new emerging eth@@ ni@@ ers and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting @-@ up process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab A@@ w@@ azi will ent@@ ail access to jobs in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ v@@ azi and to be put on , as even Arab names on the workplace are not tolerated , so@@ fter than the speaking of the Arabic language or the traditional Arabic .
given the given circumstances that en@@ end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , will propose human rights defen@@ ders before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is watching and taking notice of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not to identify with the femin@@ ism identi@@ fiers , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was a subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all the Femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women are still less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it is about what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms will still make sure that women encounter earlier or later in various fields of life on a glass roof , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware of and known to me .
I am convinced that I will be double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS men , on black tran@@ dis@@ sid@@ ents women , on black women from the Dias@@ pora , or on black women from the Dias@@ pora . if I am talking , on which kind we have been physically , mentally and verbal ab@@ used , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ se@@ tional fem@@ inists are not to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to up@@ lift their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing my lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to talk that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is a institution@@ alized form of racial violence , which we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold nature .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries are less important than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to as a migration background of the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin colour , have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as a black woman , to bear in mind the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ jus@@ tices in their thinking that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of one person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ femin@@ ist who fought me and countless other black women ever and again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a vital and margin@@ alised being in the historical respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings that also absorb through cultural assimil@@ ation of our customs and customs to drive its ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer attempt to paraly@@ ze white women the importance of over@@ hau@@ l of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to stir the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to instru@@ ct them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and to re@@ fine themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release me full and completely healed of femin@@ ism , bringing me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm , which is so obst@@ inate , that Inter@@ se@@ wage is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
it is more important than ever that we define black women to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by doing our own way in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ se@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alisation after they read these lines , please inform yourselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ ist environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm , due to my dark skin and of my existence .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is not b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed , nor ignored , nor denied .
p@@ ad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has reported recently about international efforts to solve environmental issues .
this article is again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again in the past 7 years - mostly with Surf@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request from the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to consciously make people aware about the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of reservoir , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - an subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers , rivers and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and edited .
the focus of her work is per@@ sec@@ uted , barely re@@ public@@ ised sub@@ cultures and is distinguished by the use of cooperative videos and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help to tell the oppressed communities , their stories in their way .
Paraguay &apos;s Women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their ache on women &apos;s women in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # devi@@ ating ) that reports on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
a police Com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ iles , who had become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship had passed some time and the police said , their statement would be placed to the acts , but more could you do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena in@@ ced because of misuse , the ac@@ claimed display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later , the second wife attracted its display .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are refund at all once , they are generally no support from the state .
in many cases women are also dependent on the men which they mis@@ ses . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence being reported in the pro@@ secution authorities at all .
content 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen abuse and a legal system which is nothing under@@ ni@@ pp@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation blows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ led , says my@@ stic Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher at the &quot; Centro de docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , but not even h@@ ans@@ ing the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available figures are however alar@@ ming .
in the year 2015 District Apostle 9@@ 600 ads went for domestic violence because of domestic violence . at 70 % of this it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace wars . here also 86 % of the indicators came from women .
in the ads 40 % of the women they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mixing .
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ minister in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di will actually be shown a few of these crimes . &quot; on each woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 females , which do not do so .
on any woman who will be re@@ funded because of physical activity , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay has not been independent criminal law , the pro@@ secution authorities cannot properly document how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men .

invisible indi@@ gn@@ ation and a legal system that does not under@@ takes anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the solid girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t really want it , but then after . this should be rep@@ ent for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
if I have read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are happening to subj@@ ection to men because they have dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never ever happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
being called by name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had them isolated .
many people reply to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of misuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victim of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity to it .
Victoria San@@ tos that does not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she mis@@ led them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o de C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
your wealthy partner finally got to persu@@ ade them that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads have remained with the authorities without earnings and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against their former partners who developed into an im@@ viable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied .
the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Gen@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Fo@@ under ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ insert ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original draft of the law looks ahead of explaining Fem@@ Ã ³ to an independent imp@@ asse and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legis@@ lat@@ ext was changed in a number of points to also inform members of the law that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions won &apos;t be banned in Paraguay up to five years .
the original bill of law had provided that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , who have to bear the victims of violence currently themselves , if they just ask for display and wish to receive a secure accommodation , to give up the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , Mis@@ kit@@ eline is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
here a re@@ think is to take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as a somewhat Nor@@ mal .
those who are speaking in the face of these facts makes themselves guilty and contributes to the perpetr@@ ators of the perpetr@@ ators .
we have to refund as long to display , to mixing not more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . before , parts of the law had been altered . in this case , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage was taken by domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the filing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of parts of the law however is regarded as a great retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # devi@@ ating ) that reports on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
independent media in O@@ man postponed a newspaper after a ban on a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the information minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is closed on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the Cub@@ an authorities have concluded an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage about corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he earns a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Number Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and raised in court , but later came again free .
O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had put his father , S@@ aid I@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state .
since then , he has been clo@@ th@@ ed with his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster Command , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ence efforts of security forces , including public freedoms , including press freedom , freedom and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and are campa@@ ign@@ ing to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions at both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government ministers were accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man , to put pressure in O@@ man to raise an judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Num@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Red@@ ac@@ committee , was charged from the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS recorded the Vice @-@ chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j who acts as a che@@ ek editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed on in@@ definite period after the Information Minister gave the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and numbered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were both condemned among other things because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j was also found guilty of the injury of a pro@@ clamation and the s@@ lan@@ der for inno@@ cent .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were sentenced to thre@@ e@@ fold pen@@ alties and notes in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year occupation had been imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine l@@ ending of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; found guilty .
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a damages was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was already dischar@@ ged from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court said al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , in a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after gradu@@ ation of his six @-@ month prison . he continues to release Al @-@ ha@@ j in prison , where he fin@@ es his one year prison .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; to close .
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n re @-@ permit , the newspaper looks still exposed to attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister received a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus acqu@@ ires the Minister for the decision of the decision to resume the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where press freedom was violated in the most recent time .
for further injury , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on the bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the comprehensive injury of the press freedom .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cub@@ an authorities :
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally available ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can proceed to their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can do their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including court @-@ bullying , can exercise .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the opinion and freedom of association and the right to peaceful , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing section where the most urgent needs of the continent is addressed .
there are two reasons for your medical research on site and there are two reasons : for a lack of global health , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined far more grave impact than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it warri@@ ors is director of centr@@ al@@ ors at the Center for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , particularly as the AIDS epide@@ mic &apos;s first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania he himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er R@@ W : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get , are often not well used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are differently encouraged .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you had previously had ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet .
laboratories is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in the schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all age groups .
there are requirements for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , the health care sector ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
GV : can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa on western countries , based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and gain access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , too , the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com webpage , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems throughout the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton bred in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ tons was working only by his own supp@@ ress and the question , how many sal@@ ads can get there are limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more Sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further on breeding .
patents g@@ athers not only for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as res@@ ili@@ ence to diseases , a special red or green@@ tone or u@@ ff@@ ling leaves .
in recent years , more such patents have been registered with more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton still preser@@ ves salad , he now needs no longer , since his work is getting more and more protected by more limitations .
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bro@@ ck in order to p@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go into sal@@ ads far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they with@@ stand judgment , no one can breed more a new crown , because all the characteristics are already patented , &quot; so good as possible and tries to cur@@ ate those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful about it and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has joined the movement in addition to moving in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Room Station ISS have red red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ Lic@@ ence in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more so than would the movement come out of the IT range and not the range of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyrighted software .
it was launched to make sure that some plant species and women are not protected as intellectual property so they are permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the Initiative , just Os@@ si , you can commit themselves to US breeders to use other seeds to use them freely .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eder only allow others who breed their seeds , to breed it , and not immediately stran@@ ts - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant farmers .
do@@ zens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ous professor University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si pre @-@ board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is to control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as to protect the environment .
seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , workers &quot; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by continuing seed with natural res@@ ili@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the existence of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer that is offered for example in the markets , should also know that the way that vegetables is bred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nutrition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will commit to others their seed remains free of charge . this helps her approach to patent seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si supporters can argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the available genital pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights in plant material , which is thus always reduced , inadequate , shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Board of Os@@ si , has worked in their doctoral thesis with gene@@ tical variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ oons @-@ characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ aging plants like wheat are patented in even more large style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or their colour improves up to such , due to which they prosp@@ ers and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder increased by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more unnecessary than ever since the changing conditions of climate change are much inferior to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property of other bre@@ aches , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of pesti@@ cide innovations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan which can follow any one as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same outcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees that different : 20 years waiting until a patent christ@@ ening , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources always have been a general public and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue using the best and recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton stands on the concept of pat@@ enting on the concept : &quot; we did not create the characteristics themselves .
the plants make them up themselves and as a bre@@ eder we eventually have no clu@@ e as the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state as well as Os@@ si leaders , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who has cultivated a variety as well as its own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es believes in their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ icide , the bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly ins@@ ulting . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized businesses ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant producers would like : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent .
I need constantly new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my sorts in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years prior to competition , how to make it quite beautiful in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
though the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept grows quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) which describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . for receiving the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers , and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to get on &quot; open source &quot; seed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed to sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Association Agreement to an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; License , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , because the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply become one or one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conventional plants should not be patented . therefore , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent application , the patents applied to conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent application to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based on farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting on seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems &quot; declares that the organisation is currently establishing a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official start of the official start is to be applied .
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation consisting of relief organisations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . it represents that farmers have the opportunity to collaborate on seeds , to exchange and improve seed policies to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is stressed - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially given attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clarify the people that even more are behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still the Egyptian authorities lock content on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government was continuing to report the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents violations of human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Fi@@ xed - despite this attack and the scor@@ ing of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend oneself in this part of the world , have never been so important as it now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are needed to overcome the block@@ age and not re@@ mit . we insist that our task will continue to complete .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , as illustrated by independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that of the Qatar network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI &apos;s blog consists on the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access more in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog which he taught to deal with the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , the provider of which also is native to Zi@@ ros blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photographer , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exer@@ ting physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly related to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the block@@ age through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , to lock blogs are very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ alism al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ age of the blog may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to im@@ part to me the feeling of having a si@@ ege ; an attachment , an tried murder , over@@ head at the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first I used it to post the post of articles to get the cens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ tigen walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age from vendors , through the circum@@ ference of boarding @-@ sur @-@ sur @-@ surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the cens@@ ors decisions behind closed doors has been taken , whereby the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis on which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants of dispute .

day after day , newspapers are reported in quite Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Each second day is a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b Phar@@ macy with military weapons , &quot; President T@@ emer sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air bre@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the action of violence reached in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian government organisation Global Justice had even invited the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so the publications on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on 16 August , &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new heading named &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex v@@ om@@ iting , etc . everything , which happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not include our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war resting in a country not recognis@@ es war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explained that according to the information provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we realize that a war course , if it is distor@@ ted , even so it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which really sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not civilians , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
is the name of &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand to describe violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could not complain to account coordin@@ ator responsible for the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an occasion in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in staff , education and a historic and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio on No. 16 , &quot; writes them .
extra is owned by the Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which stressed , such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeated the security policy of the state for years .
to these security policy interventions also belonged to the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in the year 2003 , whose aim is to conquer by making a massive police officers a F@@ av@@ ela and to raise a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP has led to several reports of ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux distinguished from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people after themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral threads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hidden balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police declared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ ade@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence also this incident took head@@ lines : a fruit sail@@ or died as a result of shots , which had led the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to vict@@ ories Worldwatch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Plan@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
particularly strong is the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons called on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime has been practi@@ sed .
since 2013 , these three rebels have been controlled by rebels from Damascus , under si@@ ege , which led to inhabitants on local or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ am and lead the project along with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their dietary needs makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Dire@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , making this project online and expressed his relief to win that it gains more and more &quot; an acquaint@@ ance . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ am the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge of plant@@ ing mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of the expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started out of the &quot; production of sh@@ atter@@ ing fung@@ al , &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed the mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break the break . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dissemination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by food @-@ remains ( like paper , tea , coffee shop , cardboard , etc ) to gain new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women , the home work .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts on the 21st of October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires which r@@ amp@@ es in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died , and approximately 70 were in@@ ju@@ red due to the wild@@ fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state government .
fires were also registered in the area of Galicia in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks that spread in the north and central regions of the country and reached around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths as far as 200 deaths .
according to the European for@@ estry system that monitors the forest surfaces by satellite recordings , they are burned in Portugal approximately 500@@ ,000 acres of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protest on Saturday was the demand for better performance and fire struggles by the state .
people asked themselves why the civil protection was unable to com@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ eign of the Confederation of farmers in Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ evacu@@ ated .
they did this Sunday nowhere : there are d@@ led reports from open roads that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction per@@ missions are questioned in eco @-@ possibilities with high standard .
a far @-@ ranging proposal to the wal@@ nut form , which the government had brought in the hard@@ est fires in 2003 and 2005 , was rejected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction value from case to case if the applicant could be built about means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Al@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly com@@ bus@@ tible wood , themselves as shown in a vi@@ cious circle , according to Br@@ ths of this kind still further .
these problems are added that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as inhabitants searched for information or were trying to contact anyone who was offline .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered to the people with information : they used the own civil protection data with the application of fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina in order to make the work of fire@@ men , and has been decisive at this f@@ ateful weekend in October that the server had per@@ si@@ sted , not ste@@ ad@@ fast : thereby the website mo@@ ored more than half a million access .

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful business owner

during one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the different mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short@@ comings per @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ar@@ ah , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn should the boy break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ er@@ soldier had just been killed by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ar@@ ah felt very vulnerable .
the Taliban known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ famous Taliban was getting closer .
many Haz@@ ar@@ ah left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coher@@ ent environment . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was standing in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish sacks with mort@@ ar who were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood .
at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was dominated by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded of A@@ shar@@ f in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty house on the job@@ site , on which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not frozen at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af took his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous passage along the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ d@@ ined on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum , A@@ cart@@ ons 2002 came to Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time was A@@ shar@@ f homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to need@@ y .
true , Italy due to relatively high availability quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are pre @-@ finding , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the civil rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ er is accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center if they have officially added a request for asylum - which can be drawn even a month after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then are people who have no money for accommodation , to either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so there were also A@@ shar@@ f .
but his irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ful livel@@ i@@ hoods helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af awarded its entire savings in the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ ak@@ y bite .
A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ar@@ in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the movie received the Venice City Award in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians , are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the company @-@ operated companies , including cutting @-@ shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals range far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and to the retail trade and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as any other . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest pe@@ gs on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands for stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey myself . now he wants to also help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft law , which pre@@ views that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration for a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after successful law@@ ns on the website of the authority under specification of their complete name and exp@@ ulsion .
those who have failed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison , or sentenced to a criminal rep@@ ay@@ ment .
the law , which was applied by sixty @-@ members , is currently the legislative and the constitutional committee of the parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
may another member of the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or of a bill that would be introduced in the tough@@ er Stra@@ p for the ins@@ ult of the President or senior officials .
under Egyptian law the ins@@ ing of the president as well as state institutions have already been tigh@@ tly . however , under the law proposal , such a crime would be ign@@ ited , so right @-@ right of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can hold up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen while she illustrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against military coup , which led to the bai@@ li@@ ction of elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 inhabitants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail at a trial date .
