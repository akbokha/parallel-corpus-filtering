<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact this country had a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-student, which covered the supreme conspiracy of a oil Magnes which had given his interest inclined to occupy.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, everything else, it is what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be the one you are and it is easily acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very faint love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me as he is dealing with its Engecnigkeit.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African, African and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number one ever reached by the party's nomination candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigg person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Prof. Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deep religios man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trumps worldview does not coincide with the director of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sus" during the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Inintolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr who fought for the environment for their lives, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor does she adapt to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through embodied values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was getting its way to the nomineated Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people for Trump have agreed because they either shared between racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke my heart almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "people to classify," "" "said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic change in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters decide from which most knows, for Trump, because they want to win control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to look to a man who look down with contempt to those who look differently from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (And.) WC.: as much as "Covering the White against all other ethnicities," The wording of white in backless on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as skating trauma), like the great Van Jones, did exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have always like, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land voted as his president, twice the son of a Kenya, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But Donald Trumps election is a huge part of the white America this promise and says: to Hell with plurality, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words at the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" said Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud, "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "broker the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "have Latino a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"if any one, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a lonely and soundproving "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with words," "" "God be praised that Mr. Trump, that is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was like, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is popular among the tourists -but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de MÃºsica has been playing in the community: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestras, which has found a way to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banking.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the truce you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling led by Favio Chains have started to transform parts of the tank into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, saxophone, trumpet, trombones and percussion, all made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of Los Angeles Times Favio Chavez, a local oil ologist and musician teacher for the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something which he never had seen before: a made from waste streams.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical power on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces around one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of waste music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, engaging solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was well-known that this ship had already operated in Lebanese waters illegal fishing, before it sought out other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries had been accordingly relied accordingly and little inclined to welcome a march of this species at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself quickly against the ship. they linger him, one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing place.</seg>
<seg id="103">"suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply linger everything," reminds about Benedict Kiilu, a leading edge of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team who discovered and followed the ship at his time.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of looting of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegale fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"with this we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they will exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing," says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden since it is extremely difficult to divide. thus, illegal fishing is a major matter of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the intentional disrespect of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems which have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered through bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail speed, with the information between individual countries, the actions occurred today in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can exchange among other example lists of existing licenses, news on suspect activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in verdined areas. also let themselves discover such suspects that a ship invites its frozen fish to other ships on the way.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were travelling and possibly, whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse on the basis of such information in their ports on the basis of this information. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then serious financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is financially profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leader director of NFDS Africa. latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million US dollars to gain lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, catfish because of the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among its practices, including actions are like sailing under falter flag, counterfeit license papers, indicating the fantasies, the fish protected species and the fishings in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeting the missing international co-operation and do not exploit the weaknesses of a fully-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "it used to be a ship illegal fishing and a country could say" You "" "you don't forget my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks, which had fake licenses in Tanzania. there were ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has refugees and found refugees.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies lead us rather far into the networks organized by organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i, suspects the following ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to track the illegal ships in hiding them.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conceal their activities and their position. and this is why we try to cross" "", "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be cloths of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that combines various information levels with each other. it is said to help FISH-i to find criminalizing ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team from African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has recently opened up to the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by providing the position of each tracking vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is what does - this is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system will allow the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also cringe.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that confiscated without licence and hardly to reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i had a 33% increase in fisheries services, since fishing boats to buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 had to record, the inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "also other countries notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now and other countries" "", "says Kiilu." "" "we are a subject object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing every year." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also they are now fighting against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "surely, the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state from Somalia made his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the track on the wrong flag and not only was the ship without a license and used towed networks who are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into the botanical waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the take of standards against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually work throughout the world.

<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country has deteriorated continuously, which makes himself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the term of current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; but ultimately, the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official agencies.</seg>

<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and profits are among the highest people all over the world (the inflation rate will be estimated at 500% to the financial statements) and in which a serious and farther shortage of food and medicine is considered to give the country the chance to capture their institutional structures and conclude a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To Overview, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother language should translate into French as an example of English - not by French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, which might make translations into English. this may be attributable to the understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers, who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, nevertheless, the Japanese staff can operate independently. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best for the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sworn and puzzling sentences that arise by mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages in particular.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including also the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as a jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but from major companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Kyoto takes a serious source for its translations in the future in the future.</seg>

<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV is no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online transmitters of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionists who resist the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme court disbanded the parliament and transferred the parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is chopped, and recommended the Ups, VPN (virtual private networks) to access Internet access.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitating on protests in 2014. at that time, the Commission campaigning them with cash and lockings when they continue to report on demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>

<seg id="403">Surprisingly, that is still cheaper than two liters of lemonade to buy.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEdeclassitro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blockage of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other on-line stations. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries out its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had indicated that local internet service providers can use DNS. this is a technique that does not answer the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or disables the request when calling for such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elongoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example purified them the fridge, plaster the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they finish with learning, the more leisure time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never appetizers, but did not get an unlimited meal. "I allowed me to pick more books from the library of the landlord, as eating out of the fridge," she reminds them.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "on some abouts of the landlord Alvarenga, next to him to stand and editorial from Oppositionings such as" "" "Sendero" "" "or" "" "El Pueblo" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He held them for intelligent, but he did not entertain himself with her. "the landlord had found someone who, while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again" bad habits. "in order they meant that Alvarenga, which belongs to the Indigenous group of the Guarantee, would be able to speak their native language.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation they had enabled them to lose again, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, it was totally clear that they had paid for anything they had done by them, with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminated against. "one thing, about which almost never spoken, are bullying and the rails to which Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friendships in school or in the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships emerge, I feel especially clear that I belong to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty "" "" "" sixteen Egyptian members "" "" recently got a bill of legislation on "" "" regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by parliament, people and users need to register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law would then be set up in place that is commissioned to enable citizens to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users and users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and recruiting numbers in order to make use of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a donation.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill design, consisting of six Paragliding and made in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video directing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is being enforced when the draft is not accepted, as Egyptian authorities should decide on how Egyptian authorities should decide to register the users and users who are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliamentary and Patrons of the Legislative situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and a password to come through the firewall, the Facebook is blocked. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubted the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt related to what to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they think it is that same as they may control even forceful public and private rooms that could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "if I take them seriously, then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for permission or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to court proceedings." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but it is all possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the concept "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the picture surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Parliamentary Days Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative court against cyber crime, which was envisaged for those who were found guilty for the "public order" and "protest" in protest. "</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards that mishes through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). overall, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to savagery, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, and since they find fewer pounds.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard is the only surviving carniers in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predater exists.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards actually in the free hunting side is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a recording of a large cat at camera, breaks Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shipgawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still busy the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, documented that for northeastern Japan is the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "Dreifach catastrophe" from March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and a atom-accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture of Miyagi was a predominant prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had gone down entire coastal cities by the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Moreover, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived an atomic accident, already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo report from a local point of view, which has been achieved six years after that, to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding regulatory authorities as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement parts (who will be of course, saquai kouy juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi found the biggest success among the three prefectures Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima lives at 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, you are still trying to relocate six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsnee (who will be restling, kasetsu juutaku) to final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the dropping disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in abode.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 percent of the evacuations that have been held after disaster in Behind-accommodation, have been victorious in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, there have been 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by unhappiness, its doors up to December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishery beats in Iwate and Miyagi have been operating again, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery beats up their factory.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">In 93, Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear power zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far again and again, but here Fukushima is far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before unhappiness. Fukushima in contrast can only be found 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half the villagers appeared to make it more difficult to make their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their rebellion has changed in comparison to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of article the Kahoku Shimpo magazine explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local resident citizens have taken care to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents, that still haven't been done enough to disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who were evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has reinforced its attention even to the situation of the evacuate from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the devastating earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, which had to experience the Japan one.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 Evacuation from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were slightly more than 23 000 people, returned to Fukushima, in permanent spare-homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the end of 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated areas are still more than 50 years old. they have failed to compete for Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokio.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilians student at the age of 33 years spent this week in the intensive care centre: last Friday he had taken him a police minister during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a stroke against the head. nationwide took millions of demonstrators in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira studied Silva, the social sciences at the BundesuniversitÃ¤t GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull of deer and multiple fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors made him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial Coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered to be critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">In the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the examination of the incident carried by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he proposes to the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police minister would burst of a protesters and land on the intensification, his face would be six months long on TV and the whole oppression would thus be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel of media activist from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video of Luiz da Luz in the net in which one sees as Mateus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state-state, Internet users have now donated to 10,000 Brazilians (approximately 2,700 Euros) to cover a portion of the costs of the medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experienced a wave of political force: here was the activist Guilelme Irish supported by his father because he joined the Occupy Movement in secondary schools. and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman, who has been attacked by a policeman, who has beaten him with a stroke.</seg>

<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, social and peacekeeping force (PSOL) asked the police via volume control on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street is distorted by focusing on another, unexpected protagonists: a windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo, specifically reported on a broken glass window to render their front pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo is a title story with a bus set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window-disk than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also recognise if one is strictly against any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here also, the term "Vandalism" is an absurd significance, and the typical violence of the military police are clashed through headlines with the title "demonstrators" on the frontonal road with the police. "</seg>

<seg id="627">The Popular Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the Western Cuban Province of Mayoque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no serious sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It has been two years ago when the activities were made in the garbees factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After graduation, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory fell after and after its installations, until only the rumor was left of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">This was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remember exactly that in MaÃ±as I would receive the sugar cane plant, but the promise has not been held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad groundwork had no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stiff of the community looked at a better time.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugars factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the rise-rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos will remain per pound, according to the 2016 report" "" "agricultural" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw export export would provide around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the stagnation of a total of 98 sugar factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane Factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich am 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as soldier, is the closing of the factory, is the word that he repeated most, "cheating."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would still be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">So that the place is received, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first appearance of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed documents that were removed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date differed.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, just the Minister could trike any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibilities and the letters were always more common.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">People from the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do so by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour since 2014 the workshop manager mobile Tonstudios put directly at schools and youth centers in order to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educgen David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks are concerned, such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance or whatever they are found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the wind nebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the kitesurfing first nation in British Columbia relates, for example, the history of Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," which almost two dozen of indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the youths learn the languages of the First Nations not always mutuctory.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation is recorded, the chorus is sung to the Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved had some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip Hop group, who ran them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like anyone would ever care for me</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "but I try to go on earth for my days." ""</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you take our Scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a young</seg>

<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and lead by our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has determined</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see in front of almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are near the entrance shokuestpuru (and of course, the "Plastische models of the courts") of each dish issued, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter or go to the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the making of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokeloter quarter Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes, that of German filmmakers Wim Wenders had documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic meals are usually so ordinary to them not even more striking. a new trend is turning them today in showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with shokul sanu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new with Plasticulously made mobile-ligaments, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned to kitschy-objects, as in this case, cooled cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokua cooling fan magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is increasingly becoming more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) turned into a cell stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile-stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have produced for the exhibition at Tokyo Train Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the compensatory.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone-stands and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say," "" "WOW, cool, now I can provoke my mobile phone with salmon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in Plasticgeries can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone-stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other top plastic meals can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag #, and the effect of the post.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood Kappabashi, dedicated to the Belieferment of the restaurant industry. for example, the shokup sanu for example.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central mexko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and sensorimjournalism I know for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm passing each day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the one I am wiped or sad. it acts as if a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent nor regard this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the perpetrators, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is as if they hurt those who have lost someone and those who fear they had something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories come to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the fact of the human being is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified by 43 students in a neighbourhood called" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they were not spared by such tragedies, if they aren't stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Vier months of compressing in the main town distributions: like a family with threats, it describes how armed criminal month for month money was destroyed by its business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also had had their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back much when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are away from each other the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report in the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for one does not know when they will not escape or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I wondered in these terrible days, if crying, my deep-rooted feelings would solve, but the reply is no, because I have forgotten how to crying. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence signed."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who is taking care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it, in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the kittens that live with him. this is his name for preparing the vial of water, sugar and milk pulses.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant compared to pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy in which the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old one told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years before, when he only saw a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father saw that from armed men had been shot out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder for public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the prosecution issued the office 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand-thousand stories, leaving the organised crime in Mexico and to penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we do not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco," the data journalism project Narcodata launched its goal to present the complex information behind the walled fight against drug dealers, which has tortured the country over the past four decades, in intelligible form.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factcheck is important in a moment when it's about to lift a rumor or forging a forgery.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something the first time has appeared? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since his first publication it was misleading to use tragedies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">2010 crossed a gas carriage to the village of Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, tilt and exploded. about 230 people came about life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, African-largest country had been neglected and thereby devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous pathways of blows, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Grazing fell to the victim of the gas carriage to the victim.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of low bodies that can be mounted on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not related to the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, combatants of the Boko Haram the remote Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye-witnesses reported drastically by atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and stores were burned down and corpse were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been smashed, shot, or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and trying the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo again emerged, as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo is actually one in a series of misstatements; Africa check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was brought to as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring back personal comments like this example, the picture from the DR Congo are related to sources of mass media in relation to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange arose in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by combustion.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by violence against the Rohingya, poise posts as the following on, which complied with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was written by an acidi-Arab news page, which won't claimed the president of Myanmars Tha being, monks and politicians would have taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to use this information.</seg>

<seg id="931">Religion are to be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are zig people who have been unintentional part of bringing the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suges this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowed down the real atrous of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures was already debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it withdrew from images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images and viewers desensitise, and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which studied under forcive media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media, the fact that it is indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist experimentation because with algorithms in order to support the fight against "Fake News". you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat suggested, but what is actually removable from the context or to completely misused way.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (eg. unsurpassable) makes every effort to provide language-inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese suction bar) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all withstand stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were collected quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists include Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist chose "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the relevant language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Notice your parents in recognition of how to have tried in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the convenience or laziness that one feels after having been consolded in cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They sneeders other cultures, revealing other thought-times and wake up our newborn.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this side still want to publish more of this "unremovable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive, these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">It entails me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with it to be Muslim, on different species but somehow we all get into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is in our collective imagination so well constructed that as soon as Muslims, who do not want to fit them there is Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This Narrativ failed to acknowledge that when French, Muslim women are hindered to carry its head towel in public buildings and to cover acid-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported short of a different initiative by Steven Bird, the Unconcilable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written law, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has already been conducted for 2015 events, the risk that small and not so small languages do not be passed on to those born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the world can be avoided if we are cities to accept the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not forget who they are to belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to often associated with it," "" "keep these events instead" "" "the listening to appreciate, to tie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format they tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, they perform their devotion and their presentation to make their listening.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain typical customs of the narrative of the narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nymusara tells the tale of Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explained the importance of his Fabel, John Nymusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide ditch he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were very close to me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling are held in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own histories.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Jartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is known for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives pursued the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he has provided for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, organised in Berlin, devoted to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, a publishing company produced by so-called "Book Sprints's books within three to five days, lashing extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective enquiry) (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is royalty-free, contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build up movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designer, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements of free knowledge, have site to side to look over the fog that surrounds our Newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since the 15th of March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory section of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his liberation, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how bassel pays a high price for its stake in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we have chosen?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we have given up in this process of temporary beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital activist has been in jail since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Antorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the Military Tribunal made of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented itself as an insider-Assad administration and had knowledge of an alleged death component against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and state remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical ologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project, founded in Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Based cultural prototypes prescient as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross straps of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesome traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysrive but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">This project has not yet been able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned how to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other inmates, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without having to actually held a in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a professorship which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She mugs the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, since 2011, the International Human Rights Organisation of Amnesty International has died in custody since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We reiterate our demand today in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption reviewer head after the release of dismissal on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians reacted by anger on a corrupt place, where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence on the workplace of the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by four other defendants in 2010 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza between 2005 and 2008 stood on.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked his re-setting into the company, which happened on 19 April then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor's lawyer made the application, there would be no barriers to Cambaza to resume its old post as the company has no disciplinarity after his custody.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not wish the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, a local institution that advocates public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a relentback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and it is even a relapse in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of this fact that the company should also have a disciplinaract against the contrasting human being.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company has apparently led and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">HarÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, this behavior also reject and considers the case to be "contradictant":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to another sentence, and which half of them had descended.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could give advice and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has advised to become integrated into the firm, which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambian and Student der Political Science in Brazil says, the director besought any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he indoctrinated him I cannot believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to morality and to serve the state * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he has only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambazte used the state as a hand it has an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man is tired of recharged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to recall that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are in the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambiante will remain in memory for the Mosambians, but also as a sharp, catchy, and - next to prophesiastical speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral depictions was, when he was energetic, that "a ambitious human being able to do, even the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>

<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also disapproving:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar Pae," means Kichererbxes or spheres.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information by Facebook users in Myanmar, the well known social network recorded their posts from the net, because they found the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word still is discussed, it is usually used to refer to people with Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or of the issue of October (in Burmese Scripture) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of the rise of radial nationalist movements has given the word an extremely validated connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that usually uses Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today but the word of itself is not retrievoked automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that poets in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in order to be expressed, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with the different meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese as' Kalar htaing 'written what the same letters contains, as well as other words as' Kalar Pae '(age),' Kalar oat '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was erased today because he enthuses the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">But he asked his friends on a witty way if she knew how he could ease his back pain by giving a word of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that it is to reduce the hate speech of radial nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extinguishes all posts to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The degree of automaticism is not understood what you are writing to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, the post must carefully analyze and control it by checking the words below.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar Pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalities who disseminate a love of hate, a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone, spreading the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a Kid and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative writing of the zened word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his Posts, as he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office is removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to reprohibit the Liken, post and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the post office does not entail the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to portray their opinions against the hate-hate.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with a hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poor.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community around advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through their platform but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censored such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they had begun this without any local context or technical support and thus have words as "chair" or "hereditary curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they attempted not to correct the falsely deleted Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which have no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and conceive of curry and an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out if Facebook moves the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their votes and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should be attributable to violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of missile, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring hate speech to his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of being censored the word 'Kalar', it would have better ongoing, more focused on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of the married courts held some members of Hinduistic and Muslim faithful communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not interfere with, since that, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights prevention, that is unrelated, every human being under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married in 15, Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent was, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical Office of the country confirmed that since 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online Petitionen und Social-Media movements that were eager to draw laws to children's toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without doubt they helped to bring this result in.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nonetheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-Guide for B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children's toe, they should be damn't care for their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition designed for tension in this actually complicated matter, and some point came in doubt whether the opposition would disagree with the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the draft law was decided against the children's toe - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree to proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram also posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children's toe was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he has previously been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of the social media users had been enthralled because the laws were changed at last." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who ran a minister in Education Ministry said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has all too much time and unnecessary talk, used to be the core of the matter, but know what? the children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and this is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of opinion was, it took definitely long enough to dismantle the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Hervorian news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spensof law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who hears the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The indigenous Age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious confessions of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the married law was announced today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and there were 35 members of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were opposed to have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children's toe is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childmarriageable.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Maharaj, with the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps, should the law be passed, and he seems to redeem His promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Advocate attorney Paris Al-wi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite right if Maharaj is going against the law, most social-media users, one would approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so general, in a way that only panic and unconsciousness can give us, that the state, our daughters shall protect them from large, hard-minded men who are compared to them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's toe are legal in various gradations, or continues to raise the standard though there are laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1390">On the mirrors of web sites, Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language homepage was issued on 18 January 2012, opposite to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has been the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day become more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful information as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series are fighting against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologists are used to use moving tools for blocking website (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been absent from Wikipedia since 2008, just as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrorpages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator) which does not base itself on the system of domain names, thus making a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost reported IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (via the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything in making snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so, there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if you cannot achieve the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also suggested that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansippeditions, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsides when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigh - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrapi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of one proxy address, a mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia side so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he saw around him never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivate him to wear yourself a camera with himself and try to settle the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar makes every effort to bring Nepalese to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that directs attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as he helps him this first-class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly I called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched it and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was and I immediately began to crashing pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar is seeking cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepalese forces and would like to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he already stood tigers already countenance on face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep at sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Buheks appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) at his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese forces and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to catch at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds, which live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India the women were avoiding with the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men within the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women, that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should be misused to obtain this practice at life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a hypocrite from the Indian state of Odisha and choked by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not common in the name of name, is also common among men. however, they have much less admittances to fear, if at all, they should not come into practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare personnel as well as housewives, a unique club, and were thus quickly became the main challenge of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal who is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working with the help of her video camera at the detection of practices, such as infants up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Ininfected, and guides those clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They told about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they at the same time have made them ambassador for change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, was of women who do not name her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of her husband does not speak according to his husband, is a custom, that they all accept responsibility and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman is respectful of her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is regarded as being deposited, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted, that we never had thought of this discussion until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of Rohini, who had never mentioned her husband, before, at home, try out how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stopped yet long after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on in his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard before. some women believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with a practice in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, it means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she was called her husband's name about their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women should never speak the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise they just pened out, another decided to let the whole motivate frustration against him and his family by curse it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient brace, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was starred, she got fear and said that there was an error.</seg>

<seg id="1512">"" "" "" "a husband to a participant in a less understanding of understanding and the situation in force was less understandable." ""</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports on how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of galvanic red dot on the forehead, which indicates the marriage:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would wear the galvanic red point, if he also worked.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not been complete with them, but they think they are now in a better position, to choose to do it in some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we take a trip on every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to take care of who could hear," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cake for the first time in their life; they dances and speak and spoke about things that they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things, such as our identities in our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things according to them, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted a saline curta to wear a wide shirt over a pants; they have not danced.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice, morality connected to the Saris and much more, muggeled Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided now to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is safe to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed a bit, the Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women profiled a few times, but then listened again to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two do they continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now contributing to each time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feiling for more freedom of movement or the own hanging choice - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that not only is limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese Dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state of state), following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department of the State Department in China has called" "" "an internal matter" "" "and tells a spokesman, he said it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to call up calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, Diving in Liu Xia, to allow it or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have been criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely outdated.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pointer Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met in the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway's Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was in Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government did not mean that this is ultimately nothing to do with deciding.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China since 2010, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had widespread that Liu was seriously suffering, the Nobel committee brought his hope for unconditional release and lude Liu, to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention he was unable to stand up his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife promptly from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top rating of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as she rushed into an Declaration on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China lifts all restrictions of Mr Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1654">The request of the US message moved a furious response from China to itself, with the utterance of the State Department that "no country has the right to intervene and unirresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple:</seg>

<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China asked to provide adequate medical care and to give it the possibility to worry himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP previously that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact us.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to grant its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, true and free of freedom for the exercise of these rights.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo keeps all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact to him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channels of France already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the festive occasions in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who want peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawmakers Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic progression Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to treat yourself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself at a statement on June 28 around Liu and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for which he was strictly punished, had led to a harmonic, stabilizing and wealthy, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be foolish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shangrgam, Singapore was considered to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark also triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting, at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Lawyers, the State of New York remarked the Minister that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because it was compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody questioned about whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and appreciation to create this valuable land, we say that we are not able to be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a must-have.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, eat country then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons that were made by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended a idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he appeared inevitably, undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"" "" "" "however, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party." ""</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the main point of the issue, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers to pretend Democrats, the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given to his American guests were in the last week of Shangrgam, given answers to his American guests in regard to our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarded with non-responses to rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to illustrate his opinion, since it didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a land, but a city is, therefore to which country, belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our good K Shangrgam would take the effort to clear this point, provided that it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing on the blog its comment, he pointed out to the reviews that one should start to read the entire commentary of the conference, so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He studied Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore "be no country," he obviously isn't meant in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam, who acts as the leader of a growing generation, such as a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore was said to be very embarrassed..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew by Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garde, which awaits me - be I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes in it and who is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dissembled the weaknesses of Shangrgams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shangrgam" "" "benign" "" "has committed a mistake" "" "or was it a misleading speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements are of Mr. Shangrgam of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the avala deliver its military service, they defend it only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource class?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Where the magazine Journey of a Decade leads to Bejahung, Singapore was and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have been annoyed many avals...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world being exposed and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most posed to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry I am sorry." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is regarded as polite, interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clear position then the default response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ichockey, Nature." many Canadians maybe cook inwardly before anger, if they are held for Americans, but me disrupting this.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians a Canadian flag seem perfectly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before the invasion of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little Ahornals to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1753">With us there is no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender equality are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are courteous.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies as the tolerant country toward ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would consider me nothing if you would change myself with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>

<seg id="1768">"" "first, called" "" "nice" "", "meaning basically to be ready - just like the good-natured, gentle, but ically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpson "(" "" The Simpson "" ""). "" "</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing, in which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, is inconspicuous and uninteresting to be and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you don't want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a prime minister of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders described as "cute" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence, with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm, open kindness which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone users at Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the District Government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1964">But GÃ²nought to use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they were short after they had replaced the app, messages with a private white chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution paths of terrorists along with" illegal religious "" "" activities and "" "" harmful information "" "" including videos, images, eBooks and documents. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service sector with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, of online frauds, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" government actors or even hackers might be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China generally focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is quite often dark for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1976">That on Twitter-based media outlet "Images from the China" (after the reservation of the boys), the censored news in China published, showed photos from a checkpoint, at the policeman the residents indiscriminate as if they were installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjano ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification slows that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they might be detained for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have compelled people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang are to be found in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are possibly to minimise a response to the instructions of the City Council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office in operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>

<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist video" to identify and destroy. however, this action is violated the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and provides penalties for a whole row of other possible claims, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time indoors; sometimes he conducts on his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is a cigarette between its fingers or its with nicotine cline lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine to flee, in which they lived as rocky (approximately: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is an impassioned activist that faces the conservative majority and scrutinized their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deals with topics like orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all these subjects do not only exist in his hometown Amman Relay, but also in cities that vary from Damascus to the whole to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not exist openly, he sweeps against the US American foreign policy a particular disinclination.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of second generation" - even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think because of my own circumstances" "", "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that because I am a human being" "", "while in water is dissolved into two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is scheduled for Muslims from dawn to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do with a sensing called Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slaughter of hot coffee and the vouchers of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if one casts a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore, it avoids easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during the Ramadan water - in order to land not in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the State Department of Jordanian has canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time already.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts is contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert tabby.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert 'had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world unless an old or authoritarian legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordan people as "progressive supporter of human rights," which continues to stand for a intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply silky rhetoric, but actually a clearly marked crystalline reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs works clearly to the preliminary.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms to glue that he made his vision of the fate of Arab women, who have imagined sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently down-known woman whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, the number of 'Honor' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its climax the number of volunteers in the year 2016; however, it is still emerging that Jordan has not lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women, victims of murder or domestic violence against women who were victims of women or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for breaking control from 1954, women who are exposed to risk-driven violence, "to be held at indefinite time in prison," and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for this, not shy away from themes coming in his country for long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib is arguing that his work is political, but admits that he is his music, which is full of explicit assays on sexuality, freedom and expression, and cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became breeder policy, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Laval al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "lies the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santadi."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get in his words, "that is what one wants" - be faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that little someone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were not censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember later that his comments were torn out of the context, and his opinion has been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nues, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nug that was later to work once on behalf of the caliphes, was openly able to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why is the Jordier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new, that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive votes are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan intelligence service received several former government members and members of the teacher association, with the rationale, they would have critical about the problems found on comments in social media, which are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that is the concert Hdaibs, according to what is the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordan Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan took Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it is Hdaib - consists of slow, printed and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">At the end, foamed hadaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreams of not only dreamed of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be guided through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, extentions and artificial kind. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it has come, Hdaib will continue to resist and therefore resistance to resist.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories on the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory means that the vans, the drums and the dancing is marched over more than a thousand years, in the northeast marched in the northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the emy to put into his knees.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>

<seg id="2182">The article will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write notes to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even much more important, people who feel outside and feel affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went exactly to the two young Colombian activists by the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios by the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios, from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Carta por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), the young people are encouraged to write guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently she was the country of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace pact with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which is the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the subsign of the peace contract as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">A long way before Columbus is still a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare that have lived for many years in illicit camps have been exposed to war rhetoric, and all round the clock having their weapons in themselves, have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, has to accustomed to guerrilla warfare, these are now in their ranks and support them to build a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian began to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did, until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warfare that should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, who took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian, had the opportunity to speak just with Kailash Satyarthi, the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this declared that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Valentine, thousands of love writing, but those forgotten they need much unnecessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he continued to share in this year his love with people who were most urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was written to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life. "these letters will show that the Colombian company is prepared to make the discourse of a war history to a shared history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranco and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would give me "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Authorities of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were wondering how they had done earlier to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support for people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very turbulent moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the policy knowledge student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca describe this unforgettable experience.</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former warriors led me through the camp of the Guerilla Combatants.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I was in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warfare), I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on bed there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said, anyway, and asked," "" "hello, what do they say exactly?" "" "he answered," "" "I response to a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>

<seg id="2214">I impoverished him completely and set me next to the pomegranch.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was too sorry to write all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something else from life than war. the FARC had never imagined, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers to hunger. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>

<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">In the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion together.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state to develop a political party, we can help create the society more righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people to hear that had never heard hearing and no electoral law, and to recognize that people, which I have often seen as a monster and even hate them, even people with beautiful emotions which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>

<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>

<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to rise up arms and protest for their rights, and that is completely justified (...).</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had given everything to get started and started scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyboards in my right wing.</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name drauf; but the doctor did and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office sense, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectfully went with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats over the last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of an alpine trauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They told me, some said to me, I must prove it by passing above without through the roads; others wanted to tread in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that all was only bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tried to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people even spoke to my mother on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay down a strike around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors and saved them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark window discs and a numbering plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time I had happened, it was clear to me that there was something sluggish.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends oversees the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you left?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to show off their name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then happened somewhat imcredible.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without record myself, without ID, without everything.</seg>

<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this emotional barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always, that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually teach me how to watch the person who remembers themselves from their past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who are still alive?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone to eat the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that, during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait and he didn't leave a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most probably they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also still being held inside these secrets / adult men?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relatives, or were dropped from their relatives in order to ask the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are stored there so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say: should they be upset, one will show their bodies on TV and claim them that they would have attacked either village or military support." ""</seg>

<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a muting or do you have a source of this information?</seg>

<seg id="2339">There was then nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there have yet been no reports before. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>

<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The Security Department of the Sharia has never provided me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotto is not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>

<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but mainly on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had smiled and laughed you upon once with Argwohn.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly limmering.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: how do you work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not a lot in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, gatherings, I begleite them to hospital and help them to get Essential notions.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I stumbled away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you own a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is more beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature of this is purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to white you with foam before the mouth, that there are no cords with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have who, the cabbage have, the Russians also have them; on the whole planet there is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>

<seg id="2387">I am here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who walk into the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan: live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many thinking about Transitional men suffering from men who love men and they believe that you are alternated his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a trusion.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact, different lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, I am so happy here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Some people managed to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2408">The Ahvazi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month, some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shai Bani Tamim - have been more tolerant.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where the majority of those living in Iran live in the Arab Awazi movement, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to ride its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arabic Ahwaz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took over power and claimed 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahiwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the locals get only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is denied the Ahuazi Arabs in systematically employment in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of twilight, built water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region through dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youngsters went up to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director-General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of Awazis who finished a job, completed the basic school, 55% an additional school ended and 45% have university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Awazi will entail access to jobs in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihoods outside their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahvazi and to be put on, as even Arab names on the workplace are not tolerated, softer than the speaking of the Arabic language or the traditional Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that enendure the Arab Ahwazi, will propose human rights defenders before the situation is explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all the Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women are still less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it is about what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms will still make sure that women encounter earlier or later in various fields of life on a glass roof, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I will be double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS men, on black trandissidents women, on black women from the Diaspora, or on black women from the Diaspora. if I am talking, on which kind we have been physically, mentally and verbal abused, many white feminists and white intersetional feminists are not to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to uplift their voices and" "" "Kumbaya" "" "to sing my lord" "" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk that in addition to sexualised violence there is a institutionalized form of racial violence, which we are exposed to black women on two-fold nature.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries are less important than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to as a migration background of the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black and women with a migration background, domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin colour, have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as a black woman, to bear in mind the white woman who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-feminist who fought me and countless other black women ever and again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner said 1851 in their speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a vital and marginalised being in the historical respect." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings that also absorb through cultural assimilation of our customs and customs to drive its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to paralyze white women the importance of overhaul of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to stir the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and to refine themselves from the white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release me full and completely healed of feminism, bringing me to the movement of Womanism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so obstinate, that Intersewage is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever that we define black women to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>

(about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves by doing our own way in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersetional feminists are immediately call separatism and marginalisation after they read these lines, please inform yourselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a blurist environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm, due to my dark skin and of my existence.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really misled, says mystic GonzÃ¡lez, researcher at the "Centro de documentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various data and reports, but not even hansing the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In the year 2015 District Apostle 9600 ads went for domestic violence because of domestic violence. at 70% of this it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace wars. here also 86% of the indicators came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of the women they were physically misled, 55% of women spoke of psychic mixing.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenminister in Ana Baiardi will actually be shown a few of these crimes. "on each woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 females, which do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who will be refunded because of physical activity, there are two women who do not do this, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay has not been independent criminal law, the prosecution authorities cannot properly document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists have at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the solid girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't really want it, but then after. this should be repent for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she carried the psychic violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier about it, I always thought that only women are happening to subjection to men because they have deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never ever happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Being called by name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had them isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people reply to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of misuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victim of abuse at least had some complicity to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that does not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner she misled them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo de CREO ("I think you") that consists of women all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Your wealthy partner finally got to persuade them that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads have remained with the authorities without earnings and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing section where the most urgent needs of the continent is addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for your medical research on site and there are two reasons: for a lack of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined far more grave impact than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. warrior speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, are often not well used in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are differently encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you had previously had?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratories is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in the schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">Rw: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students from all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are requirements for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, the health care sector (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa on western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are limited speed, things to do, and gain access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), too, the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com webpage, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Mortons was working only by his own suppress and the question, how many salads can get there are limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more Salads were patented and that he could not use it further on breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents gathers not only for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resilience to diseases, a special red or greentone or uffling leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more such patents have been registered with more and more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still preserves salad, he now needs no longer, since his work is getting more and more protected by more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock brock in order to paddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so now we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go into salads far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they withstand judgment, no one can breed more a new crown, because all the characteristics are already patented, "so good as possible and tries to curate those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful about it and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has joined the movement in addition to moving in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Room Station ISS have red red RÃ¶mersalat of the Sorte OutredLicence in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more so than would the movement come out of the IT range and not the range of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to make sure that some plant species and women are not protected as intellectual property so they are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the Initiative, just Ossi, you can commit themselves to US breeders to use other seeds to use them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" -breeder only allow others who breed their seeds, to breed it, and not immediately strants - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerious professor University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi pre-board, Jack Kloppenburg is to control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as to protect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, workers "rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by continuing seed with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the existence of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer that is offered for example in the markets, should also know that the way that vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "nutrition" "" "without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will commit to others their seed remains free of charge. this helps her approach to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters can argue that the future of food supply is jeopardised because the available genital pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights in plant material, which is thus always reduced, inadequate, shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Board of Ossi, has worked in their doctoral thesis with genetical variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartoons-characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that massaging plants like wheat are patented in even more large style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or their colour improves up to such, due to which they prospers and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder increased by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more unnecessary than ever since the changing conditions of climate change are much inferior to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, monsanto-speaker in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that the intellectual property of other breaches, as" "" "patents and the protection of pesticide innovations" "". "a patent is basically taken a plan which can follow any one as soon as the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "so such protection does not inhibits innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that different: 20 years waiting until a patent christening, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general public and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue using the best and recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton stands on the concept of patenting on the concept: "we did not create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them up themselves and as a breeder we eventually have no clue as the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state as well as Ossi leaders, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "who has cultivated a variety as well as its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures believes in their cultivation of mass herbicide, the bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly insulting. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized businesses (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they manage to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant producers would like: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my sorts in a couple of years ago, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years prior to competition, how to make it quite beautiful in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Though the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, but the concept grows quickly around the world.</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time, it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government was continuing to report the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents violations of human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Fixed - despite this attack and the scoring of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend oneself in this part of the world, have never been so important as it now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are needed to overcome the blockage and not remit. we insist that our task will continue to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, as illustrated by independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post, and that of the Qatar network of Al Jazeera because of the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photographer, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after having been arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exerting physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly related to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blockage through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, to lock blogs are very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfatalism al-Sisi; and even if the blockage of the blog may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to impart to me the feeling of having a siege; an attachment, an tried murder, overhead at the national Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Mutigen walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blockage from vendors, through the circumference of boarding-sur-sur-surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blockage of web pages that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will additionally be wasted that the censors decisions behind closed doors has been taken, whereby the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis on which they can proceed to court against these actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers are reported in quite Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school," "Each second day is a police officers in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe rob Pharmacy with military weapons," President Temer sent 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air breafee to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the action of violence reached in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government organisation Global Justice had even invited the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the publications on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" published on 16 August, "This is not normal" in which she announced a new heading named "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex vomiting, etc. everything, which happens from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio, is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not include our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war resting in a country not recognises war." ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explained that according to the information provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas, that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We realize that a war course, if it is distorted, even so it can be used, atrocities of the police, which really shoots and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not civilians, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name of "war" more than they benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist of CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand to describe violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could not complain to account coordinator responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an occasion in the analysis of military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in staff, education and a historic and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Memory: the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra is owned by the Globo, the largest media company of South America, which stressed, such as CecÃ­lia, has repeated the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policy interventions also belonged to the founding of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in the year 2003, whose aim is to conquer by making a massive police officers a Favela and to raise a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. since a few years, the UPP has led to several reports of rails and repressions against the poor communities who should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux distinguished from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this calls on the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war. to this end the intrusion into the territory of a" "" "enemy" "" "in which a civil is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" "" "collateral threads" "" "and" "" "hidden balls" "".

<seg id="2787">After or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police declared the mountain with the Favela Jacareadeho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence also this incident took headlines: a fruit sailor died as a result of shots, which had led the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn should the boy break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahersoldier had just been killed by the Taliban and many Hazarah felt very vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred on the Hazara-famous Taliban was getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazarah left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Several days after his flight, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coherent environment. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went in Iran. once again he was standing in a foreign country with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself, in order to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees was dominated by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," reminded of Asharf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty house on the jobsite, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we were not frozen at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf took his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous passage along the sea, he suffered shipwreck and strandined on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "" "" "after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum, Acartons 2002 came to Italy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">True, Italy due to relatively high availability quotas is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are pre-finding, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the civil rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "is suffering from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seeker is accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centers" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center if they have officially added a request for asylum - which can be drawn even a month after the registration of the asylum seeker.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then are people who have no money for accommodation, to either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there were also Asharf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irreconcilful livelihoods helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in the construction industry, Asharaf awarded its entire savings in the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snaky bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharf Baratis's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - an Hazarin Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The movie received the Venice City Award in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians, are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the company-operated companies, including cutting-shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu is told by the various afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes, the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals range far beyond the Italian Gastronomy and to the retail trade and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as any other. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf forged plans for opening a factory in Kabul, in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest pegs on the market and improve their financial situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stands for stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf did this journey myself. now he wants to also help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
