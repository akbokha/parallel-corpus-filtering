this is James R@@ isen .
they know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York @-@ Times @-@ Re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA &apos;ve suffered illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes an cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret operation , in which the CIA had literally dra@@ fts into Iran for an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible history .
but do you know , whom the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 10 years the government has been determined against cr@@ isen and urged him to call upon its inn@@ ish sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this move , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , and to defeat journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish the secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media has not received this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen they do .
so when the government at R@@ isen , he did something , which many coura@@ geous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen , with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , happened something extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , despite having been calling for years , that it would be imperative for their case , the demands of the government were dropped upon aw@@ nings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and springs can no longer hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of stopping and re @-@ statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , his telephone calls are secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and financial information , his credit card , and even travel hints with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many instances .
President Obama promised in his approach to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has more condem@@ ns more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government has too much from their work as secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional record , because the government has more and more possibilities to swe@@ ar all .
but just as the technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
that may they be able to contact the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in witness .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed , when rats had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today is from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload or send documents , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server in which the respective message Agency has access .
so the government can not proc@@ ure more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately governments all over the world develop new es@@ pi@@ ous technologies that end@@ anger us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ bur@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to know about ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers and will tell of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague , the alarm is be@@ ating from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ bar @-@ In@@ sider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to exp@@ ose crimes , but to protect our rights of constitutional right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest dat@@ le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers , &quot; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ itness &#91; de &#93; a statement . &#93; this week we were sent by messages on a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in the law firm of Mos@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that a fo@@ e of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad hos@@ tile companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars came to Russia President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting for the next release , and the next unveil@@ ed documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency and a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ Romans .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful ones are capable of hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and it concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness , this disclosure is phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets and bol@@ ster -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems to be very confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always ask myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe &apos; .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers .
it can be very difficult for criminal pro@@ secution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States .
probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who responded in this revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this type of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed the employees of school @-@ district , school children .
it has allowed Bet@@ amm@@ ers , especially an@@ cho@@ p investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global W@@ itness we wanted to find out how all this will look like in practice .
how does this work ?
so we sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ators received themselves as African minister who wanted to bring lost money into the U.S. to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sho@@ cked that all of us were looking forward to an attorney to our investig@@ ators , as he could transfer his money .
these were all occur@@ ren@@ ces . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one has been handed over to anyone telling money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not a matter of a single attorney to submit proposals to our co@@ vert investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single political leaders , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules in order to hin@@ der these kinds of behavior .
this may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful ones .
but as bor@@ rowed optim@@ ism I really see that a lot has begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen prec@@ arious insights into more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is based in central regional regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law draft in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global W@@ itness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind s@@ inner companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campa@@ ign@@ ing to end this kind of in@@ transparent laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally end .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a Red Maz@@ da would be .
one day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip through all the land . afterwards , he would go to the peac@@ em@@ aker .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I did not know him just now ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he does that really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a balloon . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my mind said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ask how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I was star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I build in there ?
a wild bo@@ wel in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I got out of the bed on to@@ en@@ tically at the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view completely .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ?
people sitting on my li@@ lo , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a break , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ading , my room@@ mate attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can make it to transform anxiety into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wondered how we could earn some of it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up so &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollar on the air mattresses on hard@@ wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our cheese flock and mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door came into the castle , rein@@ vigor@@ ated Brian and I met .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent for rent ?
the things came in roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when a visit comes over .
over the Internet , they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them .
this will make the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but she does not .
nobody who is still quite at comfort , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one gets on the things that you can do well . we could dis@@ miss .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to approach objects , but now we wanted to create trust in the design of immense trust , among people who had never met before .
can design make something like something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree can we entr@@ ust you .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your mobile phone in your left seat .
this silent approach from panic , which you can now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS ; they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a stran@@ gers in your hands ?
the majority sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you be able to announce that he is responsible for the president of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had revealed only once with his name : if he had told how he comes , how his dog or his children welcome ?
imagine , you would have 150 assess@@ ments which all say : &quot; he can really put really good mobil@@ es mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence of the trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to put negative opinions .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and home .
little surprising we trust the people most , who like most like us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bi@@ ases .
thrilling will make it happen if you add the call of a person -- in our case through assess@@ ments .
if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good name sti@@ cking com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
moreover , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you will not get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I am doing this with my family holiday . &quot;
how can you create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds upon hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
there are three things one can recognize .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need , which had not been covered before .
for us the business goes straight very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or desol@@ ate homes .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I was engaged in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it does hurt if I just think of it .
the disappointment , which one hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , from the 123 million people had only one fraction , one fraction the only one problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , there may be wonders .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts took him in the hospital .
he even set blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to be heart attack as a heart of heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ en@@ ers that can save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you drive to the hospital in your own car if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer without having the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a question of economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not do justice to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a portion of itself open , and that changes everything .
when you travel now , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but not less authentic .
but what would be if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would be Ans@@ wer to show a thoroughly fill out and to show one in a pub envel@@ ope , of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from scratch ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of the shared share ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in the South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parks that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a bite ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . there were incub@@ ators programs started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest on a stran@@ ger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hosp@@ ital@@ ity@@ also gave it before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has it works ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realize that the right design can be found with the components .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that intrigu@@ ing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da moves on to me .
we naturally know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a belie@@ ver ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , brain@@ washing , a terrorist challenge ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so , the media people present , which look like me .
a study sur@@ rendered that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not have known Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their u@@ ber riders .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ gym ,
and I am a practitioner , spiritual .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose to carry out my head gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends ent@@ ails : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ ati@@ ous was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely opposite to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adjust myself a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only thought passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have been struggling with the Quran .
I read it , I thought , was in question , un@@ question@@ able and believ@@ able .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow commitment that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm makes me sometimes crying .
I call myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever have the feeling that somebody takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ?
it feels that it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering company .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then that was the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you will probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had to end folded , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ let . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in building , people sp@@ ill out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into ou@@ tra@@ der .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I joined the television channel and heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
not only my country have been attacked but in the N@@ u transformed me the works of others by a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the United States of the USA to move into a new city and start building with the building .
I remember -- when we sho@@ cked myself -- so deeply it went to my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; Sei@@ d war@@ y , &quot; remains in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in in@@ doors all the week .
then it became Friday that week -- the day at which Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again I said the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw myself an extensive coverage .
the feelings were , understand@@ ably fil@@ tered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people whom we held for Muslims to be fre@@ ed and attacked .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who attacked this country had attacked our country .
I swe@@ pt out the anger of the people at the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually say people to say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims .
when are we going to do it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the United States .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor one gets as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one only holds under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tur@@ or in the body of the United States , but a li@@ vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , creators and Olympi@@ ad .
will make the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
it may be free to hold some parking , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people other faith toler@@ ant and show greater citizens .
and like me a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the radi@@ alization process , one has detected that it starts online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
lastly , a group like the IS is based their brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as a m@@ ess , as a mother , as a human , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would insert ourselves into their imagination if you recognise them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
but if you thro@@ ws a look at it , it doesn &apos;t drive what they las@@ hing in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which she lets you read these things into the script .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me an amazing history recently :
a girl came to him because she would prefer to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , The problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that her anger , their sense of injustice in the world would bring them only in trouble .
from nothing inspired and something that could have given their fur@@ y sense , it was a primary goal for the instrument@@ alization by extremi@@ sts that gave her a solution .
this Ima@@ m made the link to God and her church again .
instead of embarrass@@ ed them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways to a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she shou@@ ted to join the IS .
it was a glimpse of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of mind ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear that at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : when one has given test messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of the Iraq war , and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
handling with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear vibr@@ ates us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about how to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
de@@ ah was a ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous human being knew she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ast@@ o@@ unded and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is of my bro@@ ther@@ ing such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that had ended in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he enjoyed eight times on de@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the start .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque , or were we safe at home ?
we got it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we op@@ ted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we headed to the mosque , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , belie@@ ver and non @-@ believers who have come , not to att@@ acking us , but to join us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on the number sure ?
or become one of those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with grav@@ ure , therefore one exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not f@@ ool you . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual , as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study to Muslim around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in no respect .
if people seem as an exception to the rule , then the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is just about to become a billion business .
control , monitoring , monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ end access in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air@@ ers in France has built up a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . several years ago it began to fly with rop@@ es .
by inter@@ locking passengers high speed and acceleration in small space .
you can also build self @-@ res@@ ili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to wear loads with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
so that a system works aut@@ on@@ ome , it must be collective , where in the space there are mobile objects .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for the demo@@ s of today we use a new localization of Ver@@ ity Studios , a member of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations to board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be found in the highest lip . for example &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flight @-@ device that tries to strike two fly with a fla@@ p .
as other star@@ ters , it is efficient in ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float floating and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is highly versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of tail@@ star@@ ters is that they react to tur@@ mo@@ il such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms in order to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aer@@ op@@ lane is able to reg@@ ain the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate to the heart of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gather together to hurt you .
decades ago , pil@@ ed pil@@ ots have been able to fly remot@@ ely , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ long ago we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ t@@ inner , the mechanical well @-@ used air @-@ operated plane . it was invented in front of short @-@ time .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hinges and spinal cord , no further actu@@ ator or check@@ ers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , it happens in the inside very much so it can fly stable and can move around in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to really throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it precisely when all watch , is vile ; therefore I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ ds is an exercise in lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the omni@@ direc@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a practice in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
this gives it the infinite capability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction he is rot@@ ated or even as he is rotating .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is un@@ imaginable in models , the rest is learned directly with flying .
let &apos;s see it that way .
if air@@ ers should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate dual @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this is turning on the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance square cop@@ ene .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a cordless -- the machine can continue to fly , even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate that we make a half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ pri@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one disc of bread -- and provided them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit know where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine as an op@@ press@@ way I want to be a busy lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and the act of creativity .
it serves as remembran@@ ce of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive @-@ commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is on the cake .
thank you .
a hundred billion years ago , in a very distant galaxy , two black holes became more and more fast , they walked as the mass of three t@@ uns in a tenth of a t@@ enth@@ esis in pure energy .
this short moment it shines brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy put them in the form of light --
we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time of time and the universe is explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first time in a time .
1,3 billion years ago had just created several zel@@ liges life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauce , people and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group had particularly coura@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to look for a huge laser det@@ ector , to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts sour@@ ced about col@@ li@@ ly black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people realized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work , they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Integrated @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase , resulting in the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 LIG@@ O started to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems for a final review .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colon@@ ized black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is no longer Science @-@ F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tic physi@@ cists about black holes and their through observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a ru@@ ffle in the composition of space and time .
in the wave of wave the space and its entire contents will be stretched in a direction and into the other .
in the illustration of lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretch and compression , stretch and compression . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched to the waves of the waves and over@@ sees the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st floor , one explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ ing of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder , LIG@@ N , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulty in building such det@@ ectors are vast .
but physi@@ cists are nation@@ ally and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
return to LIG@@ N . Scott claims , LIG@@ N is more of an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a w@@ avel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial treatments , the size of your mobil@@ es .
that &apos;s quite handy . because so you can customize an image or a map of things by viewing the light around you by several points .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble t@@ ints have a w@@ avel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean to you especially :
about the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain properties like sound and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now speaking Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob sle@@ w them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ bi@@ ous Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple images of objects in the space .
but by looking at changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LIG@@ N are the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert w@@ avel@@ eng@@ es in shots , we can hear the all literally .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ turning holes , circul@@ ate simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very fast , you hear the same line with an additional sound change . this sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement , illustrated in the w@@ avel@@ ength .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Device &#93; Jem@@ ini , who knows what he has to hear , see this as sound cable with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which revol@@ ve around as quickly as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the sustained significance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ N uses a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never done before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ei@@ che stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon .
we will never go through , since these op@@ ak are .
the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big Bang is covered through his own fl@@ ashing .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and that is probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , that we have never seen before and of which we do not have any idea . things that we can only discover by hearing .
in fact LIG@@ O found immediately in the first attempt things that we did not expect .
my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes bring forth , like LIG@@ O they ob@@ serves , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies resulting from prehistoric times . the black holes are to be shaped by no@@ zzles for our arche@@ ological work .
LIG@@ O makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space , at the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we proce@@ eded from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as coura@@ geous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ N we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I was an experiment .
for one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; to say before I was afraid .
regardless of whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &apos; Yes .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the swing ?
no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I buried my fear .
my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest ones , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all .
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak @-@ terrace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say ever yes -- every single time .
nearly . I am not perfect , but I am worried .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ seed to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think it &apos;s things that awak@@ ens you to life .
dre@@ am@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I Cre@@ ire Television . I producing television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for providing 70 hours to get into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days at four shows , so all nine days 20 Million Dollar television , four broad@@ casts that simultaneously in production , four times : 24 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows run on Thursday morning .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ure . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that are burning around the world .
do you know who that is still doing ?
no @-@ nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I would like to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re talking a company , a country or a budget , to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I don &apos;t just walk around the computer and f@@ anta@@ sies , and it is true if I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dream of a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all the reality , all the blood , everything per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it &apos;s when I set troops up as m@@ old I on a canvas .
so as opposed you have a high tone , ran a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and mat@@ ernal , fi@@ erce and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me if the work is good .
a sums begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the amounts of money sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on her .
many people participate when I give them the amount of money , that I &apos;m writing writing that writing I delight me .
do not understand me wrong , this does it .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I began working and establish , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the tot@@ ality !
the amount of money is more than writing .
money is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the money is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive different from size .
the feeling , not to be different to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ ality .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is said ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it in question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more complicated limitations , the more work there is , the more things simultaneously , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more so I give history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , is not true ?
the country , I create a monkey , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums , the tot@@ als .
I like this money . I love the tot@@ ality .
I need the tot@@ ality . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mother is a single employer .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped .
the sums of the engine was in@@ hibited .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the amount of money did not come back .
my sums was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans job , 15 hours @-@ days , penet@@ rated weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ate , don &apos;t deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , don &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a first @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sums of money and the amount of money I was .
so what makes you do , if that , what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ cr@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid by the author . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you are doing , one painter , a mother knows , a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , one loves to know how to know the sums , if you didn &apos;t know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart sounds , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am sitting on the way out , late , and they say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no more than to become aware of two things :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; kittens . &quot;
it is called anyone else . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I p@@ asse it when I am Titan and my money @-@ coated , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and meet their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the sw@@ ing@@ man , I can do nothing except that .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country , I create a monkey , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id arthritis , delicate voices , wax and the song , in which it &apos;s going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ k@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere , peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short , that I hardly can breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy res@@ eller comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the amount of money is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a sums .
and now I feel like I would have to know a magical mystery .
but let us stay in the cause .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the titanium sum@@ ers , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m filled with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums of money is not strength and it is not work @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums of money is dependent on love .
the amount of money is the current one comes from li@@ ger@@ ent .
the real sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums have ignored the pressure of history , the experience to experience , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums of money is simple and original .
the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , a lot more love .
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice if I want to listen to the sums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play in me not just as easy as working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at work as well at home .
this approach is painful , because what kind of person would rather than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we went around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst so@@ ap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly rigid , absent , and be@@ wil@@ dered .
I always ri@@ pe away to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sums of the universe meet me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped using games ?
you can also say it ! let them always say Yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are probably right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they rus@@ hed to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I was replaced by a Mari@@ enk@@ i or K@@ eks .
and I speak of my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it .
each can get 15 minutes a bit , even on a bad @-@ mood @-@ day !
15 minutes a bit !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids made ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my comfor@@ ting , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about pleasure ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it up .
I am not perfect in it . I sho@@ ok and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands shortly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training I wanted to do more and more .
15 minutes a bit , why not treat full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the amount of money came back in my free time . the amount of money seems to return if I am not working .
working not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . she for@@ wards me to new ideas . I take advantage of it to the full and love my job again .
I like the sums , but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
so@@ ap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful .
it is my trick that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan Poker trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money . the country , I create , the marathon , the ones , the sums , the sums , the sums , the money , the sums , the sums , the money , the sums of life : the sums of life .
the more I feel this f@@ uss , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life @-@ feeling inside me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this amount , the more I know who I am .
I am author@@ ship . I think it &apos;s things I awak@@ ens you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of that job ,
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical treatment .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became working neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional Neuro@@ chir@@ urg ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ ders stimulation . &quot; in this process , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons , so that the neurological function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain@@ s .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to us .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was the leader , and worked in the emergency room every day and night .
often I res@@ sed patients with sk@@ ull deer @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that in the case of sk@@ ull , brain , the brain , and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this one needs to remove a part of clou@@ dy brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen stomach mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
cells of a tissue is growing , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
one has to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish .
it was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts we managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as such a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ an that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can turn into each cell ty@@ p of the organism .
the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they split up slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died .
we therefore saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but were different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
all of us have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large hir@@ k@@ rin@@ se cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why are they left us ?
we do not know that .
we believe it will take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our master cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing allows .
this we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as well as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then select coloured , in order to keep track of them in the brain .
in the last step we r@@ ens them on the recording of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we am@@ pl@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we am@@ pl@@ ate the same cells into a brain tissue .
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with ape .
in the first scenario , we pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched it completely disappeared after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not go there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we saw an injury to and r@@ hy@@ ming exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they knew too mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been r@@ hy@@ ming .
the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells we die in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so , we wear monkeys with a manual design task .
you had to take feed @-@ rates of one tablet .
they did this very well .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we have been in the motor cor@@ tex at the motor @-@ motor @-@ field in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand anymore .
just as it would happen at people , they recover spontane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain@@ ers . you will recover to some degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that reco@@ vering spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from infringement .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we r@@ ack@@ down the cells : the same A@@ ffe , two months after maturity .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them free@@ ze and later .
we can use them in other neurological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ush it with man .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that there are several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials by man .
jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilo@@ gram pap@@ ri@@ ers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to take the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it requires a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is certain , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society .
we tend to regard them as an imm@@ utable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ed with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programme that were realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who would have repeatedly said that Democracy would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to come back with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies , our future are gri@@ ev@@ ous and our great , new technologies will be wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this subject , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ Parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and know him as the debt level , which casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt level ,
but few recognize his toes .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ ted austerity and affiliated corporations , which might be anxi@@ ous to invest it there where it would be productive and in@@ comes to wear the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the euro zone , 3.@@ 4 tri@@ lli@@ on dollars is investing in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , streets , gin , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars does like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars , which at the same time are ho@@ vered in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely does not have anything except to f@@ ade the stock market and supply the property prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive funds form the twin @-@ ins , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is st@@ agn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which could not invest in an end@@ lessly loop of the investors in which they could not invest . exactly as o@@ edi@@ pus father , who would be afraid of losing the prophecy of the Iraqi people if he will kill him if he will grow .
un@@ washed the circumstances lead , which lead to it that o@@ edi@@ pus him kill him .
this is my hairy with capitalism --
his very special kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form , in which the open air and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed naturally too many --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ t the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these incl@@ usions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the athy of democracy was and is that they gave the working @-@ working poor and not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial that they gave them the right to policy determination with same mo@@ ods in matters of state vessels .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was not held long --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly expanded .
however , our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established over the politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two rather , the economy is gradually changing politics and ex@@ al@@ ted them .
are you wondering why the politicians are not the same as before ?
it is not in a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because it is possible to be in the government today and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics is dro@@ w@@ anders into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
when you think about it , it is about as such as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has so sustain@@ ably nour@@ ished the animals , of which she nour@@ ished , that she died at the end therefore .
it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far fet@@ ched by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods increases , the overall economic demand and the managing directors of corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their business .
the more successful of capitalism exp@@ anders the &quot; demo@@ s , &quot; the higher the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour @-@ power and the well @-@ being of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re @-@ bring the policy and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just like in the antique Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left has had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t surprising .
the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it , by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ om through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the tw@@ ins will be higher , the wast@@ ing of the wear , and social conflicts deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re @-@ create the economy and re @-@ re@@ unite the economy and politics and pay attention to the re@@ unified area of democracy , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he will survive , --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a D@@ yst@@ one , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or is similar to the human being in &quot; star Tre@@ k , &quot; in the machines to serve the human being , or put into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ er@@ scopy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all brief , some examples call .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a job to next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then , all income derived from capital and from income and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and employees working there , which the firm has not heard . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no eph@@ ric tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investments are .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and the economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which she privileged people pre@@ fers , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ an@@ esi@@ an@@ isch , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ isch .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a genuine democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ one sink ?
the answer depends on how we politically decide together .
it is in our hands and we are doing it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... do not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
when this analysis is accurate , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
likewise as Hay@@ ek , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely wir@@ es .
BG : in fact , and now we are at ease too .
Y@@ V : if you do not see it , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the view of the West in China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to policy , while the area where most of the economy is playing -- the area of economy -- is a democratic free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say pro@@ voc@@ ative to this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is now similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- - remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was very skep@@ tical about what the democratic development concerns .
what can be observed in China now , resembles that development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , cried violent to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many li@@ sten@@ ers are curious to your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I used that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the euro a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say , from the compl@@ ac@@ ency of the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continuous denial that a massive rein@@ for@@ tification line ran through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first suggestion was that this denial was revealed .
it is true . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to be the denial .
yet you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain a economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one will perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future , if we do not change its design .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any Minister that has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the finan@@ ci@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they merely wanted to bring our government too , just because they did not want to deal with the off@@ ences that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not confess that they have been an cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ in@@ al GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika credi@@ tors involving us this policy has imposed , and one : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all of this , and despite the progressive th@@ on of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if she does not survive , the un@@ connected tile forces will be demon@@ ic and the European Union are destroyed .
this will not be dis@@ astrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we fail to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
Roy Price never heard that most before , although he probably will be responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for much of you .
this goes back to the decision to met Roy ago three years ago .
Roy Price is leader at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ o and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy did a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard dealing with industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are at the right on this corner .
this curve is the distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b site . the rating comes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after you look at a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care to get on the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ wear &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; .
he makes up more thoughts about the middle yields , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon so doing something , so Roy Price does not risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he does not need any guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch any free of charge .
and if Amazon exists for free things , you have to turn right ?
millions of spectators take a look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
you are being observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything .
you capture when you start the show when you are cur@@ v@@ ated , which parts you jump over or once again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
in fact , they accum@@ ulate the data , process this and this is the answer and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four re@@ public@@ s US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that many people can &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House celebrates on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analytics . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have watched the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they show the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors are the actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x thus has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happens here ?
one has two very short peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because its logic somehow dis@@ ar@@ isen , that in all things should work .
if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years in statistics of back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
the min@@ des@@ te , what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we move more and more to statistics , to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
will anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
nobody . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and ask for mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . that &apos;s not that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of these companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google is sometimes making mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can be predicted by data analysis of the flu , the bad way , can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data out@@ performed companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand something sometimes .
despite all these errors , data significantly affect the decisions of life -- on the work place , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions , like the decision for cancer treatment
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
must you ever solve a complex problem , do you mainly work two things :
as a raise , you put this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a d@@ wide place the items you put together again to summar@@ ize a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to de@@ comp@@ ose a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to con@@ front the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
when there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to collapse again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to put a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first they have we@@ ather@@ ed by TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when we start control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ques or no question you need to shake only the ball to get an answer . &apos; highly likely , -- exactly right here at this moment .
I will later fight it with a technology demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the after@@ ward .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic rate .
the ball is more rug@@ ged and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions whenever we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very heart@@ ening message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off , decisions to be made , an expert in what you do is doing and risk .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn .
thanks beautiful .
