<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York-Times-Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA've suffered illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes an catastrophic US secret operation, in which the CIA had literally drafts into Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, whom the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "almost 10 years the government has been determined against crisen and urged him to call upon its innish sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistle-blowers, and to defeat journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish the secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media has not received this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen, he did something, which many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen, with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, happened something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, despite having been calling for years, that it would be imperative for their case, the demands of the government were dropped upon awnings." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can no longer hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of stopping and re-statements, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his agreement, his telephone calls are secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and financial information, his credit card, and even travel hints with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many instances.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised in his approach to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has more condemns more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government has too much from their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional record, because the government has more and more possibilities to swear all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">That may they be able to contact the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet existed, when rats had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet of Aaron Swartz, and today is from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload or send documents, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server in which the respective message Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can not procure more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments all over the world develop new espious technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to us to ensure that not only technology-burner like Edward Snowden have a way to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abuses in the care of soldiers and will tell of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague, the alarm is beating from Flint. or a Wallbar-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our rights of constitutional right." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest datleck of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers," [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness [de] a statement.] this week we were sent by messages on a Leck of 11 million documents in the law firm of Mosseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a foe of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad hostile companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars came to Russia President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting for the next release, and the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agency and a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful ones are capable of hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And it concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, this disclosure is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets and bolster -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems to be very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always ask myself like a Matrjoschkapuppe '.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who responded in this revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the US has allowed the employees of school-district, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed Betammers, especially anchop investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this will look like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigators into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigators received themselves as African minister who wanted to bring lost money into the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">We were shocked that all of us were looking forward to an attorney to our investigators, as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all occurrences. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one has been handed over to anyone telling money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a matter of a single attorney to submit proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single political leaders, wrapped up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules in order to hinder these kinds of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimism I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen precarious insights into more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is based in central regional registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law draft in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind sinner companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy to get up and say:" "" "intransparent is not good for the business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campaigning to end this kind of intransparent laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a Red Mazda would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip through all the land. afterwards, he would go to the peacemaker.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep today? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I did not know him just now! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he does that really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have a balloon. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my mind said:" "" "Ask how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I was staring at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I build in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild bowel in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got out of the bed on toentically at the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People sitting on my lilo, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a break, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleading, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can make it to transform anxiety into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wondered how we could earn some of it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and set up so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollar on the air mattresses on hardwood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese flock and melet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door came into the castle, reinvigorated Brian and I met.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent for rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when a visit comes over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will make the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she does not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still quite at comfort, would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one gets on the things that you can do well. we could dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to approach objects, but now we wanted to create trust in the design of immense trust, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree can we entrust you.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your mobile phone in your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach from panic, which you can now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS; they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a strangers in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you be able to announce that he is responsible for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had revealed only once with his name: if he had told how he comes, how his dog or his children welcome?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments which all say: "he can really put really good mobiles mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to put negative opinions.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are related to age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who like most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling will make it happen if you add the call of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good name sticking commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, such as "Hi!" you will not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells a lot, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I am doing this with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds upon hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three things one can recognize.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need, which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business goes straight very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or desolate homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I was engaged in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it does hurt if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million people had only one fraction, one fraction the only one problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, there may be wonders.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts took him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even set blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travellers who tend to be heart attack as a heart of heart attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real proteners that can save lives, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive to the hospital in your own car if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without having the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "rent" "" "we do not do justice to it." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a portion of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel now, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but not less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would be Answer to show a thoroughly fill out and to show one in a pub envelope, of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of the shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parks that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a bite,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. there were incubators programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest on a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitalityalso gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realize that the right design can be found with the components.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that intriguing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda moves on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we could use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a believer?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, brainwashing, a terrorist challenge?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media people present, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study surrendered that 80% of the reporting of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not have known Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-gym,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practitioner, spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose to carry out my head gear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends entails:" "" "why oppressed you yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusatious was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely opposite to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adjust myself a perfect and unachievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only thought passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been struggling with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, I thought, was in question, unquestionable and believable.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow commitment that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm makes me sometimes crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I call myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever have the feeling that somebody takes you, you fully understand, and yet somehow love?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels that it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering company.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that was the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you will probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had to end folded, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eillet."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in building, people spill out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into outrader.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my god.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country have been attacked but in the Nu transformed me the works of others by a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the United States of the USA to move into a new city and start building with the building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- when we shocked myself -- so deeply it went to my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard, I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said, "be vigilant," Seid wary, "remains in well illuminated areas," "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in indoors all the week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday that week -- the day at which Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again I said the warnings:" "" "do not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a target." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw myself an extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were, understandably filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people whom we held for Muslims to be freed and attacked.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandanstops on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I swept out the anger of the people at the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually say people to say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going to do it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor one gets as a whole and a benign tumor one only holds under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no turor in the body of the United States, but a livital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, creators and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be free to hold some parking, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view people other faith tolerant and show greater citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me a head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radialization process, one has detected that it starts online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family, that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor, or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Lastly, a group like the IS is based their brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a mess, as a mother, as a human, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would insert ourselves into their imagination if you recognise them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "sacred book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throws a look at it, it doesn't drive what they lashing in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which she lets you read these things into the script.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me an amazing history recently:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would prefer to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, The problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that her anger, their sense of injustice in the world would bring them only in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing inspired and something that could have given their fury sense, it was a primary goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that gave her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the link to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of embarrassed them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways to a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she shouted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: when one has given test messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they are more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims came to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraq war, and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermining the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Handling with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear vibrates us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not just about how to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous human being knew she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astounded and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is of my brothering such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that had ended in the afternoon when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He enjoyed eight times on deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque, or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We got it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we headed to the mosque, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out of my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believer and non-believers who have come, not to attacking us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on the number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become one of those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have taken a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding an TEDTalk, a thinker with gravure, therefore one exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not fool you. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study to Muslim around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want wealth for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in no respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem as an exception to the rule, then the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for crafting, is just about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, monitoring, monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug. possible, this is made in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-end access in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of airers in France has built up a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. several years ago it began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By interlocking passengers high speed and acceleration in small space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonome, it must be collective, where in the space there are mobile objects.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the demos of today we use a new localization of Verity Studios, a member of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, computations to board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be found in the highest lip. for example" start "" "" and "" "" land "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight-device that tries to strike two fly with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other starters, it is efficient in ward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float floating and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is highly versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailstarters is that they react to turmoil such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms in order to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aeroplane is able to regain the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, piled pilots have been able to fly remotely, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong ago we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the montinner, the mechanical well-used air-operated plane. it was invented in front of short-time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and spinal cord, no further actuator or checkers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, it happens in the inside very much so it can fly stable and can move around in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to really throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it precisely when all watch, is vile; therefore I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monds is an exercise in loneliness, this machine is here, the omnidirecter with its eight propellers, a practice in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">This gives it the infinite capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction he is rotated or even as he is rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is unimaginable in models, the rest is learned directly with flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it that way.</seg>
<seg id="451">If airers should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate dual-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is turning on the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance square copene.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a cordless -- the machine can continue to fly, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-pricopter -- every single weighs less than one disc of bread -- and provided them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit know where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine as an oppressway I want to be a busy lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the act of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as remembrance of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive-commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake is on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">A hundred billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes became more and more fast, they walked as the mass of three tuns in a tenth of a tenthesis in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment it shines brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time of time and the universe is exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time in a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago had just created several zelliges life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauce, people and -- God stand up to us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group had particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to look for a huge laser detector, to look for gravitational shafts sourced about collily black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work, they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer- Integrated-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase, resulting in the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO started to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems for a final review.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colonized black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I had worked is no longer Science-Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretic physicists about black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a ruffle in the composition of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">In the wave of wave the space and its entire contents will be stretched in a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the illustration of lecturers in courses on the relativity-theory often a really alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and compression, stretch and compression."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched to the waves of the waves and oversees the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st floor, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousanding of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder, LIGN, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulty in building such detectors are vast.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are nationally and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to LIGN. Scott claims, LIGN is more of an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial treatments, the size of your mobiles.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite handy. because so you can customize an image or a map of things by viewing the light around you by several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tints have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean to you especially:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like sound and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now speaking Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob slew them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dubious Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple images of objects in the space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGN are the measured frequencies in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wavelenges in shots, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-turning holes, circulate simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, you hear the same line with an additional sound change. this sounds like that: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, illustrated in the wavelength.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to the following: [Surrendes Device] Jemini, who knows what he has to hear, see this as sound cable with each 30-fold sun mass, which revolve around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the sustained significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGN uses a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never done before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why maseiche stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur however at the core, which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">The gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is covered through his own flashing.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, that we have never seen before and of which we do not have any idea. things that we can only discover by hearing.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found immediately in the first attempt things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes bring forth, like LIGO they observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies resulting from prehistoric times. the black holes are to be shaped by nozzles for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us a completely different point of view of the events in space, at the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we proceeded from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGN we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I was an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say to all "Yes!" to say before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say 'Yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I buried my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest ones, calls for inexplicable reasons all.</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-terrace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say ever yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Nearly. I am not perfect, but I am worried.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side-effect: only recently, I actually understood that the "yes" -seed to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think it's things that awakens you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire Television. I producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for providing 70 hours to get into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days at four shows, so all nine days 20 Million Dollar television, four broadcasts that simultaneously in production, four times: 24 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows run on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendure. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No-nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you're talking a company, a country or a budget, to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I don't just walk around the computer and fantasies, and it is true if I say: I understand that it's not dream of a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all the reality, all the blood, everything perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I set troops up as mold I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as opposed you have a high tone, ran a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and maternal, fierce and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the amounts of money sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate when I give them the amount of money, that I'm writing writing that writing I delight me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I began working and establish, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the totality!</seg>
<seg id="618">The amount of money is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Money is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totality.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is said ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more complicated limitations, the more work there is, the more things simultaneously, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more so I give history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, is not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, I create a monkey, the marathon, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this money. I love the totality.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totality. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was inhibited.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The amount of money did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans job, 15 hours-days, penetrated weekends, no remorate, don't delegate, a Titan sleeps, don't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a first-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums of money and the amount of money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you do, if that, what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "hypocrl" "" "stupid by the author." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you are doing, one painter, a mother knows, a painters, Bill Gates, one loves to know how to know the sums, if you didn't know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart sounds, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" poses me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am sitting on the way out, late, and they say," "" "Mama," "" "you are playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no more than to become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">It is called anyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I passe it when I am Titan and my money-coated, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama," "" "you are playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and meet their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the swingman, I can do nothing except that.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, I create a monkey, the marathon, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid arthritis, delicate voices, wax and the song, in which it's going to release, or whatever the girl in "Die Eiskgin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere, peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short, that I hardly can breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy reseller comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The amount of money is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would have to know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay in the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium sumers, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I'm filled with broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "the sums of money is not strength and it is not work-specific." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums of money is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The amount of money is the current one comes from ligerent.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums have ignored the pressure of history, the experience to experience, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums of money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to God the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can rid myself as a workaholic from any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice if I want to listen to the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play in me not just as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work as well at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This approach is painful, because what kind of person would rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We went around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly rigid, absent, and bewildered.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ripe away to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe meet me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped using games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say Yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are probably right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they rushed to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I was replaced by a Marienki or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak of my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can get 15 minutes a bit, even on a bad-mood-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids made ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my comforting, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I shook and I siege. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands shortly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training I wanted to do more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit, why not treat full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The amount of money came back in my free time. the amount of money seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. she forwards me to new ideas. I take advantage of it to the full and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my trick that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan Poker trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the money. the country, I create, the marathon, the ones, the sums, the sums, the sums, the money, the sums, the sums, the money, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this fuss, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new life-feeling inside me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this amount, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am authorship. I think it's things I awakens you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of that job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became working neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurochirurg?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "Tiefenders stimulation." in this process, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons, so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and heavy pains.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to us.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was the leader, and worked in the emergency room every day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I ressed patients with skull deer-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in the case of skull, brain, the brain, and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to diminish the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this one needs to remove a part of cloudy brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen stomach mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue is growing, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One has to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">It was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts we managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as such a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from the biologian that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell typ of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split up slowly and after a couple of weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but were different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">All of us have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large hirkrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe it will take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our master cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing allows.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as well as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then select coloured, in order to keep track of them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we rens them on the recording of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we amplate these cells into normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we amplate the same cells into a brain tissue.</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with ape.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we plagued the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched it completely disappeared after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not go there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we saw an injury to and rhyming exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they knew too mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been rhyming.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells we die in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we wear monkeys with a manual design task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed-rates of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did this very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we have been in the motor cortex at the motor-motor-field in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at people, they recover spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brainers. you will recover to some degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from infringement.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we rackdown the cells: the same Affe, two months after maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neurological models, for example at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implush it with man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that there are several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who may need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials by man.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilogram papriers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to take the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It requires a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really suggest that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to regard them as an immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwinded with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programme that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would have repeatedly said that Democracy would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to come back with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies, our future are grievous and our great, new technologies will be wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On this subject, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twins" "" "twin-Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and know him as the debt level, which casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the debt level,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his toes.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the verted austerity and affiliated corporations, which might be anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and incomes to wear the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the euro zone, 3.4 trillion dollars is investing in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office building, schools, streets, gin, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars does like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time are hovered in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely does not have anything except to fade the stock market and supply the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive funds form the twin-ins, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which could not invest in an endlessly loop of the investors in which they could not invest. exactly as oedipus father, who would be afraid of losing the prophecy of the Iraqi people if he will kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwashed the circumstances lead, which lead to it that oedipus him kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very special kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form, in which the open air and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to mint the significance of the athenic democracy due to these inclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athy of democracy was and is that they gave the working-working poor and not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial that they gave them the right to policy determination with same moods in matters of state vessels.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy was not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly expanded.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established over the politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two rather, the economy is gradually changing politics and exalted them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are not the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it is possible to be in the government today and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics is drowanders into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">When you think about it, it is about as such as a flock of carnivores, which has so sustainably nourished the animals, of which she nourished, that she died at the end therefore.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that the policy has so far fetched by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods increases, the overall economic demand and the managing directors of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their business.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism expanders the "demos," the higher the twins summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour-power and the well-being of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if that is true, it is obvious that we have to re-bring the policy and the economy and it would be better if the" demos "control" "", "just like in the antique Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left has had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't surprising.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, by replacing Niedrigloom through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twins will be higher, the wasting of the wear, and social conflicts deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to re-create the economy and re-reunite the economy and politics and pay attention to the reunified area of democracy, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that leaves the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he will survive, --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a Dystone, similar to the "matrix," or is similar to the human being in "star Trek," in the machines to serve the human being, or put into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like Dysterscopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in all brief, some examples call.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a job to next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all income derived from capital and from income and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and employees working there, which the firm has not heard. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no ephric twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 biggest emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it" "" "Cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "Cosmos" "" "and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investments are.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberated, in which she privileged people prefers, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and keyanesianisch, globally keynesianisch.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystone sink?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we politically decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we are doing it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... do not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">When this analysis is accurate, Marx is absolutely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely wires.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are at ease too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not see it, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to policy, while the area where most of the economy is playing -- the area of economy -- is a democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say provocative to this provocative, China is now similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- - remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very skeptical about what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now, resembles that development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, cried violent to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious to your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I used that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the euro a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say, from the complacency of the complacency and the continuous denial that a massive reinfortification line ran through the eurozone and continues to massively threatens the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first suggestion was that this denial was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is true. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to be the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">Yet you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one will perhaps delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its design.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any Minister that has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the financiers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government too, just because they did not want to deal with the offences that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not confess that they have been an catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika creditors involving us this policy has imposed, and one:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all of this, and despite the progressive thon of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if she does not survive, the unconnected tile forces will be demonic and the European Union are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we fail to strike the path of a postmodern 1930, after which it appears, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price never heard that most before, although he probably will be responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for much of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to met Roy ago three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leader at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfro and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy did a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard dealing with industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are at the right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb site. the rating comes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows, like" "" "Breaking Bad" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows, the addictive, where, after you look at a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care to get on the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to underwear "Toddlers and Tiaras".</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes up more thoughts about the middle yields, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon so doing something, so Roy Price does not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He does not need any guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch any free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists for free things, you have to turn right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators take a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are being observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you are curvated, which parts you jump over or once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they accumulate the data, process this and this is the answer and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republics US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House," "" "but it seems that many people can't remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House celebrates on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analytics. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have watched the available data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they show the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors are the actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom on four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix thus has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "House of Cards" "" "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happens here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very short petitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because its logic somehow disarisen, that in all things should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years in statistics of back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we move more and more to statistics, to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Will anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and ask for missal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. that's not that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of these companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google is sometimes making mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can be predicted by data analysis of the flu, the bad way, can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data outperformed companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstand something sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data significantly affect the decisions of life -- on the work place, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, like the decision for cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Must you ever solve a complex problem, do you mainly work two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a raise, you put this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a dwide place the items you put together again to summarize a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to decompose a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to confront the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to collapse again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to put a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts again, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first they have weathered by TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when we start control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaques or no question you need to shake only the ball to get an answer. 'highly likely, -- exactly right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later fight it with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic rate.</seg>
<seg id="1135">The ball is more rugged and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions whenever we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very heartening message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off, decisions to be made, an expert in what you do is doing and risk.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
