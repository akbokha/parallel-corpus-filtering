Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should come across .
a pit chapel where the tunnel is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ day reasons for farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everybody who had already exciting , because the car Nav@@ i took place a green meadow , instead of a circum@@ vent road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of the State government , everything else is current - yet very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area @-@ area of Mün@@ chner Mer@@ cury had changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas that one does not recognise as such .
in the large clear@@ er map , for cities and communities , all @-@ called maps , so @-@ called origin@@ als .
this originated in accordance with the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable Auth@@ orities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and has been presented to the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader took part in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II war .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ o@@ graphic recording of Bavaria at commissioned - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbors that the idea of an area @-@ covered Bavaria map was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV was ahead of the project ahead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable Auth@@ orities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the presentation of the city of Munich comes from 18@@ 56 and is like all others to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling , which emerges in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district .
today there is a s@@ late in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ str@@ aps are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where now the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when hin@@ j@@ oma appears a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ crafted items from the so @-@ called &quot; urine , &quot; which was derived from the property tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small pitches do not occupy there today no farmers - but small ten@@ derness in the complex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Carnival of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century indeed still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the case of the new district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen has not only read the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the auction road there are once people with ins@@ inu@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den , the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for the accus@@ ation of the so @-@ called mis@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged himself for an exhibition of the institution .
for 280 patients had first been place , later was expanded to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular anstalt in hair of 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich is located since 2006 , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
at the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt there are young people in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the medal t@@ war@@ y the building in 1920 and turned him into a teen@@ ager with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - built in architectural approach to the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ Platz was marked around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Pur@@ ch@@ erst@@ raße was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought about the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
one big remained to the present day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once standing at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are working on and on 5th April 2017 the sp@@ ade @-@ bite for the second S @-@ Bahn platform is carried out .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich card can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the Promotion of colored has issued a warning for color people that discri@@ min@@ ates due to discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the federal state Mis@@ souri , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , requires A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to take care of the state , as a number of frag@@ mentary , cash @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces in recent times throughout the state , and here it will be noted , &quot; said in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law by Mis@@ souri , which makes it more difficult to win discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ately on minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injury of civil rights that men happen .
they are held for their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a state in the United States .
the group inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist decay against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more during the journey and taken by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report of the office of the general state @-@ country @-@ old from Mis@@ souri , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than women .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ souri . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring conflict , or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri came out at the end of 2015 in the year 2015 , after the latest numbers from the hate @-@ hate review programme of F@@ BI , representing the state with respect to the number of such injuries at the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult to cl@@ ash a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) Travel warn of Texas and Arizona , had issued the local law enforcement authorities to susp@@ end people because of immigration violations , resulting in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U for further stream@@ lined pro@@ filing .
travel orders are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times interested parties have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ hal@@ o@@ project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ de@@ mar@@ n project is a success project and continues next year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ ant@@ or@@ ate Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
at the court yard of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann the representatives of the fishing bacher CD@@ U @-@ village association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann first gives an insight into its operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and also many young animals and housed in five apartments resort guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing journey for the milk of his cows , so swing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the resort guests only come Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also called B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of fishing bach , he rejected the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not be profitable to such a steep areas .
the green space for a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and run this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he does not lead to bio@@ production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; female &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor .
farmers have often been in criticism because of the promotion
more than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 with total 25 plots from eleven participants .
the conservation area is 40 hectares , which cannot be en@@ forced until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 Euros , the half of the leader was funded , a quarter carried the municipality of fishing .
therefore , to f@@ ade the farmer 12 6@@ 10 Euro , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres to Wei@@ de@@ ity .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ wives there is not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipality of Land@@ s@@ lin@@ ie ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state Promotion of Wei@@ de@@ cel@@ esti@@ ck .
the goal is to open the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
a prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ named Förder@@ isse .
in addition , the alleged surface area may not be par @-@ pper@@ y ( lifting about 35 per cent ) , and must be threatened with the for@@ estation .
for the fishing bacher Weimar Project 2018 , the application is currently running eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the operating surface corresponds to 35 hectares , which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking off the Statue of Liberty .
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N beyond the proposals made by the President on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Mill@@ er does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have om@@ itted him if he had done it .
but he laid hold of their significance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta des@@ per@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty ... an icon of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is fac@@ tu@@ ally right , but as he himself formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / your pressed masses , who are longing for , free to breathe , / the el@@ ding waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ der waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Mill@@ er committed not to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they did a high @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a shared classical appearance .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change from right wings to a long time .
the great scre@@ enshot of the Rush Lem@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one to check , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives , who bring the American flame into the um@@ ber@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something razor .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was there to see her as they had from the exhaustive but hop@@ ed people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people that seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp will ever recognize .
her tor@@ ch should not illumin@@ ate the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the Team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two car@@ rots on the team of Great Britain .
the service direc@@ ting of the athle@@ tics unit of the UK , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Cup team can make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to find it until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and think that something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ cont@@ enders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which are compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m track while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew for team cap@@ tion .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
her captain speech was amazing , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were ch@@ ot@@ y or wherever they live or exercise , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh was totally natural , was great . &quot;
the Com@@ monwealth of Silver medal , who is competing with their fifth World Championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British crew .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in the past year Mu@@ ir st@@ acks has resulted in five British and two European res@@ ins last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs at 1,500 m is another Scot@@ sman , which one should consider winning the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle remember her first World Championships as the only other gr@@ otto in the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the cre@@ ws capitals say that they are &quot; enormous &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not belong only to the team , but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing to be part of the team is that it was elected by the other members of the Team , so it was a great honor to know , but to know that my team @-@ mate have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ dium .
what my speech affects as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put this home @-@ in support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not take you a public ministry if you cannot tolerate the native of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans played George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers ro@@ uted him because of all , from internal politics to his political principles .
he sho@@ ok at the cri@@ tique , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech may be taken away - and , stupid and dull we will take care of the sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ go@@ ose employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and er@@ ased that vo@@ iced their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties compl@@ ained that this week at the beginning of this week .
the St@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a re@@ public@@ ally Gover@@ nor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second largest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of principles .
he was also very glad to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate its hairy head after chemotherapy on his site .
therefore the block@@ ade of those who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum , which is officially designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax currency - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ go@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the governor and argued that block@@ ade of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or br@@ asser@@ ted people , which fluctu@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post was speaking with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeal to Ho@@ go@@ tho@@ lic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate @-@ hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes position on the same subject , it is considered to be so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective commitment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the workers of the Gover@@ nor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or a negative comment will be deleted .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical view@@ points and to temp@@ t or bring demonstr@@ ators and to silence .
but this is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public be@@ amer that is critici@@ zed for it by Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is lam@@ ents from Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County awarded the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) was also given a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the moment of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous po@@ ach@@ o@@ graphs ro@@ uted to his lead .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous trou@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who called pseud@@ onyms as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ unci@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mis@@ ti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Great Britain , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for comfort during the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who ran at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left to the En@@ dr@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is bound up against Paul E@@ ales and acts as a tournament ambass@@ ador to the name of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said raff@@ ia .
&quot; players will see this course from its best , it is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous con@@ fession of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels particularly , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it last year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the action at home .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how this has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pneum@@ onia through passive smoking
in the past two decades less people have died because of passive smoking at lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists of the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in one study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5@@ lung cancer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deg@@ ree Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he approaches his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there were still 400 lung cancer @-@ cases for passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;

in the area of the house incl@@ usions the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the sub@@ strate may be under@@ estimated , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which is repeatedly ham@@ per@@ ed back to construction , poses a big problem for the crew of the firm St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already huge , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gol@@ land
when Bar@@ dina we cook the dinner , she does not use a stove .
they even use only rarely a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cage in the ind@@ eli@@ ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is normally called a sweet potato - locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the tu@@ ber@@ ed tro@@ ol@@ le is performed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ ra@@ zz@@ led hands and sle@@ eves .
De@@ an sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture - where she also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with clouds of water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as the Lat@@ eral .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned to her no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ ing to walk around 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 according to a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ der should vote against the occupation forces .
an existing movement committed to independence against the Dutch domination rapidly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta organised in control of the region and excl@@ u@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , an independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea , which embr@@ aced the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura after Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo stems , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that have been converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown notes .
only very few Indonesian people have made their trip here , blessed because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wearing this clothes , &quot; says De@@ an and pointed to her lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker Hem@@ d and her bright rock .
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ze Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has set the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
Pap@@ ua also has wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
this wealth is , however , a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensures that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military is retained a sti@@ ck@@ ling presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port loads local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ al demands after greater autonomy are threatening these golden go@@ ose and become mer@@ c@@ ly treated .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 papers were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ uas &apos;s headquarters in the 1970 @-@ year years have been genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
only in the region rests the Indonesian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ legal statements and torture - rape and power stops are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week &apos;s happened , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws are reinforced , since Pap@@ uas resources can bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian but demo@@ graphic development is changing as Muslim economies of the pop@@ ulous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell @-@ rat Hu@@ hn and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ us sauce .
local people are struggling to keep in part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables to the traditional market cheaper than local pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to work in the Provin@@ cial Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mom @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popular in the Volk@@ sm@@ ite and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign 2014 to tackle the inequalities and violations of infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann was 27 out of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua a little changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts have broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ u@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs to a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers onto a motorcycle by the dark .
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impetus to their tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , were hunting and smote the group with their tissues , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers moved to the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to be@@ aten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building was set to fire the nearby Government Commission and escal@@ ate things next day .
about 1.000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military commander @-@ centre in order to demand justice .
they have broken hunting hun@@ ts and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle ongoing and a bird @-@ sal@@ ari@@ ed - from Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to s@@ mu@@ red rocks on police and military gather@@ ings .
when the mood has been heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; when the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called for the amount to return home .
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned , suddenly I was shot into my lin@@ kes hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful tree @-@ old wooden building .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who was folded , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting was .
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to be sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian , only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kiss@@ ed him . &quot;
the che@@ ating spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters , that his officers only wanted to save their station , &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner of Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
the news on the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he has expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ amp the historical mis@@ ses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
safety minister Wir@@ anto was said in October 2016 , that he accepted an extra@@ judicial mechanism for con@@ sign@@ ment of historical human rights violations .
but the phrases began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have been occurring a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that have to go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the ac@@ anto made a withdrawal when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he did not plan any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anto , which the UN has called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said more than 1.000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had made these asser@@ tions with gri@@ mm@@ ated unbeliev@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I have afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai will be afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; says he .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the dro@@ w@@ ned , when he conf@@ essed in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
refresh@@ ed vill@@ agers prot@@ esting in front of the local office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were hi@@ ring stones at officers , which re@@ acted by killing warnings .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and a witness , as has been delivered quickly here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to call on the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a stran@@ ger for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal ur@@ fs Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the pap@@ ua by b@@ ying the spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duction of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , in recent years , thousands of people were arrested in custody and invol@@ untary under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safeguarding the national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some emerge never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is just as out range .
the people here build everything they eat : above all emergency and fruits and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women working with four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a are only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since opening new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually directed at the better educated and prosper@@ ous immigrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions of the coverage international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and basi@@ lica Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported due to in@@ appropriate coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission of the film was given .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to lift the restrictions of reporting to transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new haz@@ ards to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia on the most peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ uas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March there are six paci@@ f@@ fishes - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ines and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically viewed the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian State of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the pro@@ aches of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence on human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , visited him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has 2019 for another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a peasant army , is living in arm@@ our educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , like other Pap@@ ua , will consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need any money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ or@@ us fought a last symbolic act of the d@@ ope : the body of a sacrifice was buried on a complex exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us in perfect head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper in Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest urban@@ iz@@ ations of the world in Dubai on its passage and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps inside only two years through the flood , which is actually called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injury have not been reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are standing by fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ 5 : GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed .
the government said they work in providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can ask questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of skyscrapers in the whole world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages on the cl@@ adding , the outside cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in June , at which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Court of tennis ( IT@@ F ) is represented with its big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup proposal made for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single can only be supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ third @-@ majority .
the most often very long , but also very appreciated Five @-@ Set @-@ classics are thus preserved to the tradition of the tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ar@@ ty , which is therefore only almost lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ g@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the analysis .
not only in the vote was after many in@@ consistency before the proposal came to carry the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 we are relatively minor details : so the fin@@ alists will in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup next year will be the host right in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements will be facilitated at training courses etc . and the players will have to complete no official media dates prior to the Davis Cup less official media dates .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bringing robots to a plane , finding a survey
a survey conducted by passengers sur@@ rendered that more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously made objects to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration passed over , including at least 6 percent , which wor@@ e the airplane , while they acci@@ dentally deleted kni@@ ves , or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed to have asser@@ ted them , they would have discovered that they have traveled er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ o , or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - the Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os jet char@@ ters Inc . , was also fixed that younger travellers look more on the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the assur@@ ances that they did not know@@ ingly have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common items that were canc@@ eled on T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to inqu@@ ire objects with blades by the safety control worn , while 2.@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male in@@ quired also confirmed that they had pl@@ ain@@ tly denied drugs in the airplane .
the company said it was asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware had brought about by the airport security and how many it would have been inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people who s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - do not know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - through security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company however points out that the T@@ SA directives are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain , which liquids can bring them or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity delivered by the T@@ SA of conf@@ is@@ cated items are forbidden .
a while , the people , the T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ subscri@@ bers
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k are welcome with the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ signed that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ en figures on sales growth and even more huge sales aim , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has been betra@@ yed for the first time a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k was often applied with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .
now , Sp@@ y Mus@@ k has been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 already once again .
critics were repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
when cancellation is paid Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ ,000 of such a non @-@ binding reservation is suggested , the mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la manager does not believe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth target is not in demand but on the production site .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
2018 we shall have all models together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , we are currently coming for a day of 1800 reservations .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered at the earliest , in the second half of the year 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum exposure .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater delays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company may not hin@@ ders the satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .

&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announce that he will be hes@@ it@@ ating for a year in order to give more time to his authority , to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or to inter@@ fere economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ ut@@ or O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was the long time a reliable enemy @-@ related environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ de has repeatedly been repeated to block regulations or delay on which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have to res@@ ist .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal back for the withdrawal of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a German profession in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas enterprises for the monitoring and reduction of meth@@ anol .
in a on @-@ Wednesday night &apos;s statement , P@@ ru@@ it struck , that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the States through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards of ampli@@ fiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier vulner@@ abilities , the EPA has often denied the deadlines for implementing and then have been charged to define by activists groups and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for performing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ endants the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation of judicial procedures and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , the opinion of EPA , that P@@ ru@@ de will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and any other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress supp@@ oses an vast@@ ly re@@ classification of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month has been approved , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
the New York &apos;s general secretary , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who lam@@ in@@ ates the coalition of the States , who lam@@ ents the EPA in that week , said the group intend to uph@@ old the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the more than 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by smo@@ g that p@@ ours in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rhodes , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the Columbia District .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined spots , chemical facilities and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight react .
the standing smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and every year thousands of premature death cases contribute .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ sion surprising course change .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this rational step by the responsible for the protection of air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to adapt to environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee Church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16th July at 4.@@ 30 pm at a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of the tumor to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini underlined : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ ous small od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg &apos;s jungle first : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z , &quot; the mountain with that of the parish church in Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the study , on the tum@@ our mountain apart from the one @-@ thir@@ sty church , was also a glorious court , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right belonged , and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt , from 18@@ 58 , was right next to the sub@@ mer@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the great settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 conver@@ ge these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was created from the early medieval Church law .
a Lord who built a church , and occupied with a pastor , continued to per@@ secu@@ te the church of this church and could for@@ ge this peculi@@ ar Church as well .
related to this was the right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two zer@@ z@@ est at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in 1942 later during the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the window discs were en@@ rolled and the bells are stolen .
the roof was in@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and ch@@ icks and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ ught in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken .
only the church tower lets you stand .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 , a storm turned the storm ra@@ ges and the half rus@@ hed .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned .
only the present tower today still remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ rau@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; Schaff@@ ner pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as an organis@@ er , our friends and sponsors invite tum@@ our on Sunday , 16th July , to sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel .
designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium ( Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
local officer Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann has been talking about the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is available from 15 : 30 p.m .
for the king of the Seren@@ ade , there is a cir@@ trunk from the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; represent the organis@@ er the fantastic view .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dri@@ est weather .
the organizer hope to many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ings .
the friends and sponsors tum@@ our feel particularly committed to home care , such as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini reiter@@ ates .
association aims to test permission of wind@@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim does not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim blows himself &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) encouraged to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone however means a exclusion of wind use for the rest area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Vier@@ sen had given a second wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a few days earlier - but which had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf because of a fall@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the lack of planning @-@ legal pre@@ condition , the warran@@ ted permission is still illegal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ to @-@ date : the City Council joined the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; it is still a permit of the District government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ viewer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place the issuing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the Circle Vier@@ sen for last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to re@@ consider the matter once more .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing procedures at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , building four each 200 meters high wind@@ wheels .
already last year , the company had been involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen was involved , sealed contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - that is equivalent to one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was four@@ teenth city council entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ush together : woman dies in terrible accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident has arrived on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between low @-@ Wal@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn ) .
a woman was fatal .
two further people were easily in@@ ju@@ red .
the provincial road has been closed over hours .
according to police authorities , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young lady from Bor@@ ni@@ ch was driving in her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year old mother as the accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bathroom Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ars and people from the region are supposed to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the city administration wish to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to attract the local inhabitants into the city center .
as the chairman of the commercial business , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; weekend should raise the customers for this , which offers its own city apart from the usual Super@@ market commodity .
the market is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their educational locations .
moreover , the shops of the city are to invite you to the &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at shop . &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only to residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation : commerci@@ als in radio , a internet video and printed bag that point on the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König .
city management and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with all business@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers to Saturday and the reference to parking fee on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to become new or closed again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many local people could have lost the city center with a view of shopping .
at the end everybody would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and Ver@@ na .
he got to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that had made some extent , had said the king in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centre in Müh@@ l@@ hausen distributed to participate in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
besides bathroom Langen@@ sal@@ za this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ da .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should advertise &apos; for the appreciation of local trade and put it stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the a@@ erial execution of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen could influence themselves with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several re@@ com@@ ers after explosion at US school
during construction , it came to a gas supply in the school building .
new further people were in@@ ju@@ red .
when gas runs in the U.S. city Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine further wounded , some of them were heavy .
according to the fire@@ men , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a hur@@ t@@ ful in critical state .
a man died as being part of a school building at the explosion .
a first missing was later also dead to be bor@@ rowed .
for the dead it was a question of the school .
as an un@@ fortun@@ ates , the authorities suspected work on a gas line .
at the moment there were only a few people in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued after crossed trans@@ cription by phone calls Mexico to pressure due to the payment of the Grenz@@ enlos
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leader of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp asked in a phone at the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to to publicly tell that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the U.S. President dro@@ p@@ ated him because he den@@ oun@@ ced the wall publicly . he said he said to him , &quot; You can not tell the press . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ alo@@ or , Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trans@@ cription of his first appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ au that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , to take over &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; and &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and that the continu@@ ance on the trade that was given by the Obama Obama was proposed to look at him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist mo@@ ist act as a call for justice once more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and rested on the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined ri@@ bs to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a man aged man in a pin strip - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked forward by the wind@@ shield .
outdoors watches the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ker the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him from the car ! &quot;
scar@@ es the silence , when a young black man was distor@@ ted from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a reflection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if then a loop was thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; silent almost all in the audience very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Club Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly indisp@@ utable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of the post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old congress of the state of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and constitutes an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want pro@@ secution , we want ending , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff is a du@@ vet about the corp@@ se of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI acts , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were susp@@ ects in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody has ever been indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects has been on un@@ interrupted for decades , May@@ ur@@ ler that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice ruling the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , to dis@@ miss its voice in the summer .
at approximately at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ id Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supp@@ osedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the ru@@ mor was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she carried , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins in Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when she then moved from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b moved the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who made the Mor@@ ath prepared and arranged , &quot; closes it from a F@@ BI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy between state and local law enforcement who was involved not only on the murder , proo@@ fs and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a voting right @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen . &quot;
almost a decade ago C@@ ass@@ andra has led the annual up@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is des@@ crip@@ tive , grasp and is justified in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America no longer exists .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will face all confronted with the fact that we will face all of us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen women and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lu@@ sty as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ es for years , but he said , the role will never make easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not that way , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to preserve this story in life because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and de@@ pressed him , fur@@ ious , that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n -- he , wast@@ ing of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona shi@@ pers the fire .
there is a rest .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ atting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ t@@ ying one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness .
everyone is busy to get this right not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four sol@@ dered people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with post@@ ure .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there is cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman with a mour@@ ning dress , stands for the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads tri@@ lli@@ on holidays mour@@ ning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks down in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ at swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost divided between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come just down the road .
they experienced all almost eight hours of Georgian moisture as Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to that point the Mor@@ t@@ d@@ ote have stopped , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ ts took place , the air feels spec@@ tr@@ ated .
when the final notes of the song exp@@ ired , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ects the corp@@ ses .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he would like to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w re@@ fr@@ amed Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the turn , who has played the or@@ ist member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ aret two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms together , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is ok , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that that is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience will put together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta was prompted by the follow @-@ up with a black pair which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words what feelings left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; what this really does with me leaves me to believe that the Lyn@@ x still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police shooting was called . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks farm keeps on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he has already begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ position is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have to end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever studied his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in Furn@@ iture , once a week I found here in Gre@@ ven in the Furn@@ iture Bridge .
and I worked on the school already in open whol@@ eness .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does it come ?
amount : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I have known for me that it is the wrong to me and I want to make something different to work with people .
and then I asked what you make .
take a social year since there is an insight , there one can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social education in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , I am probably doing a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not something unusual , during the volunteer service to have several different areas of application ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it will probably always come to where you can be FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care care .
for me that was exactly the right thing , which has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really walks .
different than in building engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has another people &apos;s head , each other has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been r@@ acked up out of the family - one always has to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is .

EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits .
the American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , repe@@ ating that the states are committed to hos@@ tile emissions caused to smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the Agency because of the step @-@ by @-@ step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so called &quot; O@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to work together with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remind us that we will respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ de had announced the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone regulations which should be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ants in order to define where inc@@ isions need to be made to delay strictly speaking aviation standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , passed on Tuesday K@@ ush and said that the endeavor was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental provisions , which has imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the back of democr@@ ats and nature reserves which worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can strengthen the atoms . &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
community wants communal space
in the end the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the council of flu@@ x Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a Community space in the future sen@@ iors .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the even missing piece is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden presents .
while the church community is still going to be , until so far the church community is own@@ ing space in the common ownership , but there is now no planning event for the project that we can expect from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ulate project anymore .
for this there is a discussion on a common Area .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , he would have a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal law float above , such a common area not as a meeting point of view only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ative residence , but openly in the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ pes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past autumn , the decision is decided by providing funding for the current budget already in the past autumn , through funding options .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common space would be so reported T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent beneficial .
the resolution is to signal the investor to signal that in this regard you don &apos;t want to throw a k@@ not@@ ch between the legs , the establishment that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which decreases on the environmental protection - as well as pin@@ ewood - which makes the height @-@ height possible and the construction of economic makes - possible .
need@@ less , so does not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this promise .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he will happen to the body .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so good , for this they rest now in common space from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ an absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it doesn &apos;t see a covered sub@@ invention in any case , or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the area one does not give any allow@@ ance , but get a real , in a doubt @-@ inclusive counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speaking .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , proposed resolutions accordingly , there are three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , in two counter@@ parts the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hike in the resin of star to star
in the Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; will be created .
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information process of many har@@ sh@@ ers , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he uni@@ fies nature , science , movement and sports performance .
the members want to catch the planned route along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase through 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by internet .
therefore in the site is a good mobile network @-@ reception a role .
also Acces@@ sibility is a criterion .
later the Star@@ pf@@ ad train will be enlarged by train .
&quot; on the Star trail , the spect@@ ator learns a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of each stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger lights than another , although he is much farther away .
this constellation will also be convey@@ ed , in which constellation will be an selected star and when he is best to see .
since 2014 the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest nearby astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z ranks according to the information given by the Federal Minister for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye clearly .
in the university city since 2003 , there has been a little simil@@ arity like the Plan@@ etary Mills - the Plan@@ etary Gui@@ delines - the Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ ches ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets , including the d@@ warf @-@ based Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 mm diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away from the sun below 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is a good four kilometers .
while the light of sun is needed up to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour up to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
ped@@ estri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ Star but would last even a half year .

&quot; I am a former au@@ spices , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;

four De@@ als to tire for tire
for an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously in@@ ju@@ red during the Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 is shortly before the connector , and probably after a tyre seat , he probably lost control of his vehicle .
the passenger turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he pit@@ ched himself and then lying on the roof of the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded in the accident .
during the first supply of the wounded through the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction of North for approximately one hour , afterwards the traffic could be b@@ umped on the left lane of the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ unds after the 2 : 2 to the end of the season to Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings .
the first season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result also , since not the two oppos@@ ers would have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the def@@ ences from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle should be further optimized as well .
and a gate after a bu@@ b would not want to catch up the For@@ tun@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better to cope with his experiences in preparation with the tr@@ ash than with the qu@@ artet .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer of Fried@@ mann Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are just in the three @-@ piece positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build good . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; a prerequisite is , but , that we are even better harmon@@ ised and we do not afford as much demo@@ lition . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann is also running after au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if one cannot speak for a mis@@ leading start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can go on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk of a decent season open@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about it , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start of the season evalu@@ ates first after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ mann Funk@@ el , who does not wish to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the match of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of a we@@ ather@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh as they would have no serious and complete play like Fortuna against a ascension as there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of the Fortuna .
while the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy Favor@@ it on Sunday to the encounter in the last ( almost ) the manufacture of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are witness@@ ing them , just because we have the claim to come under the first sixth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games thoroughly positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you must hit by pre @-@ launch , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss .
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arro@@ gant and ugly . &quot;
and so radi@@ el to do his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests published
recent findings of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( council taking medic@@ als ) has started performing the tests last year .
they are meant to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the jud@@ ging of the age , after the Swedish migration ( migration background ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ der@@ ous .
until today , migration has been sent to test cases 6.@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person &quot; may possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steadily over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person assessed as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the under@@ bes@@ ought person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results examined , she concluded that in 243 cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teachings and MRT recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we can not say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to estimate a child as an adult is un@@ correct .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .

in April the work began simultaneously on all three sanitary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is provided for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is confident that the schedule will follow .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made from concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from rot@@ em Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now preserved a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called brid@@ ge@@ appe .
this is a mar@@ g@@ fix that is also used as a path of operation .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meters wide fr@@ appe can be used on Friday .
on this then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way was going to go .
the special thing about it is that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge folders .
particular finger@@ sp@@ itz@@ en@@ ation has re@@ plac@@ ements of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre op@@ tic , connected to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work .
also at first need fish and cr@@ abs need to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ building and the anth@@ ra@@ de towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the Bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Manager , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully suspended .
the cost of the three brid@@ les are at speeds of 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ gan@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it &apos;s not so often suggested that parties go on a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties in the K@@ rei@@ ving volcano coun@@ cill@@ or parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shown on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ gan@@ ce in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle del invites to the loud poster &quot; big electoral campaign . &quot;
and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top opening of the Par@@ liam@@ entary election on September 24th , and the dep@@ uty president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D collectors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally there was the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking space below the Ron@@ d@@ ell - and directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people come here together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ l potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have be@@ aten a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it demonstrates presence primarily at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D really come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ o volcan@@ ic acids , he tried to get such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner had in demand first in Dau@@ n , but there was also a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , several speakers , including the rh@@ einf@@ land @-@ Palat@@ inate , A@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the room there are about 200 li@@ sten@@ ers who are waiting for the top @-@ can@@ did@@ atin for the Bundest@@ ags Sel@@ ection , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty president of the Beat@@ rix which gave stor@@ k their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
somewhat more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is already shortly after 9 pm .
the police can with@@ stand - no special inci@@ dents .

a re @-@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; on Black Forest , &quot; or just &quot; Bal@@ can@@ es &quot; applies to a classical German training with roots in the brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international competitions and have ba@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European cutting edge .
such is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist des SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both uni@@ fies the lust , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders , &quot; world music &quot; un@@ ites himself together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ ra@@ gers N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and free playing to a fascinating overall artwork .
this core part of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring with slight success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for both musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her particular acousti@@ cs will be deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was once in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is coming as a neighbour ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the ří@@ za stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately fell bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with everyone I purchased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave us that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed that du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been be@@ wil@@ dered or disabled .
I just liked it , not seriously being taken . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them have they according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time when they prefer to dress like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has me very hurt .
when I was eleven told me the kids , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
now , look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to tell her love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some call me a little anti @-@ anch@@ or@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday nights with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice has not approved the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he possesses carbon min@@ ors in five States and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee made an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Party changes from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democr@@ ati@@ cal party that would rather stop us to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , ein@@ clu@@ e message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ ges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to an intelligence sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be included in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the ex@@ portation was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the intelligence .
he said it &apos;s sorry for &quot; all athletes , those with competitions , gold and silver medals were carved away . &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress held for the maintenance of the ban adopted in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ doping - Agency ( W@@ ada ) regarding state intelligence doping in Russia had found .
&quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF , President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are at the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still need to fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
Dro@@ g@@ ests were still inadequate and Forbidden trainers are still free , said he re@@ por@@ ters in London for a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .
dream P@@ act for in Mali Sp@@ ashed soldiers
at a wedding ceremony in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought on a helicopter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
yet another un@@ resolved crash , said Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) .
she signed the two conver@@ ters , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her professional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we incl@@ ined to this highest sacrifice , which they achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ at de@@ er@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday before a week in West African Mali .
their si@@ ties were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
on noon first took only the relatives of the church f@@ arewell .
then the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
amongst these were Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ der of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
Trau@@ det@@ ox laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
before the church per@@ sec@@ uted F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense at Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ er@@ pillar t@@ mann has built the air @-@ operation of the mar@@ tial screw tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger @-@ pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur des Reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then it could not have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed prime minister of the Le@@ yen not quite dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not grant any statements .
prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried in his death beside his wife .
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditional is the Danish Royal Palace in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor B@@ j@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already delivered a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ g for the two .
the Queen may agree with the decision of their man , it was further in the communication .
where prince Hen@@ rik are buried , be not yet unclear .
but he did not intend to join the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ ens in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he reti@@ res into the retirement and also places the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and function he wanted to do , he don &apos;t see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , called B@@ alle@@ by , the boss , the boss of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting @-@ night of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will end , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to join the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had come to London in 1965 .
he worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .
in his later woman the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always flew , prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ reign with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I prefer wine rather than beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ ry instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and which in Germany had the reputation to be the brand @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wishes to be a rapid change
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen
precip@@ it@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is following the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising res@@ ign@@ ation of a Green @-@ Members from its agricultural fraction in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) had been thrown into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the pre @-@ Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its succ@@ inct A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ west constru@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in its constitu@@ ency district in Rot@@ enburg ( desert ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ president B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to her .
so I had CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was the other way round .
the new country &apos;s tag will be elected on 14 January of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government must now decide if it could be further ruling in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil does however , however , is indispensable for essential that the land of land will rapidly expand its self @-@ solution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday for further action .
the state of the country also sees the possibility that the sign of the country pres@@ cho@@ oses the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options have to be legally controlled &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will have to discuss all questions if they are legally un@@ reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something cur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press was stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it drew himself as an app@@ endi@@ x in black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the parliamentary members on the return of their land @-@ day members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course , of course , that they have received their country side , giving them over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the local chairman of Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fraction of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have decided not to lead no debate in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there was no differences of content , we cannot retro@@ fit this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the superi@@ ority of the Palestinian Gre@@ ens Members of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal in red green , &quot; the President of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , to restart the country &apos;s day .
the discharge of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen the majority .
the policy leader &quot; in their final van@@ ity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen makes this dirty in@@ gen@@ y and tries to hit political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ president B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to El@@ ke T@@ west into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west in front of , with personal career interpre@@ ters the result of the Land@@ tag 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy .
the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD strongest strength , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a moderate @-@ thin majority of one voice in the country &apos;s day .
agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ ters , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about si@@ gh eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the Red@@ ac@@ Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to look exactly the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the egg @-@ batch production .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ ers from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been placed immediately , and since announcement of Germany &apos;s involvement in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are retri@@ ev@@ able for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just the same way as producers to worry that the sold @-@ sold products are power@@ fully harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if with eggs of the pay@@ load of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not to blame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production @-@ enterprises and consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are sitting in the same boat ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the level of knowledge , the manufacturing sector meets no immediate guilt .
rather , they must count on the basis of mut@@ itable illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is too little Contro@@ l@@ ure in the harvest .
is it possible only at the staff or at the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent education of such action and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secution in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made many times a number of times that I expect a seamless education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ mis@@ m in food @-@ sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer rights and consumers have the right to provide exclusively safe and reduced food .
if a lack of insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumer rights are rightly ou@@ tra@@ geous .
due to the counter@@ f@@ eit means , manufacturers , traders and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels it has to be consistent and high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is spe@@ edi@@ ly and feeding un@@ resolved .
how to control the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent in@@ verse issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Cup transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will still come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by UEF@@ A , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer cre@@ ws from access to the most prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by UEF@@ A 2011 , mean that PS@@ G would have to point at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to France .
PS@@ G can make sure you do the money , so N@@ ey@@ mar dis@@ writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of the glorious reign of Qatar .
associations may opt for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but they must ste@@ er with legitimate entries , which allow them to enable the Bre@@ ak Par@@ des@@ iring point in their way to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel S@@ ini after his election as UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had given enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and cr@@ acked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the crew and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three @-@ year subscription period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million Euros .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ mer@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will further strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a 5 @-@ year contract , allowing the solution to be paid for the next five years to the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G was granted a € 60@@ million dollar ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the cre@@ ws are required for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 to 21 players who otherwise remains normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which could try to exceed their financial reviews by drawing their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while an Catalan enterprise could be the PS@@ G @-@ spon@@ ge if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was applied by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar has been made to make payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup @-@ Ambassador will be easy to find out of such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive every attempt to observe the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ ellers .
the association will assume that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was definitely mist@@ aken to see one of the best football fans , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial intelligence &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of the latter ownership of PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which is financed by an association .
&quot; it is a consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football during the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new og@@ ist supplier
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now the s@@ alute is standing in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the job new .
Swiss @-@ speaking at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a relevant report by the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
in accordance with current planning , the airline will start a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would consider every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very happy , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small red d@@ ow@@ ders up to 14 grams a year distribute the flight ladder from the landing at the passengers per year .
at the cost of the cost , Swiss does not intend to provide any information .
industry tur@@ mo@@ wers value the order volume according to &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1,5 up to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more importantly it is the gi@@ ver @-@ effect : for a det@@ og@@ ist manufacturer it is a prestige order .
how many Candi@@ dates are concerned with the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an end to the contract by the Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards are distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the option to place the logo , Swiss res@@ ign@@ ing two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
on long @-@ track trips , customers of the First Class with treats are pampered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumping mat , in Business Class Nas@@ rid passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ au and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally an o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( it enth@@ uses an original story for speaking D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H.

by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle aged men play children who are inv@@ ent - they still managed to win the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the wine .
&quot; ten years &apos; , with his adults , who are now playing adults is less emotional @-@ rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the found@@ ry , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand of the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand , which is the cradle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , we have a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ car@@ et@@ aker ) , now Roman @-@ author , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ icious P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ es ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ made impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the Ex@@ courses are the best part of the franchise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ pavi@@ lions of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cru@@ x .
it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could present this Franchise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reached what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty years , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang to visit the premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ fight I@@ con@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on the Mit@@ ylene tomorrow , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart many objects were per@@ sec@@ uted , as the pro@@ secution issued the Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 alleg@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 and were issued arrest warran@@ t against these .
in addition , the officials created some marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
at the same time swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
the action took part in the Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators .
in total , more than 300 police officers was in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia is organized drugs , heavy violence , tried murder , as well as Rau@@ b and black@@ mailing .
already since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secution of Con@@ stance on the organised drug stores in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort on the Mit@@ ylene tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the spot@@ light of the investigations especially Italian national with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia .
even if a incident took place on May 27th in Hü@@ fingen as early as early in the morning , several shots were fired in a restaurant , likely to go to the bank account of the gang .
how do large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not arise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report according to the foreig@@ ner Register in Germany has significant short@@ comings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ decisions among asylum procedures .
the Federal Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen respects , has drawn attention to a media report according to major gaps in the country &apos;s Central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies in the there registered data could lead to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned us in an analysis that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , there are reported ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about EUR 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are expected to be managed by approximately 600 local authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer arise in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entries can substantially slow back @-@ back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does it continue to follow the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics about emig@@ rants people are not covered by EU citizens , which at all would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false arrangements led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on the handling of emig@@ rants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said therefore in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government apparently has begun to re@@ send refugees to Italy under 16 @-@ year children once they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BAM@@ F lead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first .
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the entrance capacity for families with min@@ ors in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy obtained guarantees for inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) keep these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would return to refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner political speaker at the Bundestag , U@@ lla jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , thre@@ aten in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;
second best result achieved

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is laid out for it and we call for the spi@@ der respect that their blood for stran@@ gers is still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ min@@ ed mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood @-@ end helps more people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circuits of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are distor@@ ted into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could already benefit three people from a blood@@ shed .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions that are performed in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ circular team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher participants a few years ago .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation , spec@@ ulations have been sub@@ du@@ ed over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in that month , because the weak economic growth has s@@ led support for an increase .
in its quarterly report report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on household income would continue , although inflation is expected to rise in the autumn by almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years they would be necessary to ch@@ asti@@ se the inflation led by Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Recovery package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time for finance plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks , although it is said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after deciding on interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain weak , as the pressure on the real income will continue to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it repe@@ ats that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ utation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets predi@@ ct the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however the Bank stressed that Enh@@ anc@@ ements would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the projected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared to the projected 1.9 % and 1,@@ 7 % compared to the projected growth forecasts .
it has maintained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after those messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ stri@@ pping growth rate increases the rising expectations of a sub@@ portfolio and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
growth is expected to be in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % although it is easy to recover after the end of the year .
the most recent In@@ fl@@ ess Report provides little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and minor sal@@ ari@@ ons , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is getting worse before it gets better off .
she added that monetary policy in the next few years fails to prevent the income in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast can be extended considerably .
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , resulting in the weakness of pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of the lower consumption .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote , which has caused the sink of the volume .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
before the final judgment of the Bank at the interest rates , the call was increased after an assessment , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ made households , whereby three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and they will again be drawn again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to its objective of 2 % be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ aller &apos;s Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in the light of the shortest revers@@ ing of s@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking very strong to shops and want to finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those who are running the existing de@@ br@@ aries and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should bol@@ ted the HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
patients will be received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ approved proph@@ yla@@ xis use ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risks at high risk risks by around 86 percent , now by the healthcare service provided by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he ple@@ aded to finance the trial after the Appe@@ al Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .
the chess section announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) .
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enter the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be launched in the UK in April 2018 .
prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV @-@ transmission in infection diseases .
Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicine in the body of a person are available to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken any day or so already two hours before intercourse .
amongst those who come to question for the treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known through anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a doctor &apos;s doctor , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medications in that week after international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by examining clinical trials , how it is used in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to meet the needs and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to improve many , many lives .
we cordially welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one , who has no risk to HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now as the Pr@@ EP test has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is to be welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ated implementation by the government .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ learning infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to help people to become HIV infected , and that it will contribute to ending the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life exists : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold their bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square miles has been completely rebuilt .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end they gave the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for yod@@ elling .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on each other , so the architec@@ ton@@ ical challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were st@@ acked over each other without having to bu@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms at full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
sp@@ icy gold furniture , sil@@ ly acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
mir@@ rors plays a part in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all cut@@ edge and glasses of yo@@ z@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the intensified , frigh@@ tened M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; it is important , so if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne offers additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the base size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you fell not in the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment itself can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ers. of a slightly astonishing into something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave them not .
brothers fight for over 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his rejuven@@ ated brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation on separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since then the family 1973 bought a store at Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew in a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the town centre , the development centers of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following an agreement with her late Father Col@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; von Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s mö@@ s and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial requirement implies that Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers proposed by Col@@ in proposed have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in argued , that was not true , it e@@ jects Paul before , some possessions in@@ competent to manage .
in an early Mon@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he is hoping to engage the dispute .
&quot; my Italian Heritage is suggested that the family is the most important priority , he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Mon@@ id@@ av@@ its , E @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading At@@ tor@@ neys , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband For@@ ann Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ years and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood songs , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started the West as he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed her property to pass on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land at court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark were paid with 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very with@@ held , although he was a former AF@@ L committee member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV Icon .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &apos; because the case before the courts is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to disgu@@ ise myself and to pull our sur@@ name names by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father doesn &apos;t have known that Paul and I would end up in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he added that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ sch@@ ef planning to restrict the media @-@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico tells that the new staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a steady course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , met with leading employees at his first working day , he set a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s @-@ white house that he wants to repair : poor information that fall into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media di@@ aries .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a candidate was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from jobs that was to convince Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote about time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials is to make sure that his personal media consumption includes a steady glori@@ fication . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps these fight @-@ minded people know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would contain even more igni@@ tion nor its intervention .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets which Tru@@ mp is not sent .
if his employees were doing it several times , to keep away from it , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently im@@ pe@@ ach it that Tru@@ mp controls inv@@ ents .
part of the problem is that people come together in a White House that puts themselves out of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the pro@@ of@@ ten@@ ants of advis@@ ors to perform the president origin@@ ating strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ makers :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will find out how they originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February , when someone mal@@ icious a copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pi@@ le to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter due to sli@@ can@@ es , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold makers added that the then rod of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as pri@@ ver@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
Master selected crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the mi@@ tig@@ ers of the population is praying and hop@@ ed .
the police in all over Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to a dangerous criminal on the escape .
since the addresses of the de@@ ported s@@ ini@@ ster may not be known as well , references from the population will be hop@@ ed and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , following the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Christmas calendar from winter .
the experiences could have shown that many refugees hide the holiday destinations , it was at the part of Euro@@ pol .
there are 21 post@@ cards for selected criminal off@@ s from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ requested we were able to be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on warfare , who have negotiated one of the municipality of drawn tren@@ ch to re@@ claim a field in front of their manor .
the travellers have given their 20 caravan on a field outside a aff@@ lu@@ ent road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ th series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transports , after they have not been raised in May without being deter@@ red by one of the Council to prevent their fall .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and dra@@ gged their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry citizens have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they are moved on Monday evening after they were sent down from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact since he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long re@@ mitt@@ ances to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the route brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ promises if the Council cannot even stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we just saw the last round of these travelers to become pl@@ under@@ ed only by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and it is even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the battle brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to get them on as soon as possible .
in order to support our moving group , it is very important that as many inhabitants as possible to report an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct among the police by invo@@ ke 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the judgment must be checked when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opening again next March next year .
these are good news for the city .
due to the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente company company mbH and 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year went lost and also revenues resulting from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 dramatically increases the numbers of refugees who came into the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat and as a collective accommodation , which gave discussions for controversy .
the city prevented accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
in that time the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should have the right to keep it .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with head @-@ leader Birgit Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in an voluntary auction house in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s .
you welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been in front of the entrance for an extended period of time , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear what major renov@@ ations are made .
the so@@ ils have been pulled out , blankets to the part dis@@ assembled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire building building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the input area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to do a jewel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one wants to position itself not at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , stresses the Gois@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will set wide up , and outlines gravel .
both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
conversation with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already been led .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior systems are also brought on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Re@@ duc@@ ers sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia affair at US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp is designed to have been exhibiting a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
in recent weeks the body@@ board recorded the job in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote to us with the issue of familiar persons .
the paper cap@@ tioned the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expands and intensified .
the CN@@ N &apos;s first pre @-@ dischar@@ ges of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence agencies compl@@ ying the Kre@@ m@@ lin in a longer time , specifically mixed in the Presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were dis@@ agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral campaign and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the inquiries , several men should be standing , acting as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fying lens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that he has moved into the centre a few weeks ago , and I seek the accus@@ ation whether the President in the wake of the affair may be disabled in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether it should be ex@@ al@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called for charges .
mostly , they are switched on if there are larger and controversy cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned from the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office to un@@ load persons for the use below E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N Sender has already issued pre @-@ inv@@ itations to turn the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called , it was in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ers as well as his dam@@ ous election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ continues at the meeting .
right @-@ wing per@@ ished on Thursday Saturday , on Thursday , that Mu@@ eller would not let me intim@@ id@@ ate in his work and that he should be necessary , if it should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand jury will be switched on to the end to decide on the recording of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the inc@@ ess@@ ation of the atro@@ city started at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday morning a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ ors T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion which he wi@@ pes is nothing of the introduction of a Grand jury .
but these work also usually in secret , stres@@ sing .
the White House feared all measures which accelerated the work of the special ath@@ lete in a fair way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey made three times that it won &apos;t be determined against the President .
one has no reason to suppose that something has changed because it was in the explanation .
however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been spot@@ ted .
because of this re@@ tar@@ fs were accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp , he would like to inter@@ fere with the judiciary .
in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp said it to be an attitude of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
after the presentation of US media , the White House weigh@@ ted the material against the operator and its employees .
the sol@@ ute spec@@ ulations of whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
unlike an independent special student of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , which later returned to President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has led a position in which it theoretically could be led by the President of the Justice Department of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ itters set on Thursday legis@@ lators , after which the special dro@@ w@@ lers could no longer be dis@@ missed .
Ant@@ arctic : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ seven size of Berlin of the Schel@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one tri@@ lli@@ on ton heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers long pist@@ oss drive from north and will probably be two , three years until it is mol@@ ten .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the biggest sk@@ ies , researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out from him .
what extent climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of ice , is not unclear after researchers .
in total , it has existed for approximately 30 years , a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ov@@ ens in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact @-@ back@@ background .
according to many researchers , this could be associated with global warming .
the now broken down was up to now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is .
Schel@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is always growing up into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ dt was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ om@@ iting some years ago .
a complete Shel@@ omi may be broken down , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there &apos;s a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt is in danger , for the fore edge I have never withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice panel stands under voltage and can be broken if at a key@@ point just down a piece .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ fi@@ is and ic@@ eberg does not increase the sea level as it is forced on water to swim and ice as much water as it results after the flo@@ wering itself .
however , the loss of the Schel@@ dt makes that the gl@@ aci@@ ers are flowing directly into the sea with much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the short extent , the British research project describes the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MI@@ DAS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Schel@@ ery of the Ant@@ arctic .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , facing the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of a direct connection to climate change , ice sign@@ boards come now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most far withdrawal since the start of records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; confirmed he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ dt can now grow again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers did not withdraw the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to change climate change , so in the past decades there are many l@@ ending on the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
this long finish of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has declined since the 195@@ 0s around 28 000 square kilometers .
the decline has contributed to the decrease .
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula have passed over 50 years by around three degrees warmer , so in the areas where the temperature at the fastest growing .
CD@@ U aims at hand star@@ if with the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy more than the CD@@ U , calls for the CD@@ U to step out of the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the K@@ rei@@ ving got 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the round@@ trip in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have made their first working day .
the teaching at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were to be noticed for the places this year .
nevertheless the circle lacks staff to be able to cope with the sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
currently , the Circle of M@@ ett@@ mann is still not occupied by the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and commen@@ cement the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is intended to develop a concept for recruitment and development of personnel after the desire of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to exp@@ ose not only short @-@ term demands of experts , but forward @-@ looking forward of the applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented towards extern@@ ally and internally , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve an educational campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already listening to a good approach .
because the circle has it with personal problems that you did not know earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a ver@@ itable &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age of age is eliminated from the service .
so high time for action therefore , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , Leader of CD@@ U , continues with his party over the common request .
he was long ago already in the cra@@ yon day for a lazy last surprise when he made public cost @-@ covers public in question and the rest of the parties was ast@@ o@@ unding .
people want to be reviewed all the possibilities that enable an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not coming to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the round@@ ab@@ management should be with the unions - maybe also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ star@@ if asp@@ ire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tried to pay better than the collective service actually fores@@ ight for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , enhancements or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level that is oriented at career years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
just a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ating the tone with NGOs @-@ migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they are not allowed to continue in a new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said inside Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ eci@@ pe &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with human hands in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which is only in operation since one year , refused to express themselves for detailed pro@@ sp@@ ying of the Italian public prosec@@ ut@@ or Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry for us to operate at the moment not in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ eci@@ pe &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October .
it is alleged to take its occupation din@@ gh@@ y migrants that are delivered to them directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be saved , so that ships can be used again .
at least such a coincidence , only 1,3 miles left before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected , referring to the authority of the Italian coastal defence , the b@@ ail@@ outs of humanitarian grounds within the zone for humanitarian reasons and not of any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats , such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all have to have an Italian police officers on board who super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary but unacceptable but unacceptable since they were no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti said meanwhile , that the number of migrants , who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy , went greatly declined in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guard and cooperation with the local citizens are borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

for this there were three @-@ friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle - and her@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , of which you could see well above the Pf@@ al@@ zer W@@ oods and the downstream levels .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sports
do the sport stars appear in the future ahead of computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium .
fact : e @-@ sports is long since a serious branch to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high grid .
this also recognised the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ ages which are increasingly involved in this field .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the mid July founded an E @-@ Sport section and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire the whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on this train still several associations are rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football @-@ association FIFA in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ er of various clubs can compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
also Robin Dut@@ y looks great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football teams .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will also go into the stadium even in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be more often more often present on these markets than once in the year the Federal Coun@@ sel@@ dom will send to Asia .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; when e @-@ sports , computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or just the World Simulation of FIFA on a competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and with the Asia @-@ play 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe .
Ingo F@@ seal has a long time tac@@ kl@@ ed with the question .
for professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule für Köln is e @-@ sports , because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress conditions , hormonal changes .
also , there need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ seals also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard to perform at online games , and in the scene fails the structures of the classic game .
positive , scientists elev@@ ates the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are international on the way , this is like a big global family , as there are no cultural in@@ im@@ pedi@@ ments .
a study conducted by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) says e @-@ Sport a fast and fast growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales grew at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga , this is a little bit .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already further .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez on the US team participate in NGOs .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ stein .
also in Europe does a lot .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sports as a lesson was introduced , says F@@ rob@@ atics .
in the Netherlands and France the Bundesliga are inde@@ b@@ ted to @-@ register a e @-@ sport department in the meantime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared V@@ f@@ B board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to be clari@@ fied , is no longer sufficient .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align with the modern market .
&quot; we are living in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says also Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not cling to that only if football is all the way it was &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy prop@@ el to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to currency .
Car@@ ter was sentenced to life in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy did on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter could stay free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal Representative argued that both she and Mr Roy did a mental illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ amy bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes , when she was sentenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has not adopted any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se shown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horrible circum@@ stance that they completely de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity level or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want he is proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try to be with all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity with us for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was per@@ sec@@ uted by the realization , &quot; That she will never be part of the wedding of her brother or become an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with which I was together with me since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep for me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal precision , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit a different su@@ icide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 as Roy in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention to the following , after Car@@ ter Text revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; ham@@ g you on , from a building , I do not know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told there are many ways &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she sent her in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad , and &quot; All you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter sought his attention by the death of Roy and or@@ da@@ ined that they could benefit by any press from that case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Car@@ ter defended , belonged to Amanda Kno@@ x which was sentenced in 2007 due to the murder of her British competi@@ tor in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning about the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run by the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation does not lie .
something was different at his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua immediately , although the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel new@@ er was to see , he made himself the shared t@@ amp@@ er at the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria &apos;s captain .
good , the stand could have been better running than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of coach could also indicate me so .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was buried in the youth players , Deb@@ üt@@ tel and straight from the holidays met professionals of existing C @-@ El@@ f as a acting leader , but he .
sugar distri@@ butes to those most loved ones , to whom you wish to hold a lot that one wants to keep in mood .
so who was au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors to compete in the heritage of Lah@@ worm , there can be a small extra @-@ motivation but good bre@@ w .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right back , that is now its position , the white t@@ amp@@ on at the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ oto in this start@@ up as one who can take the rest of the one at the best .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal so that his missing fitness to over@@ play ( til@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus to tie to the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( op@@ ed even only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance at the Bayern jer@@ sey .
this is at all very well @-@ folded .
Sü@@ ver ran next to Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the defense , both acted po@@ unded .
the connected Napoli @-@ storm often did cri@@ tically , in addition , sw@@ amps also tried to be successful in the age @-@ building a couple of times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result was &quot; not as we expected . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; reloc@@ ating , Tem@@ po@@ Shift : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual , this part of Bavaria is still used for the new area , looked after the partitions .
for example , Rud@@ y had not existed in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ oto adopted for a couple of cru@@ mb@@ ling statements on the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting phrase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with rh@@ il@@ land ple@@ ading Minister : economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ sings
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( green ) was still a mini@@ stries of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
after more than one year , the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office after more than one year .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old prime minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; W@@ sing takes off the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around looks at Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the fun@@ eral connection of the 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
yet this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , up to 2021 the building should be right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the west part of the direction of the Federal Republic of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal government .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minist@@ eri@@ ales in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing firms .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) in Trier will be prompted by the wine of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
furthermore , I have an open ear for people who want to start a firm firm , du@@ des the Chamber of Industry .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier will see an additional incentive for young apprentic@@ es , says Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
envisaged one prize of 1000 Euro for the best known master examination and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the training training .
the hom@@ ework @-@ list for the country remains long .
in the planned road building quickly facts to create , at the same time lacking the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ cons@@ sing in the state of mobility wants to set up until 29 days are occupied .
the Chamber of Industry demands to give more jobs to external offices .
CD@@ U questionn@@ aires Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the invoice , the country &apos;s investment 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of inland roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
We@@ ap@@ so@@ bri@@ ety is one of the previous broad@@ band broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the supply of supply in a I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the note 3.@@ 4 .

at the moment , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is now out of politics and is still sitting at the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .

Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options for drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW are located - diesel vehicles to offer or to restrict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles to modify in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European Autom@@ obile Manufac@@ tur@@ ers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of Autom@@ obile Manufac@@ tur@@ ers , plants for the neutr@@ alization of the de@@ pl@@ ough of diesel equipment to install , will also take on what makes it difficult to competitive the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with ignor@@ ing the powerful Auto@@ companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices , to comply with emissions if a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities stopped Audi to have a system installed in order to get the emission requirements in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the examination could be Volkswagen difficult to charge : the luxury car manufacturer is proportional to the prize of Volkswagen .

his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he found himself among other things as a cart@@ o@@ er for greetings cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60@@ s of the breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris match , &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo was found many fans .
again and again the artists are inspired by cities .

Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institution in Provence , said : &apos; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years , which has brought much less in the spring and fall much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ dges not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant breeders with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either lack or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water @-@ distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dark from the ground , but also the tri@@ mm@@ ers of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are contradi@@ ct@@ ory to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the little town of Ge@@ isa in the Thr@@ ace R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,@@ 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Rio@@ Rio@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or they leave them home .
safety experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
you ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal emo@@ tive .
there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected , to stand on the en@@ list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no retirement from violence , and while throughout the country the corp@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are here : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to ended in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing upon attacks and threats under the Federal Protection Act and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries .
under the latter there is a publisher and its inspir@@ er of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .
its absence will be deeply experienced although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its central finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , bear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ stands , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was a Son@@ ata prosec@@ ut@@ or , it has been established to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug stores and organised crime , the mur@@ derer from journalists are rarely brought to court .
in Rio@@ do@@ ce they still insist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ restra@@ ined and although the terrain is still obli@@ que .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of safety , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to wast@@ ed my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know the reason , we mi@@ str@@ ust everything . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed just to drive a couple of blocks before his rot@@ er Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was raised by two males . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ der River . &quot;
the cap was driving away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he leaves a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation last year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blu@@ e@@ est battle fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day any one or more people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of deser@@ ted , two @-@ story no@@ ons for drug k@@ ic@@ king , which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite this and despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ d@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication might have ph@@ ased the sons , thought , gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was given to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake had not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend of Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues had ann@@ u@@ ated that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined with five colleagues on the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism , without b@@ ump into the smoking d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time the newspaper has earned a reputation for the coura@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took on .
re@@ porter loved it , hard tre@@ ff@@ led investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories which nobody else to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Rio@@ d@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue life , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must undertake the task that will fall you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in face of so many oter ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rio@@ d@@ ce @-@ team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was as a harbour @-@ bird @-@ bird , the friend , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his guard .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ón , bar across from the office , and always sit there at the same table .
well , they ask : was his love for routine practice ?
his death also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assumptions to question how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home @-@ ways and cross @-@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
if it smells , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees met by Rio@@ do@@ ce to safety training , suddenly there were no cell@@ phones allowed . days before has been known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen examined against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government , the offices of Rio@@ d@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ storey building of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police , who drew the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug policies are actually under control .
for the issue of this week you Rio@@ do@@ ce has filed on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of the government , focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ ut@@ or , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass when it was time to write when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant on drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter went out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost all the political planes .
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ rate cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous occur@@ ren@@ ces in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man dis@@ missed a military attack .
only a few months before , readers would have seen the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; I had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been devoted to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ por@@ ters Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the public prosec@@ ut@@ or .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all the country journalists have become more vocal by being written in organised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on wal@@ k@@ way and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to raise international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez ma@@ stered to the authorities , journalists and bring them to leave because they have said the truth .
she has repeatedly asked that she is divided by the government again because she is concerned that their anger violated its objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journalist , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter is not only killed by drug ban@@ kers but also by politicians and security forces , organised with organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you give because they want that you hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern limit state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer control and ear@@ phones positioned next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern limit of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue the way it was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez applied to the drug card with an editorial page on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to be assass@@ inated by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ Stadt was assass@@ inated three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ barra , which wanted to be once po@@ ets , gives that the drug stores it un@@ earth@@ ed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Rio@@ d@@ ce began on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than at once all their phones began to reach .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ enri@@ v@@ alen and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
on the edge @-@ edge @-@ edge we have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce via mobile .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity to - another s@@ late in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police police , the guards stopped to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
under the vast portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce followed their traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day , the manager was killed , she asked me to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that she could even find that his sk@@ inn@@ ed skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred to as &quot; the bes@@ e@@ ed dinosau@@ r , who was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the her@@ on period between 110 million and 112 million years .
its incredibly well received state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; amaz@@ ingly
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was caused by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more accurately .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ p@@ ups .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature has to see .
&quot; it will come into the science story as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa is the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although he is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing Pan@@ zer , probably threatened by meat @-@ send dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique that is known as bac@@ kl@@ ed , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix the better into its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ers according to the museum techniques Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7.000 hours in order to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the tree made available to Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ours over his body .
they discovered the constell@@ ations , a common defence method in the animal world , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the const@@ ern@@ ation is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today living .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs of enough pressure through meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs has been hun@@ ted that evolution has fav@@ oured the fusion of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the consoles sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ sho@@ ots - are much smaller and more viol@@ ently than boot@@ y , which is sign@@ aled that these No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ ers @-@ behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have had to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including his con@@ serving Dar@@ min@@ ed to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ r , when he died , went out into a river both out and driven into the sea , where he sank in the back to the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further down than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with con@@ serving skin , but also retained in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just need a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who were standing on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors .
this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy mon@@ ster monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology will appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was refresh@@ ed after the death in the sea and was founded in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the bes@@ e@@ ed dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it enth@@ uses two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ v@@ ore was w@@ aged by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ r keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still hol@@ low arm@@ chairs along the dinosau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it will .
hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y panels that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his right front is located at his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the sheep on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass@@ ap@@ ex bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
intense accident on Thursday nights on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 trucks are involved in a mass transportation .
there are numerous Ver@@ u@@ ties , long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon , approximately 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
according to the first indications of the police were at 17.00 hrs between the connections Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including most likely to lor@@ ries .
about the exact number of publishers are initially no information available .
it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a big enc@@ ro@@ g@@ ated on b@@ ail@@ outs was at the un@@ fail@@ ing place .
the A@@ 8 was fully suspended in the direction of Munich .
in Mov@@ ing Munich one was formed approximately ten kilometres long reg@@ urg@@ y .
like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also came on the back @-@ way to massive disability - through many G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ men notes the characteristics of the craft @-@ stri@@ ker who can now count with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock , then a second accident occurred at A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an auto@@ cr@@ ite and a passenger car .
a SAR helicopter was on the road to the down@@ turn .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or man is climbed into his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creator and w@@ akes an uns@@ killed or h@@ ates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
chassis control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German Rail@@ ways currently has the managed ticket @-@ card control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one should be taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently running a test operation on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be released at the beginning of next year on many other long distances in Germany , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket value without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already do most passengers already .
you must also have purchased using the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket sales .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one rises to the train , calling his ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customers there will be a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the train guides get on their mobile devices a message that the passenger X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
comes the train leader in the card control to Square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already made online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who wants to go back without a ticket check through our train station , check in the DB navig@@ ator simply itself .
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing board of DB long @-@ term transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , know that besides delays and missed , the chassis checks are among the biggest hassle .
for often , one has himself , in any case , but one of the fellow travelers did not need all the documents that one needs to de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the credit card or otherwise a document that you have to proceed .
the result is endless discussion among train guides and passenger cars , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart Essen .
further draw numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone of the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted on their feed , she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly committed to its Tim@@ eline .
the ap@@ pers from the territory of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed .
he sent a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ aded body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she laid her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on people at the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the crying , and of a man who said , Brow@@ ns father claimed to be a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ her police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman from a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog stood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman , his ri@@ f@@ le and crying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; remembered Fer@@ rell on her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment I felt sho@@ cking .
I was angry and crying . &quot;
you booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the viewpoint of the people living in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers .
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who had a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had lots of times before this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what to believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded them of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have a 18 @-@ year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and it and it will be raised .
it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no gui@@ le racism it is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep away from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ ist Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was transformed into a camp area than the activists locked on the possible non @-@ indictment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to accept for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met at an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites in a community , benef@@ ited by their pain and their res@@ ili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which rum in his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
his involvement brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Brow@@ ns Er@@ shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to focus on Ferr@@ er &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the revealed participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she fell in love and mar@@ ries their woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ab@@ ell history has repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which according to the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 saw the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as a sul@@ try .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .
black , gay women need to wear the basic last of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell has chosen to be selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because during a life on these cr@@ ashes as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the message cameras arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long gone , but the rac@@ ist connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is available for 2 ½ years due to the block of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the social @-@ policy atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , she we@@ ave to a voc@@ als and she feels committed to this memory , since it turned three years ago into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south@@ wards of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s fre@@ eing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while one to say to bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ending ) or simply simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ al@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers to the city , of which also the rest of business benefit , fear that the pedestrian zone will be ble@@ eding .
added : the gallery will be exactly planned on the property , on which the farm market hall stands , in the 13 denom@@ ination to market its products .
by the start of construction works there will be an end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new building - and ad@@ owed to Bed@@ a place with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying a week in the farmers market for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the owners are always very happy .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like that even during and especially after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether you engage in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the level of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they should not be low in the new project however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what shopping list in Bit@@ castle ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since this is not even a decent weekend , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains at least .
after all , the commodity offered is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above @-@ purely inexpensive .
as one sees , Lad@@ en@@ shops are located in a shopping center only from larger companies , because the dor@@ sal ten@@ ants are often not viable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special business@@ s are almost no longer and what still remains of it , will probably also disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit after Bit@@ castle .
above all : where is the agr@@ arian market during the building time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even when the bit gallery will actually come .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty does not need any one .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the won@@ dro@@ us many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ castle no space anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , will come again a piece of culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which hang almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - that hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cut that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the previous intelligence analysis was sentenced to a 35 @-@ year @-@ year prison , after having made public messages on the site Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibit which was opened on 2 August is called a coming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and cre@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and pioneering dis@@ appoint , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp - even something intellectual comment may not be created just on the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ess detection of these interpre@@ tations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since its pu@@ ber@@ ty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman was condemned 2013 due to 20 charges , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ary , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sat on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum blonde is we@@ ather@@ ed - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cig@@ ar w@@ af@@ ers and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press release of the new exhibition .
and she did not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ted M@@ use were too un@@ equal brilli@@ ance who re@@ tired several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a shot of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ sion@@ ed Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which was a future fores@@ aw in which the president of Ch@@ att@@ as would verdi@@ ct and they would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal attacks in a military attack in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is even now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp takes a war against inform@@ ants from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ e@@ ous ways to fix the sti@@ ckers that he actually should fix , continue to infl@@ ame .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things can happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a wall shown on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature including ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
the facing wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of C and GS and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ tide after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring forward is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she dives with a hands @-@ head@@ line in the hand out of the discipl@@ in@@ arctic of the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they are talking about your speech , they have won , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist that greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ant when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be looked forward in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ors that are composed of like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic predi@@ sposition were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which is also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of the killing
a country @-@ wide men hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford that were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , presented as the acts of the Local Court of C@@ ook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a member states published by the police authority of Chicago , published the corp@@ se on July 27 discovered .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries of his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was yet declared dead in the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the styles as murder , whereas the police are active according to the two susp@@ ects , told officials .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ es , Chairman of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ws must now be assessed in evalu@@ ative and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the US Inves@@ tigation authorities in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want he to stand .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a vision of their place , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a mysterious tip that had something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ish and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ual Mut@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ doping - Agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ Plan was updated in this respect , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to observe the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ual , it does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia cause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the criteria named in the list , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities must accept the reported results of the W@@ ada Auth@@ orized investigation by the Canadian Bar Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept national @-@ funded dop@@ ings in the Russian sport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ doping system has assimil@@ ated a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state of state , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ ual words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ doping Commission .
in conversation with Russian Foreign Language R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ USA@@ DA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping - sc@@ and@@ als from the execution of dop@@ amine controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ doping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main entrance of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli ; that R@@ USA@@ DA is heading in the right direction &quot; to get used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be for the next u@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you dis@@ missed anonym@@ ity , some workers were not working to the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Reed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle C @-@ suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used to measure employee commitment .
En@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the sn@@ ap pol@@ ls and pol@@ ls of specific teams , there is a heat card of the firm , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low ag@@ erial results - so you can check out why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , who has since examined a former employee a blog post , who have spoken an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment by those who have spoken .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth of 2020 , according to the funded technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect poor behavior , saw a growing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the fever @-@ f@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .

&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hotline with which employees can report a bad behavior .
and when the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is not treated badly or behave in@@ eth@@ ically , it may experience precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , worker fluid and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible has been fully aware of more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints from employees .
now as the company is using Conver@@ tible , problems that previously been made by managers who were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ capable traine@@ e faster and addressed .
&quot; I can move closer to this holistic , 360 degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took , until the &quot; Social Media came to her right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible will offer your software as a service and loads the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which support both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ tible has received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital where the entire capital has risen to $ 47 million .
he secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and received all funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising considering the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worth trying to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Linked@@ In who used both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies walk well . businesses run well if employees are using and engaged .
if the analytics tools are promising , commitment and commitment of employees to increase , it &apos;s no wonder you find support .
the data on the employee commitment is important to experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes on the way is .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments and employees can be killed .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen the company dedicated to collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I go ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly staff surveys was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise the decision @-@ making of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to re @-@ add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relation of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer then you will lose business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the brood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is at 23 o &apos;clock that enter@@ tain a lot of U@@ CL@@ A &apos;s footprint on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ oto@@ ber@@ ths and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this un@@ active minute represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final test , before going to the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man football center .
&quot; this is for the guys over the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was closed .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days workout routines to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually leng@@ th@@ ened its days - at least until the finals on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the player .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when making the brood at the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood doing practical exercises .
they are to keep up to 18 exercises in the course of August 18 , 20 before the formal game prepar@@ es for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add another point of time off the players to add another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days and it is very challenging &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply crossed it , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices when the camp is finished , which is given the clear line of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent P@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ all@@ ine class that is already rejected by foot , which will be a protective network behind a go@@ al@@ pole , no easy task will be .
bru@@ ise players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched with thinking that people rent a room there and then adjust them to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of one exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am so not too worried anymore .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles by third @-@ feed@@ backs to third parties and then display their results under the original fee then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of up @-@ to @-@ date automated learning methods to detect possible mis@@ eries and to send them to fac@@ e@@ sur@@ fers , which may display results of the fact @-@ check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main sections for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ news from which many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political topic in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with wrong stories in May , and Germany shall be pun@@ ished by a plan where social media networks are to be pun@@ ished when they do not succeed , br@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before elections there in September quickly eliminate .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement to German that I will start a test of new facts in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; besides the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ ades , third parties are challenged , the people want more context to find profound decisions about what to read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; linked article &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen the wrong news .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy headquarters in the Ar@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ h@@ exhausted .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Don@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 @-@ he years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; that is its durability !
and we always cry to smoke because at that time there is a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be doing so .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so be@@ aten with old papers , that he will be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have reviewed my welcome &apos; ) all to be true to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the month @-@ ra@@ vines at the walls and bottles , who had spent the centuries in the tren@@ ch .
it passed through the terrain and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with Land@@ scape stri@@ ves , gardening and sometimes even with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ is@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only awarded the full access to 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began just to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English , maps , which represent who which poss@@ essed : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant revol@@ t from 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver that appeared 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes .
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good beginning .
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it researcher , which conce@@ aled the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented in that of the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , he staged his own fun@@ eral , by filled out a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only later years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen used to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ em@@ es their debt crises , taking rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote awakening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique cry experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ ra@@ kal@@ i , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ las from the early 20th century , which has since been challenged by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ oping in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ ope of the 3@@ 01 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started the city of Bad Honnef on Friday her campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
as yet until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will keep the logo and slogan together by Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it should be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters of the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , they write on their yesterday released website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and in order to make clear that some better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the strong conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action you go to more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise that gives the city an unmistak@@ able one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand up in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be reached by the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign .
military re@@ agents in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan is afraid of the army
every year in the beginning of August advis@@ es into Ankara by the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ments and carriage at the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish war@@ es one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
among the advis@@ ors under the presidency of the Government now also the five Fourth Rec@@ re@@ ers as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ flow .
the government is moving to the military in the military .
General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were buried .
since the failed Cou@@ p has folded Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the connected links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup s .
against 4@@ 86 people who should have been involved immediately at the coup attempt is negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had described the lap@@ id@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to fully clean@@ se the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the military headquarters . &quot;
in general , there are concerns of a growing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifested in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large clean@@ ers at the army and security forces are at least continued .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan sent by decre@@ e more 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan did not have the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times , they inf@@ ring@@ ed their role to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly state order .
following his election victory 2002 Erdo@@ gan increased the power of the military &apos;s step by step , not least to appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned a name not so @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets this , such a development could be Nato is not cold .
in any case there is no doubt in the alliance after cleansing the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way people from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will get the candidate who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge , which of our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to make route for an increase of Renn@@ es
over the past few months over the future of the race track has been overcome - now it is going to go quickly .
still at the end of the year is to be built on the mar@@ o@@ de route , on which the tourist railway runs , built .
in order to secure the future of the race track in the long term , according to the data of the Federal Ministry of Transport , this year will begin to start work on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order the route from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ es , the country has mainly been familiar with the tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated road secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the over@@ hau@@ ling of the route is about 2.5 million euros .
this sum the land costs 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle shall also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being coordinated , explained Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the South @-@ Thur@@ in@@ ingen train as operator be already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the roadmap presented by the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that means that the race track will be ordered by the race track on December 2017 .
the race track is mainly a popular railway line between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
over the past few months , the course of a pilot plant was tested , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order it back again in the future .
the track is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
just as you thought that 2017 can not be even crazy there , a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ous Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the oc@@ ular colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; people make themselves fun , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern morality have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ licon which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the oc@@ ular colour of the robot through the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of its fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still more troubled because many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ els have developed to robots with a si@@ licon .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example to customize its users to adapt their robots to their properties , like rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ness , for example .
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; he@@ ats the site of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and you don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they also have their mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed upon conversation or it may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female characteristics , the bac@@ ill@@ ings on rape ( means here : res@@ ili@@ ating ) Far@@ rah is going to be in@@ definitely one of the most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men do not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refinement perceive something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as optional addition .
most men will of course no longer keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumption culture .
but what le@@ ak out of the edge zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until they are able to obtain the free market for this .
there is still a certain over@@ cut that these highly developed sex robots have appeared in a time where the rights of women are threatened with the world in which there is a president in the White House who has inc@@ it@@ ated women sexually .
the ab@@ hor@@ rid aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the sil@@ enced body and the outside eyes , but as realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ es ) .
their buil@@ ders want they feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities &quot; , the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing , which suggests independence or anything , which might inter@@ fere with the imagination of total subj@@ ection .
otherwise , you are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he does Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ ari@@ zed the US elector@@ ate , also have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to sel@@ fish relatives with the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives .
we are all supp@@ osedly alle@@ ge@@ dly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together .
I chose this because my cous@@ ins , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everybody knows which she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , having fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite odd on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another context that this also brings considerable risks with itself .
the left has been reinforced by Tru@@ mp , but the ent@@ ative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
as we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ ful opportunity for us to stop His el@@ ong@@ ings of one day no more .
but there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in which Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards suddenly as a by@@ word of denial .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Rom@@ ney &apos;s fl@@ ashing version - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - which occurs both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact one as very mild @-@ off@@ ences .
when Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans will only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if one does not require caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylin@@ ders - all c@@ low@@ ns are ch@@ ur@@ red and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music convey@@ s this in a decent way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer lots of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Car@@ ou@@ sel is however still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and have all a great time .
if I had to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card .
in a coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to drop the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ous when I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius transferred to the hospital with breast pain
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of mu@@ te to his w@@ rists , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was sentenced to an appeal of public prosec@@ ut@@ ors to an appeal against a appeal of public prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ cher in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , by reading it several times by a door of toil@@ et@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intru@@ der who hid himself in the c@@ ab .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ stor@@ ius App@@ ell , from which they say , be too thoughtful .
the national secution authorities said that , in the Supreme Court of South Africa , it would be lev@@ elled and the objection could be heard this year .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius said that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg finds
as the last of the arti@@ ch@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ oods and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the ab@@ normal students go in the future on the gram@@ mar school , four to the school @-@ school .
Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Pl@@ te warmly welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Mayor of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes have chosen by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les who grows in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof , but nevertheless the freedom is released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and sent it off from his chicken .
instead of a chicken cooking , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle struck up on a high mountain his wings and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders , to the w@@ ager .
the eag@@ les stand for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young would be different from the other young animals ( cows ) , but belonging to them .
but he never will be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished to treat all the neighborhoods that he accepted himself in his new school .
this followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who again jump back into teaching di@@ m@@ illing , and the parent companies .
the ch@@ icks is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she escaped her students after two years of lessons very much , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the neighborhoods s@@ äs@@ s@@ ler .
to mark the end all the students had a song of summer times and holiday times .
this broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year already eight first@@ l@@ äs@@ s@@ ler are already registered .

software update for Diesel Cars : what people need to know now
how accurate is the software update take place ?
must diesel riders participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of about 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the exhau@@ st behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of Ace Auto Club Europe gives assess@@ ments :
is the new promotion compulsory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ ating updates previously are valid only for the cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fit has arranged the fuel @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will the customer be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but they do not yet have an exact date .
Daimler has communicated , to write every person affected .
if any inspection may be required , it will be done in their frames .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the slopes depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntarily do not act the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
Zeit@@ auf@@ ach@@ ers could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE obli@@ t for wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would draw , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
does a massive prize inf@@ estation of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but even in the regions where Tim@@ bu@@ cks thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there are so far not added value for older diesel so far .
the ACE tra@@ itor , with a sale still wait .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the passage is already written - suitable candidates are still ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press meeting .
it reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for its successor .
at the same time , mir@@ ac@@ ulous that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a building engineer at the next time .
this is how it should be - taking into consideration the regular notice of notice - yet enough time for a processing .
da Has@@ lach for the administration @-@ community as a sub @-@ law firm , the applicant must pres@@ criptions corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they cannot fill them with them , the citizens should have to go to Offen@@ burg .
but the neighbourhood of the city and itself is important , W@@ acker says that of a good working atmosphere and a good mood is reported among citizens and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have gathered to the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident of the building of the building and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the ra@@ ho@@ y parking space are about .
the S@@ ven@@ ties between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , as well as the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will be@@ ech with about 1.5 million euros . &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all just wait great tasks to my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
be aged for a city master of great room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener was able to react quite flexibly to many times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker , and the creation of green plants , it is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the old city as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what rein@@ forces &quot; when re@@ constructions are approved , empha@@ sizes the cra@@ p Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor remains long , W@@ acker desires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker should study according to information from the city of Has@@ lach a completed study as graduate engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s studies with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulation and building law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ takes high @-@ level and deep @-@ building planning , atro@@ cities , administr@@ ations of urban areas , municipal establishment , with construction and municipal authority , including monuments protection including monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern train locked locked
according to police the previously un@@ known k@@ iller had thrown the blue bike of the rail track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the cables .
these were so strongly damaged , that the issuing goods must be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene we were witnessed a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike riders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ en@@ coup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators have taken themselves in danger and are also endangered by rail traffic .
apart from the damage to the lo@@ k and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , the rail customer could also return to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether there was a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the railroad track could be guided without disability .
just under 10 person@@ ages were Friday morning , two of them concerned the long distances .
Gü@@ ter@@ ings did not stand out , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 meters upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and poles have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ able bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .
the incur@@ able state in the US affecting around 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , the stomach fighters and ble@@ eding , recur@@ rent or bloody confusion , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those concerned are usually advised to allevi@@ ate meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner Universität found that the essential amino acid trac@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant digestive system .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling , to ensure that p@@ est micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , which are able to compens@@ ate inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue .
when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory disease .
in experiments has been determined that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ o@@ cell on mice occurs , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium is needed Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial and l@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflammatory intestinal diseases , even if the same system continues in humans .
the post@@ doctoral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found that a group of study mo@@ wers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , who had not been accommodated , this did not had .
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
the dy@@ m@@ mets of the mice were sket@@ chy and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment , so that they had not been a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria count on the immune system , the researchers have grown L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ances of the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if researchers re@@ doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the fo@@ d@@ age of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ gs have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us are protected by L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ utilities from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells with people like mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory diseases .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ gs in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius . &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut on Wednesday .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday starts , and impressive in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Szcz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , MA@@ TIC was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve at the beginning of the Premier League .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent missed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three other new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new@@ ts .
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they were four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer had seen the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , the drawing began but in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner via the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar @-@ umbrellas the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was an endurance for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo has been painted into the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind doesn &apos;t turn : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD boss , saw social democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stor@@ ks of the party central , merely no antagon@@ ism from the covenant - so lou@@ der the most important desire for the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamentally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus with growing det@@ ain@@ ting the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were deep sh@@ out .
and that one after the other .
the federal CD@@ U is seen after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a generi@@ c signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fac@@ tion@@ ction of a Green @-@ Members wrote the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the landmark election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ citizen Michael Kellner has asked the Ab@@ dul@@ ent Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the trans@@ cription to the CD@@ U means a clear reproduction of the elector@@ ate .
El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive leader and electoral campaign of the Gre@@ ens Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seu@@ do@@ zt an SPD election fighters , as on Friday afternoon the new hi@@ ring message was reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , stands on the rem@@ nant of the green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ west to CD@@ U without own ruling majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD .
and nobody knows what next comes .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades of his time .
after the agricultural elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it then became even worse - and it was all significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Tau@@ ern , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smooth .
the comrades in the weeks went afterwards again .
then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next pi@@ vot@@ ings came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD member , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did in crisis communication then pretty much everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival .
now even Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW , the car@@ bure@@ au and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Minister @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister had already been in criticism for quite some time .
mi@@ xes re@@ frac@@ tion@@ values came to this end .
nevertheless , or perhaps straight , tried to put W@@ eil over the past weeks getting stronger , in the Bund acc@@ ents .
the aim of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they left him , as they spoke by W@@ eil the stabili@@ zation of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
in this case , W@@ eil passed on the cross @-@ party constra@@ int , which is basically no fault .
and Martin is not at all .
at times , the comrades call themselves to keep their own ranks closed .
their wrath is located on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the cru@@ mbs of the Par@@ isi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms. T@@ west poses their own career opportunities on the interests of all others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the party &apos;s party in the SPD parliamentary committee , the Red@@ ac@@ tional Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ west has not been elected by her person as a director did@@ atin , but by the federal states of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , such as the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on dep@@ u@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD member state , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elector@@ ate happened four years ago was clear : people made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD as a top @-@ candidate in the German Bundestag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ members of the W@@ ah@@ er &apos;s result , &quot; said Mr. Op@@ per@@ mann further .
he called for clarification of the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it has been continuing commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
funding for local center III
who wants to rep@@ ent the house in the years can soon get support from the country .
Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg City development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the informative event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler had even seen a retro@@ sp@@ ect of that until now .
since 1991 it was placed in delicate renovation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has not adopted two thirds of the total assets .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the internal development , and not only opening new construction areas .
on April 4 , one will receive the information on the Government Committee in Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment III .
the funding amount will be 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which more than 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received .
what is the result of a refur@@ bish@@ ment ?
you will continue to explore such ind@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role as to escape in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the region could then also be postponed again .
the ten@@ ders represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal government @-@ program &quot; Social city &quot; in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out then .
core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal crises , improving living and working conditions and maintaining infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is to be done per property .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment would then eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the closure period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year would first take stock of the inventory , in the context of which the participants received a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional command should be made possible , so that the coming year with the refur@@ bish@@ ments can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality must carry out the said pre @-@ investigations .
it is about evaluating the city &apos;s urban ab@@ uses and decide when there is re@@ organisation and to what extent .
there will also be a refur@@ bish@@ ment in the log@@ book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again be received once again and make a picture of the situation he spoke .
Got@@ a stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and Basic Palace , &quot; where it deals with the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a housing space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operation bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is observed that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not beneficial .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of the funding after the &quot; Wind@@ dog Princip@@ le &quot; - who first comes , it gr@@ in@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusion were still photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project in order to make the present &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor requires himself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a microphone , so that he can open its door@@ step , entering its office and even start a car movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ er an@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , hang@@ ers , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to alter the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per ch@@ ateau .
the married father of one now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which is when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter elev@@ ates to South La@@ wn for an event that lifts the American production last month , costs tax pay@@ ers according to the information of the military , which have been left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Deputy officials of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 states .
the helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , following the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I wanted to know that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Mar@@ ine@@ kom@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter met on 17 July at 7 am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and remained so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 clock this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would require a return flight .
the original flight was during the helicopter during the helicopter during the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground by plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether the final flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bid federal property to use stat@@ ute property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; one question we asked , was whether this was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political upper @-@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ an@@ ed the efforts for the cur@@ v@@ ature of the government regulations .
using the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is uncommon .
Tru@@ mp was conducted in February an investigation by , when the Presidential aircraft against the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services and his Twitter account is full of messages regarding the use of the presidential plane by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; the White House is amazed by the Show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 States showing that by American workers will be made with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training trips in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn by specifying the US President in the White House with precise zen@@ ith records .
as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 resulted in the White House 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event en@@ umer@@ ated at the training needs of flight time for the month , said an official .
Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew over 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ qu@@ ites presented on the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold budget@@ ary design@@ ations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to as@@ certain the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Defense Secretary for the fiscal year 2017 the DO@@ D budget is available for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the flight over 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the real cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers set in the basis of estimates for generating sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many others hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand @-@ Study from 2015 , the rates for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ect@@ are , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ect@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut are very proud of being contributing to our national security and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been working ti@@ rel@@ ess .
it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his circuit over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the seat &apos;s seat of fire@@ works .
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and Ash@@ er with the media above his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tob@@ ell@@ end@@ ure Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite his five games ever , imm@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance has become the leader of the second tennis @-@ Bundesliga to receive the sense of reality .
the manager Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has at least respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays a similar Formation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just in the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , most of all imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their dem@@ ons and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ j@@ erk@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will always be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need a good serving luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
it is the moment that the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella become active French@@ man not for the Bundesliga game , comes with the tournament in Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ inhabited Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ ellip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the A@@ TP @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
in Kiel , it should be as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Zand@@ vo@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vict@@ ories on the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could return to the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was in January 2016 the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors world cup , not , fill someone from the trainer starting at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .

nevertheless it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil concept .

roll back@@ wards : the town presents 46 kitchen
the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with permanent contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban areas of day@@ care , the watch is revers@@ ed .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the urban areas of day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , acting head in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked in addition to house : a Cat@@ erer is taking over this task and provides fresh ch@@ opped cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the district of 46 children &apos;s daily sites , in 44 the kids get a hot meal for lunch time .
in the past year round , 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are looked after 45 week@@ days , in the k@@ ita , for lunch , &quot; explained Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have served from 1 September kitchen service : you war@@ med the s@@ mu@@ te meals , add them to salad , raw materials and fruits , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; workers are firmly assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are branches as well as sev@@ enty facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the chefs now belong firmly to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more involved are involved and it is easier for the condition to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is a healthy diet and a cooking lesson .
&quot; the children should help them prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is very useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be completed in the future by special cleaning personnel .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost between self @-@ regulated and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical way , it is called out of the press .
and that , although 46 divi@@ des are re@@ employed .
&quot; but these hours drop approximately 750 people in the education area not so strong in the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

GM@@ B concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make themselves a trade union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company was silent on the future of investment at the Tol@@ l@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , in addition to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties The Pla@@ dis said he has invested over 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union officials &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their actions would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branches of the company , GM@@ B Scotland called Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ organizer tri@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the future needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus on the local community and the Nordic Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production slow@@ down , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently calls to a flu@@ ori@@ fic production .
spokes@@ person on Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ gi@@ ers in Tol@@ l@@ cross did not get a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment with employees and trade uni@@ onists .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GM@@ B representatives in Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with employees that we operate like all companies , who are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate that regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our business operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not be shown in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having failed a quotation of £ 189 million to release his clut@@ ch clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years before the world cup ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the trans@@ fer@@ window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Szcz@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar is used for the most expensive professional players in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ lete of the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries from more than 500@@ .000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is angry about the way being forced on how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a spring has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of it .
but was the football world warned of three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association , who wanted to sign the one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , with the Spanish club put in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the abuse @-@ waste @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
he means the author and histor@@ ian Michael E@@ emann .
the final report for the ab@@ sc@@ andal by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen carries further for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication opposite the German press agency , he expect from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest in@@ co@@ w@@ ning over one &apos;s own is@@ sions or their then incorrect assessment of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however critici@@ zed that in case of coverage of violence at the domin@@ ations with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the superi@@ ors in Regensburg no one doubt that it should be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; act , be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ i@@ ker@@ in and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committees .
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils to design@@ ate is already part of the daily life experience and prepare the public opinion that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one walks on the church and this is a spot@@ ted fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with my children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair ; today set standards for previous decades because the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse cases , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often also used .
completely wrong , author and historians Michael H@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the souvenir band &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he adds value the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that was submitted to the lawyer by Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg under education at the lawyer of Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 rainbow @-@ cats were treated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , therefore , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emo@@ tionally , the punishment of the students were able to fall apart .
in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants , many victims falls the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , even in numerous cases , even to have positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ emann , why the final report for the ab@@ sc@@ andal made by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; Pre@@ vention of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives an contradi@@ ct@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , many students raise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appeared as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , who has become hand@@ some of the Ö@@ f@@ teren , if a domain was musi@@ cally opposed to a top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael E@@ emann : if you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was at all found in it .
he has just been devoted to eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any susp@@ ici@@ on of the medi@@ a@@ ean or fellow @-@ acquaint@@ ance with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence also occurred at the pre @-@ school events out of its impact .
at the moment , one can pres@@ um@@ ably throw away from it too late or not to have taken first hint .
the Dom@@ let school , on which he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so also the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , describes it quite excellent witness , &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; knowledgeable , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely ben@@ ured teachers , who burned the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always enc@@ amped by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emo@@ tionally , which also has led to t@@ ut@@ ro@@ ids .
that he was not only black@@ ened with chairs and the keywords , but also ear@@ chers , and all too che@@ ek@@ y guys moved to the hair or ears , he himself has already given years ago , deeply de@@ plor@@ es and apologi@@ zed for this .
to his honor , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widely used in the fra@@ gment time , the 1960s and 197@@ 0s , with parents such as teachers .
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium , too .
compared to what this report is actually written in this report , namely the ab@@ usive sexual abuse and the non@@ violence in the pre @-@ school , are the ad@@ mitt@@ ently dre@@ am@@ els .
then one asks herself if it was not more with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just rus@@ hed to him .
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , still hur@@ ry .
the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , the report has been reported very much about the topic of misuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any winding or co @-@ bl@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael E@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ esses claims to have entrusted the dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never suspected to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a sad@@ dened substitute for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the true issue in the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how to evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : a frag@@ mentary student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in the opposite ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had his timely findings and have been able to have the respective perpetr@@ ators .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to take up that after him ... be@@ g inv@@ aders or more or more opened , than with their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ gli@@ ders , confidence teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up , a student and / or their environment , it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from each room@@ mate .
thus he cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded , prevent him or to have brought it to the display .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to this rel@@ ay crime , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is caught in the report &quot; away . &quot;
do he need to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ emann : this is the big problem in which coverage everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again a abuse of the report .
namely , namely clean : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well , we say once , other inci@@ dents .
the report also deals with the report from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir manager of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole terrible examination , the cases , in which cre@@ dit@@ ch of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ les teachers have been settled and mal@@ ign@@ ant , all together at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states have to have existed .
but with which Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys just to face when they were already on the domains school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this was how the most witnesses emphasize the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the school @-@ school school ?
Michael H@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just does not sa@@ di@@ ous violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many sacrifices made the general humanity of R. and therefore even have positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus remains at the most still the accus@@ ation to have taken away .
however , despite all efforts the report could only define two periods of time , in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 @-@ 71 , when he started to establish itself and was responsible from the events at a school , where he did not want to hear , and was then only once again in 1993 .
ro@@ oss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ spar@@ se high school , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed out this to it , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school we will continue to practice the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press release he recommended the following incl@@ ine .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity was existed , as proo@@ fing was banned from Bavaria too .
before that , they manifest themselves in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably knows .
there was also difficult to estimate for him where those affected may perhaps be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but you can not say it , he always had sli@@ pped away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the inspec@@ tors were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed it is unfair , the current pedago@@ gical standards apply at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ emann : we are able to talk to historians as from the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus to evaluate the dangers of past present moral standards .
there the Princess has already been right .
but this does not matter of course not for sexual abuse from which at all times was vile and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school for rel@@ ying and violence at un@@ trained kinder@@ gartens , which goes far beyond that time .
that is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ sol@@ em@@ y and re@@ tire to hair and ears were widespread in the 197@@ 0s .
as physical existence then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his rainbow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the topic of testing also in language ?
Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am not sh@@ ad@@ owed by no means that he led there a rigor@@ ous reg@@ iment .
but this must also be said , without this perfec@@ tioning , without the un@@ demanding discipline , it would have been unlikely to exist , from the until then rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of world drank , true cultural ambass@@ ador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 , 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , right in which area , but still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the conversations with their book ?
Michael H@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as mir@@ ac@@ ulous , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ faithful and heart @-@ good people from whom you could not imagine that he could do something in a fly .
I get on a regular basis , like many former domains , still today , 23 years after his Em@@ mer@@ ing , regular contact with him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him to this day , that he was once strict with them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him that he enri@@ ches her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a hard father , certainly , that may be - but yet also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and to dis@@ honor them .
and please , not even quite clear : all you need to pre@@ ach are educ@@ ator methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he has promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother , to his medi@@ al sin@@ king .
there is the n@@ asty intention that it stands , just too apparent .
for the report that was just published , was reli@@ eved him .
now , the rising areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has purchased great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
