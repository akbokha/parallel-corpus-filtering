<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people should come across.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel where the tunnel is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardeners manage the one-day reasons for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not currently up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everybody who had already exciting, because the car Navi took place a green meadow, instead of a circumvent road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportals in Bavaria of the State government, everything else is current - yet very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area-area of Münchner Mercury had changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large clearer map, for cities and communities, all-called maps, so-called originals.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated in accordance with the Bayerische Vermeasurable Authorities between 1810 and 1864 and has been presented to the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader took part in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II war.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria at commissioned - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops served with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: today's neighbors that the idea of an area-covered Bavaria map was created.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV was ahead of the project ahead," "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermeasurable Authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The presentation of the city of Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others to be found on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, which emerges in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today there is a slate in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses substraps are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where now the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when hinjoma appears a small disadvantaged card with dozens of lines and numbers: handcrafted items from the so-called "urine," which was derived from the property tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small pitches do not occupy there today no farmers - but small tenderness in the complex" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Carnival of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century indeed still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the case of the new district Au-Haidhausen has not only read the street name "at the Gasteig" or of the "" "" On the Lüch "" "" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the auction road there are once people with insinuations.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich district of the Irrenanstalt" "" "at the Auer Lüch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, the institution - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for the accusation of the so-called misses." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged himself for an exhibition of the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had first been place, later was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular anstalt in hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich is located since 2006, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the area of the former Auer Anstalt there are young people in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The medal twary the building in 1920 and turned him into a teenager with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children-house "Casa Don Bosco" - built in architectural approach to the origin of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the MarienPlatz was marked around 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the Purcherstraße was" "" "Kaufinger alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought about the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained to the present day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftchapel from the Middle Ages were once standing at the Marienhof, where these days are working on and on 5th April 2017 the spade-bite for the second S-Bahn platform is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of colored has issued a warning for color people that discriminates due to discriminatory policy and racist attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the federal state Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, requires Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take care of the state, as a number of fragmentary, cash-based occurrences in recent times throughout the state, and here it will be noted," said in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injury of civil rights that men happen.</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group incidents such as racist decay against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more during the journey and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report of the office of the general state-country-old from Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than women.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring conflict, or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri came out at the end of 2015 in the year 2015, after the latest numbers from the hate-hate review programme of FBI, representing the state with respect to the number of such injuries at the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to clash a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Travel warn of Texas and Arizona, had issued the local law enforcement authorities to suspend people because of immigration violations, resulting in the opinion of ACLU for further streamlined profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel orders are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times interested parties have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weihaloproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidemarn project is a success project and continues next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamantorate Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the court yard of the family Schwendemann the representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-village association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the" "" "female" "" "project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers have often been in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 with total 25 plots from eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conservation area is 40 hectares, which cannot be enforced until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 Euros, the half of the leader was funded, a quarter carried the municipality of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">Therefore, to fade the farmer 12 610 Euro, which had to invest in 16.2 kilometres to Weideity.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landwives there is not." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The municipality of Landslinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state Promotion of Weidecelestick.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-named Förderisse.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the alleged surface area may not be par-ppery (lifting about 35 per cent), and must be threatened with the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher Weimar Project 2018, the application is currently running eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The operating surface corresponds to 35 hectares, which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta by CNN beyond the proposals made by the President on the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty Imitators would have omitted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid hold of their significance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta despered:" "" "I don't want to enter a full thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty... an icon of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually right, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your fatigue, your poor, / your pressed masses, who are longing for, free to breathe, / the elding waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elder waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed not to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they did a high-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a shared classical appearance.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change from right wings to a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great screenshot of the Rush Lembaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one to check, but rather an early neoconservatives, who bring the American flame into the umbered world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was there to see her as they had from the exhaustive but hoped people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people that seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not illuminate the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which are compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m track while Eiliie Doyle was chosen by the crew for team caption.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain speech was amazing, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were choty or wherever they live or exercise, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh was totally natural, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of Silver medal, who is competing with their fifth World Championships for the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British crew.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">In the past year Muir stacks has resulted in five British and two European resins last year.</seg>

<seg id="150">The crews capitals say that they are "enormous" to the fact that many of their compatriots do not belong only to the team, but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be part of the team is that it was elected by the other members of the Team, so it was a great honor to know, but to know that my team-mate have voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the carrots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to Podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech affects as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put this home-in support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: do not take you a public ministry if you cannot tolerate the native of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans played George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers routed him because of all, from internal politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shook at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogoose employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and erased that voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties complained that this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>

<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="174">He has the second largest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very glad to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate its hairy head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockade of those who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum, which is officially designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax currency - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogocherin Amelia Chasse the acts of the governor and argued that blockade of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolling or spammers or brasserted people, which fluctuate online the whip.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent inverse issues of European footballers, will not bother Neymars World Cup transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come to Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer crews from access to the most prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by UEFA 2011, mean that PSG would have to point at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros (262 million) to buy the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar is received a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure you do the money, so Neymar diswrites and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy of the glorious reign of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may opt for the acquisition of players a lot of money, but they must steer with legitimate entries, which allow them to enable the Break Pardesiring point in their way to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Sini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had given enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheating and cracked to ruin, when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the crew and build a global brand - become a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year subscription period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million Euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Unmerade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to cry from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly is FFP not dead and we will further strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a 5-year contract, allowing the solution to be paid for the next five years to the amount of 44,4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG was granted a €60million dollar (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the crews are required for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 to 21 players who otherwise remains normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs which could try to exceed their financial reviews by drawing their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While an Catalan enterprise could be the PSG-sponge if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was applied by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar has been made to make payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar Cup-Ambassador will be easy to find out of such maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive every attempt to observe the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, sagging on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring-Deals, merchandising and trikotellers.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association will assume that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will rise.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was definitely mistaken to see one of the best football fans, and tried to prevent Neymars way by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial intelligence "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in terms of the latter ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state which is financed by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is a consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football during the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life exists: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I searched for something that was comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square miles has been completely rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end they gave the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for yodelling.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on each other, so the architectonical challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel plant is rather complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the spaces so that they were stacked over each other without having to bucks." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms at full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Spicy gold furniture, silly accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer space for all cutedge and glasses of yozanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the intensified, frightened MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so if you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne offers additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the base size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you fell not in the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment itself can transform itself through good design and increased square meters. of a slightly astonishing into something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico tells that the new staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Stabschef of the White House, met with leading employees at his first working day, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps-white house that he wants to repair: poor information that fall into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diaries.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television reaches back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when a candidate was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from jobs that was to convince Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote about time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials is to make sure that his personal media consumption includes a steady glorification."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fight-minded people know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would contain even more ignition nor its intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweets which Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees were doing it several times, to keep away from it, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently impeach it that Trump controls invents.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people come together in a White House that puts themselves out of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the prooftenants of advisors to perform the president originating strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmakers:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he will find out how they originate." ""</seg>

<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter due to slicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as priverus, but Trump is still his impulsives self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the adherence to withering conditions and because of the diseases-transmitted insects weakening, leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institution in Provence, said: 'the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years, which has brought much less in the spring and fall much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cickade, a microbacterium, the dwarf-cades, and with very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil lodges not only for vacationers, it is also highly sought for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant breeders with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE and either lack or weakened.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly RioRiodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state Sinaloa through the organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children with the office that were in 2009 the target of an attack with granulates, or they leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal emotive.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected, to stand on the enlist of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no retirement from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are here: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto ended in December 2012. 589 are standing upon attacks and threats under the Federal Protection Act and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Under the latter there is a publisher and its inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be deeply experienced although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its central finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, bear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, its nightstands, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was a Sonata prosecutor, it has been established to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug stores and organised crime, the murderer from journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unrestrained and although the terrain is still oblique.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to wasted my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the reason, we mistrust everything."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed just to drive a couple of blocks before his roter Toyota Corolla was raised by two males. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with "Twelder River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was driving away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He leaves a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans remuneration last year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the blueest battle fields of the country, since rivaling political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day any one or more people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of deserted, two-story noons for drug kicking, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget about a minute that there is a state of" "" "rest" "", "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite this and despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartons in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication might have phased the sons, thought, gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was given to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake had not to compel Valdez after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend of Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long, that his friends and colleagues had annuated that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined with five colleagues on the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without bump into the smoking dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took on.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treffled investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories which nobody else to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue life," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug dealers in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must undertake the task that will fall you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummen.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in face of so many oter... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodce-team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was as a harbour-bird-bird, the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayón, bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, they ask: was his love for routine practice?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also compelled them to ask their own assumptions to question how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home-ways and cross-ways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce to safety training, suddenly there were no cellphones allowed. days before has been known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen examined against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government, the offices of Riodce in a four-story building in a mid-storey building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police, who drew the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug policies are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week you Riodoce has filed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state of the government, focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the public prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who kidnapped or how it came to pass when it was time to write when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant on drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter went out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which ruled almost all the political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of high-rate cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous occurrences in this eatery, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman dismissed a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, readers would have seen the columne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"I had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was caused by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy pepups.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature has to see.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will come into the science story as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa is the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivores, although he is covered with a armor and resembles a changing Panzer, probably threatened by meat-send dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a parachuting technique that is known as backled, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix the better into its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Borealopelta markers according to the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7.000 hours in order to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the tree made available to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armours over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the constellations, a common defence method in the animal world, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the consternation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today living.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs has been hunted that evolution has favoured the fusion of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the consoles shaded - think of deer, zebras or Gürshoots - are much smaller and more violently than booty, which is signaled that these Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carniers-behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have had to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his conserving Darmined to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went out into a river both out and driven into the sea, where he sank in the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South-orida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further down than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conserving skin, but also retained in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis in the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by someone of the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the road" "", "said it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else had posted on their feed, she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly committed to its Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The appers from the territory of St. Louis was involved, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He sent a picture of Browns leaded body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She laid her cell phone in order to return to Tweets on people at the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the crying, and of a man who said, Browns father claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusher police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman from a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog stood.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "another policeman, his rifle and crying," "" "I will kill you... animals all kill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," remembered Ferrell on her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have used to accustomed to and which we can call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt shocking.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and crying. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the viewpoint of the people living in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrel with her daughter, who had a flower-dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had lots of times before this morning, "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you do remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what to believe?" "" "reminded them of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are going to Ferguson because the police have a 18-year old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and it and it will be raised.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no guile racism it is no different from the next black women-child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florist Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was transformed into a camp area than the activists locked on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to accept for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "" "" "I had no experience in organizing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met at an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often from whites in a community, benefited by their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan said recently in an interview," "" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field which rum in his activism around Todestrakt occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other indigenous people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Browns Ershooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was to focus on Ferrer's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the revealed participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show surprisingly personal aspects of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "as she fell in love and marries their woman." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrabell history has repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which according to the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 saw the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as a sultry.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women need to wear the basic last of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not affirmative type of action," "" "when Ferrell has chosen to be selected as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because during a life on these crashes as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime the message cameras arrived in Ferguson long gone, but the racist connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is available for 2 ½ years due to the block of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "it describes the social-policy atmosphere of the area they call their home:" "" "a mess." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "Megalahn": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southwards of the pedestrian zone divides the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers to the city, of which also the rest of business benefit, fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be exactly planned on the property, on which the farm market hall stands, in the 13 denomination to market its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">By the start of construction works there will be an end.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which hang almost incomparably identical - that hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircut that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the previous intelligence analysis was sentenced to a 35-year-year prison, after having made public messages on the site WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibit which was opened on 2 August is called a coming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and creing, a Transwife and pioneering disappoint, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp - even something intellectual comment may not be created just on the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the induress detection of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but since its puberty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman was condemned 2013 due to 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granary, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sat on a driver's seat and a platinum blonde is weathered - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project "stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigar wafers and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press release of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she did not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainted Muse were too unequal brilliance who retired several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a shot of Shoili Kanungo Illusioned Comic "Suppressed Images," which was a future foresaw in which the president of Chattas would verdict and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal attacks in a military attack in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is even now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeous ways to fix the stickers that he actually should fix, continue to inflame.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that "things can happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a wall shown on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature including (the "i" in its family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">The facing wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of C and GS and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nukleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring forward is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she dives with a hands-headline in the hand out of the disciplinarctic of the United States as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they are talking about your speech, they have won," said it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "" "said the artist that greeted me from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get geant when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be looked forward in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, from their own genomic simulors that are composed of like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also focused on how everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), where their genetic predisposition were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which is also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the wax to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, speciality groups and demographic groups to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to handle C-suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used to measure employee commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Enrett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and polls of specific teams, there is a heat card of the firm, which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low agerial results - so you can check out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next uber who has been involved in scandals, who has since examined a former employee a blog post, who have spoken an environment of harassment by those who have spoken.</seg>

<seg id="2224">When a company is found that his staff is not treated badly or behave inethically, it may experience precious consequences by consumer boycott, worker fluid and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convertible has been fully aware of more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or e-mail for the company central, a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now as the company is using Convertible, problems that previously been made by managers who were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or incapable trainee faster and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2232">But it took, until the "Social Media came to her right," that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convertible will offer your software as a service and loads the companies with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors, which support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convertible has received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire ventures and Tola Capital where the entire capital has risen to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">He secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and received all funding to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worth trying to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn who used both Convertible and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach renders when their portfolio companies walk well. businesses run well if employees are using and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools are promising, commitment and commitment of employees to increase, it's no wonder you find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee commitment is important to experts of the workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that changes on the way is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, these disappointments and employees can be killed.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kotter International, which has seen the company dedicated to collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise the decision-making of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to re-add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relation of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 can not be even crazy there, a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerious Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the ocular colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves fun, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern morality have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, "and select everything from the ocular colour of the robot through the form of the nipples to the type or the colour of its fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still more troubled because many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would make a stepford-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpels have developed to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to customize its users to adapt their robots to their properties, like reluctness, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," heats the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and you don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they also have their moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed upon conversation or it may be" "" "in mood." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female characteristics, the bacillings on rape (means here: resiliating) Farrah is going to be indefinitely one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement perceive something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course no longer keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leak out of the edge zones, can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until they are able to obtain the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is still a certain overcut that these highly developed sex robots have appeared in a time where the rights of women are threatened with the world in which there is a president in the White House who has incitated women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abhorrid aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the silenced body and the outside eyes, but as realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Propores).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want they feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to its "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing, which suggests independence or anything, which might interfere with the imagination of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise, you are counterpart slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He does Mitt Romney as the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate, also have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to selfish relatives with the horror of Trump relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly allegedly to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousins, a leftist poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everybody knows which she knows, including the Republican relationship, having fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite odd on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in another context that this also brings considerable risks with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been reinforced by Trump, but the entative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">As we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gratiful opportunity for us to stop His elongings of one day no more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is still a terrifying long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing, "which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards suddenly as a byword of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Romney's flashing version - the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - which occurs both in comparison to Trump in fact one as very mild-offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the Carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carouells of New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if one does not require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinders - all clowns are churred and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a decent way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines will become familiar to offer lots of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Carousel is however still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, a 11 year old and two women in the 40-years can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had to rate the carousel I would have given him full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In a coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to drop the rating with a 15% tipping - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologous when I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to the hospital with breast pain</seg>

<seg id="2453">He killed Stecher in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, by reading it several times by a door of toiletine in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder who hid himself in the cab.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to this time to the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say, be too thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national secution authorities said that, in the Supreme Court of South Africa, it would be levelled and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammable bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state in the US affecting around 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, the stomach fighters and bleeding, recurrent or bloody confusion, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those concerned are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner Universität found that the essential amino acid tracyptophan of proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the gut are patrolling, to ensure that pest microbes that hide themselves in the food not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to compensate inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments has been determined that a type of tolerance-promoting immunocell on mice occurs, which carry a specific bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium is needed Tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial and lactobacilli - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less anti-inflammatory intestinal diseases, even if the same system continues in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found that a group of study mowers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, who had not been accommodated, this did not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dymmets of the mice were sketchy and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they had not been a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria count on the immune system, the researchers have grown L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerances of the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophan in the fodage of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopgs have been halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us are protected by L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>

<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it was finally important to promote the internal development, and not only opening new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, one will receive the information on the Government Committee in Karlsruhe that there will be a refurbishment III.</seg>

<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann explained that every municipality must carry out the said pre-investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating the city's urban abuses and decide when there is reorganisation and to what extent.</seg>

<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House slowed the presence of the helicopter in an fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn landed, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report unloaded Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the abuse-waste-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">He means the author and historian Michael Eemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abscandal by the Regensburger Domspatzen carries further for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication opposite the German press agency, he expect from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest incowning over one's own issions or their then incorrect assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "however criticized that in case of coverage of violence at the dominations with" "" "two measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the superiors in Regensburg no one doubt that it should be prevented "shameful and shameful acts" act, be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree medial manipulation," says the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historikerin and member of the National Italian Bioethics committees.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils to designate is already part of the daily life experience and prepare the public opinion that for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis meant in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" one walks on the church and this is a spotted frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, they pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a very normal pedagogical means" "" "to be done with my children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair; today set standards for previous decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse cases, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often also used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historians Michael Hemann, who translated with Ratzinger the souvenir band "My brother of the pope" (in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to accept Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Eemann," "" "because all that had nothing to do with him" "", "he adds value the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that was submitted to the lawyer by Bistum Regensburg under education at the lawyer of Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 rainbow-cats were treated" "" "victims of attacks, 67 domains" "" "victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, which was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, therefore, that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionally, the punishment of the students were able to fall apart.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims falls the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, even in numerous cases, even to have positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hemann, why the final report for the abscandal made by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "Prevention of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for example, many students raise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appeared as choleriker and perfectionist, who has become handsome of the Öfteren, if a domain was musically opposed to a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Eemann: if you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger was at all found in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mediaean or fellow-acquaintance with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence also occurred at the pre-school events out of its impact.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At the moment, one can presumably throw away from it too late or not to have taken first hint.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domlet school, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents - as literally - "salvation," heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes it quite excellent witness, "sincere", "knowledgeable," and "understanding," as extremely benured teachers, who burned the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and "always encamped by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionist and its high emotionally, which also has led to tutroids.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he was not only blackened with chairs and the keywords, but also earchers, and all too cheeky guys moved to the hair or ears, he himself has already given years ago, deeply deplores and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor, however, it must be said that such educative methods were widely used in the fragment time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium, too.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what this report is actually written in this report, namely the abusive sexual abuse and the nonviolence in the pre-school, are the admittently dreamels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then one asks herself if it was not more with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, still hurry.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report has been reported very much about the topic of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any winding or co-blity with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Eemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assesses claims to have entrusted the domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never suspected to speak with my father or mother about it," "" "said a saddened substitute for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the true issue in the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the Domspatzen student Ratzingers role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a fragmentary student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in the opposite (Georg Ratzinger) had had his timely findings and have been able to have the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to take up that after him... beg invaders or more or more opened, than with their parents, internatsgliders, confidence teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to a clear result:" "" "that in the run-up, a student and / or their environment, it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from each roommate.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be discarded, prevent him or to have brought it to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to this relay crime, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is caught in the report "away."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he need to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hemann: this is the big problem in which coverage everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, namely clean: between the pre-school and the grammar of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well, we say once, other incidents.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with the report from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir manager of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible examination, the cases, in which creditch of sadistiles teachers have been settled and malignant, all together at the pre-school in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen where really skandalous states have to have existed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with which Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys just to face when they were already on the domains school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this was how the most witnesses emphasize the theme" "" "pre-school" "" "tabu" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the school-school school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there was already discipline, but just does not sadious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many sacrifices made the general humanity of R. and therefore even have positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus remains at the most still the accusation to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts the report could only define two periods of time, in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970-71, when he started to establish itself and was responsible from the events at a school, where he did not want to hear, and was then only once again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rooss Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domsparse high school, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he pointed out this to it," that in the pre-school we will continue to practice the results. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press release he recommended the following incline.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity was existed, as proofing was banned from Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they manifest themselves in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate for him where those affected may perhaps be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can not say it, he always had slipped away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the inspectors were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it is unfair, the current pedagogical standards apply at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we are able to talk to historians as from the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus to evaluate the dangers of past present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the Princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not matter of course not for sexual abuse from which at all times was vile and also not for what was broken in the pre-school for relying and violence at untrained kindergartens, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishment, thus earsolemy and retire to hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical existence then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his rainbow" "" "has" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of testing also in language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not shadowed by no means that he led there a rigorous regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said, without this perfectioning, without the undemanding discipline, it would have been unlikely to exist, from the until then rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world drank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988, 1991) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, right in which area, but still discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger at the conversations with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hemann: by working on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as miraculous, humorous, deep-faithful and heart-good people from whom you could not imagine that he could do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get on a regular basis, like many former domains, still today, 23 years after his Emmering, regular contact with him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he was once strict with them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him that he enriches her life and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a hard father, certainly, that may be - but yet also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and to dishonor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, not even quite clear: all you need to preach are educator methods that were at that time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he has prominently and has an even more prominent brother, to his medial sinking.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty intention that it stands, just too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just published, was relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now, the rising areas would have acquired a 93-year man who has purchased great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
