Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston has not always been perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put into drawers or conf@@ use from the outside label who have mostly little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ b to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine . &quot;
at the evening , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre @-@ tv with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ y and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for whi@@ st@@ ling , they carry the question after the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a all@@ ot@@ ting mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from the 25th of August .
gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ ids
his experiences on horseback are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their finish , they jag@@ ged in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p to the feed at home .
at a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and therefore the riding career ended then again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament specimen - back to horses .
he left his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ amp he does not stand for photography .
long was the first time in Aachen , and also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German co @-@ operation over@@ looked the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyram@@ ids .
in distin@@ ctions it lacks the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ...
even the British Queen has already tor@@ ates him .
the 18 winners of the Sport@@ pyram@@ ids .
in Aachen , he met his first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro as well .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the triple U.S. Mast@@ ery winner has been recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent members include the athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Fe@@ eder Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ ingly Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ste@@ er Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports centres had come on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society went into the jumping stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
clinics and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - this is both Clinton and Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential election are however in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt more small in doubt and war@@ ns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and adjust to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand would be completely different , claims tru@@ mp .
he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations and it makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and need money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ dless .
the Democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly out@@ rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ amm@@ y @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there are still partial discussions on tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wishes to build coal fired power plants and re @-@ drive the carbon promotion in the USA .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to den@@ o@@ unce the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is aiming to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ ce @-@ trade agreements , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US by international trade - but simply American jobs are better protected .
those should then be paid better then calls for instance Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger .
he wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp is to do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ack@@ down , then he says , he could not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizen to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , so that the budget deficit would be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least want to demand from the rich rich , that they pay more taxes and whose critics say , more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone escape , almost certainly to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women .
each has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he looks curious to the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
they sm@@ iles short and kiss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene functions normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the department manager of Con@@ d@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are planted .
in Munich &apos;s north , they live in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all@@ u@@ gh@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Sagrada and Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s help .
recently she has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is an Wach@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has been on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee for wars because they are per@@ sec@@ uted politically , because they will thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hop@@ pers to Europe , &quot; she tells .
in women , other reasons for the run : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly from it because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , Hon@@ orary mor@@ den , slavery or For@@ ced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tractor for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they anch@@ ored in Germany , told B@@ ahr .
also here , all women in refugee centres would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ mat@@ ured and hard@@ est if mis@@ used .
this leads to about 90 per cent of women living in Munich &apos;s area , trau@@ mati@@ zed , trau@@ mati@@ zed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t get to help you need more accommodations just for them , she challenges .
the seven District govern@@ ors in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in the governments of the governments .
also in Schw@@ aben , alone women are not divided into separate , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and medium @-@ French , there are some common facilities or separate houses for all women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing the privacy or will find men and women together , it may come to - continuous violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the washing rooms should be easily accessible and for women easily accessible , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this protective need@@ y , one can be on the spot , which there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; since he has spoken all that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily set a second house .
assistance for assistance : demands for new work amp@@ action
dep@@ uty assistant have called their trade union to approve new work boo@@ sting in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Medical Association ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded his entire advice from beginning of September more working amp@@ ly measures .
the J@@ DC said that it had failed to address the concerns about the contract .
assistance and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ ent have voted in July about the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract which was agreed with B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; of problems which led to the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Management Board coordinated the proposed new contract fully reject and reject official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee has today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to approve a running program escal@@ ating work@@ mates which starts in early September .
the disputes led to this year sixty @-@ general strikes , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of B@@ MA assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the establishment of the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he informed B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still ahead of the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ ent , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced compar@@ atively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external specialists &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands to their hands and to pre@@ ach an official end to the last eight months of war in terms of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin got his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot express myself that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was the envel@@ ope , yes .
but Putin att@@ oo@@ ed sm@@ iled sm@@ alli@@ s and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for its back @-@ keeping circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the contrary , he repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but they will even improve .
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that if there would never be anything bad .
his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite rather than the opposite .
but one of the be@@ zz@@ ling , sustainable cooling showed that the head of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first one which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory lecture : the shot of a Russian figh@@ ter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was burnt .
Putin told and accused Ankara , Russia to be in the back .
the failure was even greater , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
the cous@@ ins will rebuild itself becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the nation@@ ally controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
at the most serious , the accus@@ ations of leading officials from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have benef@@ ited by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has done this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message heard that it was time to look forward .
finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology of the President Erdo@@ gan , whom he wanted to hear .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month with a coup d &quot; é@@ tat was on the top of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are taken back .
you are counting on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week forecasts the state of the state of television for cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti imagined it as follows : &quot; tourists staying there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it was reaction to the tried of power as a weak response .
to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll is coming over the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ pi@@ ous to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West .
the Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty for ensuring that he was asked for the elected state of state support for the elected government bodies .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a matter of course that has even changed a deep @-@ se@@ ated fear of reg@@ iment .
the summit in this g@@ gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made available to Russia and Turkey , one as it once said to me an an@@ alysts , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs , &quot; : two countries that are ch@@ ased by the West and were poorly examined .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two parties .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support antagon@@ istic sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talk , both the President during the press conference said that they had not even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey for@@ bid it pur@@ pos@@ ely to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disp@@ ar@@ aster , NATO &apos;s member Turkey was struggling to combat the Russian mar@@ tial arts - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talking to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the leader of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland with that brand R@@ BS were associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ancing itself as she had almost kol@@ ni@@ fied and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , Trade@@ marks &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds for sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange to Nat@@ West are changed .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private clients , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , since we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue a global goal , but to pursue local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely , and our employees will work among these trademarks .
R@@ BS has already told that there will be no longer any six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will raise the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , for how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this become a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the leader of the board .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal before three years , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and put these marks .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks back , so I think the time has come .

the three @-@ star winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is here too
I am very happy about the fact that it has happened to New@@ market because I am here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er when he pul@@ ls the victory in Pre@@ p@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstru@@ ction - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed twenty @-@ time winner of Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a re@@ aring career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prizes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only steps before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambass@@ ador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma excited fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6.000 gains if he would not just be a weekend and grand@@ stand @-@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has more than 30 years of winning players , which is great .
he has a vivid personality , what is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible yod@@ elling .

three years ago he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character@@ ize strength to de@@ fi@@ erce his doub@@ ters and to return to his best .

Russia Putin mo@@ ert St@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his staff Minister Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ ro@@ west of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport matters .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged the dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Ivan@@ ov@@ s dep@@ uty , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it is called ( in Russian ) that it was later referred to as the manager and administrative manager of the government .
about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a state of legislation on legislative acts and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the most ridic@@ ulous faces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has made Moscow mysterious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has long been one of the eng@@ es of his intimate Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as a St@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , he was broadcast on TV , claimed both the men who res@@ ign his staff on his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one .
but the official argument - that a man who was once more tou@@ ted as potential president , had to lead to Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - a job for four years to trust .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he previously worked as Minister @-@ President and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Council of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FS@@ B ) , was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin told the power he called Ivan@@ ov more than one of five men whom he trusted .
once was thought , Ivan@@ ov went to President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third presidential term should be ch@@ oked against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin &apos;s ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .

que@@ fied Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
£ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the nor@@ deck of the Queens@@ ania Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four per@@ si@@ tions of the &quot; cover blo@@ om , &quot; which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge cut of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ sei@@ le .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy K@@ eit@@ h Brown left a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ boro Cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly epic extent during this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the Brü@@ cken@@ deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a prayer for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Constru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each brid@@ ging project .
in this fantastic project the zi@@ pper presents trend @-@ oriented high @-@ building and deep @-@ building .
after installing the last tram section and its connection with the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the full gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern states of 700 millimeters at the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massi@@ f because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tonnes , and when a gradient of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances were working on which the team works , tiny - on each side they ru@@ sted them only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; fortunate to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were cast away from their fishing boat in front of fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station shot on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew was watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around itself and placed us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds that is already blow@@ n out of their reach until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 , and at one bu@@ cket without b@@ ail@@ outs was found .
they all went on board the Coast of Coast and were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men were cast into the water , fortunately un@@ hur@@ ried and still be alive .
the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop , however , this sol@@ ves in the k@@ em@@ n of the boat from the person who charge the boat .
someone has spoken today about these men .

this alar@@ ming result of his sister .
together with her partner the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to re@@ assure her brother .

who builds cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green Policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is going to lose nearly 1300 favourable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept for living . &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost goes to the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will in future be 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can also arise in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall may be , as viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can one deal with investors to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal residential construction program that will cost millions of cost and will still be financed , should provide enough incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U aims to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants har@@ sh@@ ness conditions for investors .
regardless of what , as viol@@ as , bah@@ s a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the experts .
but the program is not yet entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 favourable apartments whose support is going on in the coming years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone through the year 2020 .
to prevent this , the planning policy in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out by the city now .
moreover , it would have to be thought to take apartments back into the price connection .
this is possible in the west city .
one stroke will be able to solve the problem .
because in the west city the year @-@ end deadlines are running .
around 1800 apartments , one could get back to prices for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the construction companies .
for example , the number of social housing in the west city has dramatically increases , the aim of the so @-@ called mix @-@ mix .
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens assume that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U has to take into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more places for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that there can be no compromise .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child can no longer walk out there , but rather to spend their free time , on screens , was fired in the last decade of many lam@@ ents .
at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and to get active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not close each other .
I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on characters who first were created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of pop@@ civil@@ isation , the interest in front of the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand early July somewhat .
the market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphones are searching for out and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who were tr@@ acked with a GPS once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the expectation and sp@@ rang out for the quest of the sofa .
in the USA the game led to a considerable rise in steps that determines the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5,000 users per@@ sec@@ uted , the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of per@@ sec@@ uted folks that train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for an increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get involved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ judged .
who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
in this way three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also lively games that have always been compl@@ aining about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist will be combined in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

and now at last also the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world prior to the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was definitely in front of the silver medals and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ team kam@@ pe@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Bil@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the pig @-@ balancing during the individual multi @-@ campaign group at the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro , 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americans who wins a multi @-@ election title and altogether the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fies their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she lost tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment was an end .
this success presents them as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ ly has dominated the last three years their sport events - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises , that the ol@@ in@@ ator from 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in that I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected a last examination in Brazil , a competition , which did not so much between Bil@@ ly and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American , Simone Bil@@ ly , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ class placement of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ it took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party of the team of retirement co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a cre@@ mation .
although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted on the lead , never to have planned the future , it is not really true .
some of its floor exercises - which contain their typical tumor type - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the road outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother discovered during a school flight into the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ ded , became strength .
she has not lost a multi @-@ campaign competition since the summer of 2013 , a victory series that will last as long as it desires .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two la@@ ths easy , dec@@ ep@@ ed the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ it holds the World title - lou@@ dly .
she again fet@@ ched with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beam and put it on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently as they were expected - a pure form - and tears flows on Bil@@ it gl@@ oss red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once was described in their collection book , for reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the Bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams had been called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

as for Bil@@ it , the beginning of this week has a quite new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series cases when hearing in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the k@@ ern@@ most attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Male@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ators got eight shots from a hand@@ ball @-@ monkey , while on the side of the car was standing and fled afterwards with another vehicle , can be read in the report .
the police communicated that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who found themselves owned by adult victims .
the police spokes@@ person from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting broke the investig@@ ators to be a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic residence were killed in nine attacks seven people and two further in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , shared Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects multiple vehicles has been used , including a brown ni@@ ck out of the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to declare the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Male@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the s@@ late that was abol@@ ished on an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and prec@@ eded it was the work of the mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sle@@ eves and secure a ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ mente from the motor room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his Alter@@ enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy did nothing knew .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought I managed not .
I do not create that .
I did not let me left .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has drawn down to it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund shall never know it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise Him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ashed until his third year , and he still cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the character , which Ed@@ mund gave me something out of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him character to him , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked ever , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know it .
I have been asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I do not expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth @-@ threads caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fi@@ erce rain falls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
severe rain @-@ cases and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to rest on Friday the emergency room . it is counted all day Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the South of the Tri@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their shores and dro@@ ught with large @-@ scale floods of extreme rains , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Ed@@ wards shared with that national authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ den of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for flood @-@ cars , boats and sand@@ bags are multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ y system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather permits def@@ endant that in this area additional 3 to 5 inch could be dropped to rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , on Friday there was a floo@@ d@@ hot @-@ system , while Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach a record level of all probability .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be sw@@ amped in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a current floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger since these are flowing only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
the river tick@@ l@@ v , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , finished on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 the highest stand which was ever recorded .
rescue team still t@@ apped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his Sti@@ ef@@ s@@ ohn were found among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which normally lies more than 400 feet from his house , over night strong climb .
he said that he would have warned another Sti@@ ef@@ s@@ ohn , who lives nearby .
&quot; we are awake and the water flows and poured out , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Glo@@ ster where they were accommodated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had quickly spread &quot; herself , as there were heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , there was an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday was considerable reduction .
the authorities gave that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish and thunder@@ storm in five quarters .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a attendance in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 super@@ ded houses ang@@ ulated .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which now have both floo@@ ded .
the officers of the church Rob@@ by Mill@@ er said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven P@@ ets which were r@@ ins@@ ed from the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond have been decorated Not@@ aries to host the evacu@@ ate people .
&quot; once the water starts rest@@ rain , they will be back into their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were provided almost two un@@ used streets due to the flood , and sand@@ bags are provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and stores .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said Li@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in ti@@ pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Co@@ unt@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the Gulf coast .
according to his data a handful of houses have been reported on Thursday as und@@ el@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported so far .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I had never seen before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;

on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a cross @-@ bed on the arm when she played in front of her house in the west of the West Oak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Frauen@@ ol@@ ymp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ah and for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been doing so since 1984 during every summer period and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ it , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie , Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ le is , off , makes every pride .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was under the female gymn@@ ast an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was an amazing ol@@ ymp@@ ic teacher and America che@@ ered .
now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ atic types provided .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women gold .
cre@@ at@@ member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but they do not see turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all smote the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ ed Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are just four tur@@ ers in the team . moreover , that is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality tells us that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents for training , interior , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . this list will continue to be desired .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the gymn@@ asts obtain its entire training and that is a more expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ f .
we must be inspired by the congregations au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , with a high @-@ weight and easier to access trainers .
I was founded my gym of 20 years .
at my events we have complimentary and affordable housing in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban juven@@ iles ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) performed and trained national and international winner .
in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth up high @-@ quality turbines that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
turbine develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit .
this combination offers vital benefits for health as well as school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew , which thousands of young girls to take care of the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ i and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team captain and thank you , F@@ ass to become so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant would like to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who voted in a choice , refused him .
in July , Hunt had unveil@@ ed his plans to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance centres shall receive a new contract , which contains changes to bed@@ side and weekend work to improve the care of the w@@ elling watch times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the B@@ MA Committee for Assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assi@@ stance have shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance statements made to the proposed contract , in particular that it is applied to the current availability crisis and to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for just eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA to solve the disputes through conversations with the government on the sake of re@@ members and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened to that of a promise , did the Jerem@@ y Hunt for the last month about it , that his door would always be off@@ ending .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt has to act now , to raise the compensation and contact the assistance of assistance . &quot;
if he did not do so , they have made it clearly that they are ready to carry out other work amp@@ actions .
the last strike in late April saw an impression of almost 13@@ ,000 veter@@ an operations and 100.000 Termin@@ i before , since hospitals were included in the strike post .
the ministers hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through a assumption of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wishes to provide a better week@@ day payment for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance systems that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working fight @-@ measures do not reach anything but little , but they already over@@ loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patient , nursing staff and their families only worry , poverty and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of Assist@@ enz@@ el@@ arians , and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries positively respond to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other major topics - like posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses and gender @-@ specific wage @-@ making in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Health of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the imp@@ aired drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart inf@@ ring@@ es for persons with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the medication is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the regulatory body of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory body of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from heart attack every year and a quarter of which suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by an@@ zes fet@@ ched material in the ar@@ tery walls , forming the co@@ verings .
when the flooring breaks off , it can cause a blood cl@@ ash that is blood flow to heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood@@ shed is dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and st@@ oves the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk a further .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ da , and is driven under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots in@@ likely .
the entry level of Nice , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor carot@@ le Long@@ son , director of the Nice health @-@ based evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , have suffered a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astrous consequences .
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience reveals that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart inf@@ ring@@ es and stroke accidents among people who had already had a heart attack .
thanks to a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risks - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the approach is recommended not to go beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess and makes election in Muslim regions blos@@ som
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man became last year on res@@ ign@@ ation of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ital has led to that widespread voting was ignor@@ ant in Muslim municipalities such as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , electoral watching and Town H@@ alls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ ties and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municip@@ al Government , who is now an ant@@ corrupt secret , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tre@@ adm@@ ills outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should take a ID , in order to prove their identity by elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er must call its name and address .
the report suggests , not remot@@ ely to apply to the finger of a person when they give up their election , to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for electoral financing , but is also intended to protect municipal government from the broader corrupt and financial intermedi@@ ary culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged from the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man after a l@@ itan@@ ism on the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ for@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in the Cypri@@ ot manner , &quot; and that he had brought to silence his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that there is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person cho@@ oses another .
Sir Eric said that there were no evidence for fraud throughout the country .
it is particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out the identity to prove the identity .
in his report it is stated : &quot; being proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ en@@ eric background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that ... government institutions have such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist letter optional will work in order to stop &quot; election . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration veri@@ fiable to prevent that the electoral directory is used to im@@ mig@@ rating and social security purposes .
consider options to ask for your ID before the election .
not remot@@ able ink will use on the finger of a person as soon as she has made her voice to prevent that somebody has chosen twice .
systematic audi@@ tions about the nationality of a person conduct to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic let@@ tering .
ban on that political activists can work in full letters and envel@@ op@@ es of letters .
the police have the authority to set up portions .
a change in change , which facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( public agencies in 1983 ) .
photography in campaigns .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tro @-@ stations ( except of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters are going on their own into the electoral board .
Sir Eric is falling over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; astonishing , &quot; after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no off@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ u@@ ties for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corrupt and illegal practices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been attri@@ but@@ able because of a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ised the in@@ discri@@ min@@ dless &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the constitu@@ tion@@ ings of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; The Angel festival in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is called a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying and conce@@ aled expansion of electoral fraud and the leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ detached and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are dedicated to this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from edge and band , which proved to be an impressive col@@ l@@ essor in the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year ol@@ ol@@ kin , this summer is by far not the only one in order to give gold batt@@ ling ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if they may believe the social media .
to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympics , that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Horn@@ í &apos;s most famous .
the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
except K@@ ates doubles , on the bicycle track , many people on the Internet tend to be a certain ar@@ cher in the Gem@@ ini from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave them that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any major simil@@ arity with exception of the facial hair , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I find it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly enter the centre : the striking simil@@ arity between the British fores@@ ight Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to pass through as a col@@ l@@ essor for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user &apos;s view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
a further comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , whereas Americans was att@@ oo@@ ed to Adrian von Fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football @-@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only : a Twitter user was very happy about other the similarities seem too .
theory put into the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in stated its satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC kop@@ ed and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter @-@ users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and gave a message .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast it .
yesterday we quickly apologi@@ zed to our audiences at the show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ adequate and a un@@ fortunate formulation . Byr@@ on is doing what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was in the show and tried to justify his observation , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment I have made after the women &apos;s wallpaper in the C@@ BC Olympic , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am referring to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to it as a person . &quot;
of course , there was no cont@@ emp@@ t intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ geous about women , who are in the midst of business sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman rep@@ ented their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ st@@ alled how she looked at it , she moved out and laid her back into the shelf .
they continue to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman put the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she re @-@ pulled back and left the business without something to buy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right in the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ law@@ suit , pulled out her own whirlpool and tro@@ users , and pro@@ bi@@ ased them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried not even to find a slightly dis@@ crete place to do it - it was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone &apos;s star@@ red when they with@@ drew the under@@ p@@ ants , which you obviously not liked it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t write anything down , and went down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching somebody - or think about the person who might buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she had already tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how hard to think that someone would take home with a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; as I got along , the staff tries to withdraw the clothes from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had she and she had not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is a incident occurring on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone , consciously . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ceas@@ ing weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to move up with armed rob@@ bers to close distance .
regardless of whether you look at you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate your th@@ ief for your rob@@ ber .
if you look around you from the back then you should turn to the first , so you can see your att@@ acker , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee into the bar and twi@@ sting you , while the att@@ acker faces pain k@@ ills , the weapon from his hands . beat his face to the face and move back@@ wards while they are pushing the weapon on it .
when att@@ ackers , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the sh@@ utter line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun from his grip before they move back@@ wards and direct the gun towards it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video in order to accurately see how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ ain@@ ting .
but remember that there is a prey on the safest , your money will be ski@@ pped - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian W@@ right W@@ right for a guide to the bre@@ wer in Europe
a British motorhome under@@ went his immune system and saus@@ age a serious test - by taking some of the nar@@ si@@ sts and det@@ est localities of Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and Travel @-@ author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k narrow his course on a euro shot , a rail@@ ings at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing but@@ to@@ cks as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the res@@ ili@@ ence of its immune system .
before departure of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he gets involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ war@@ th , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought to le@@ w the r@@ ins@@ ing a draw@@ back , which was already used by thousands , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually there are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical specialists spoke about the encouragement of bo@@ wel bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he dimin@@ ished , more than a bad taste of the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by having traveled through the world and the peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things ate .
from public funds to train stations through to rin@@ se valves , the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ stitute showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rium of over 4000 units .
as compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rium is freshly picked up less than 60 .

Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel agency &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ war@@ th , &quot; which shows the number of people in different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have had in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I am not going to le@@ ak here because it is in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ated here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ war@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish maker of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company @-@ ow@@ et Mr. W@@ right with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we led crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings that ended with it that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he had some of the things I have instru@@ cted to le@@ ct him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty ti@@ treats on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents conducted from 2015 , in particular with the wellbeing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products that are included with l@@ actic acid bacteria .

a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment for del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because it wre@@ cked its neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were rolled at their property by their estate , sho@@ wer@@ ed owners of the apartment @-@ operatives found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
walls executed by shi@@ el@@ ding holes on wood di@@ ps were ri@@ pped up , gar@@ bage was disp@@ ers@@ ed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was hang@@ ed on the walls .
the family were sigh@@ ted and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management near Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is feared that the apartment does not repair anymore .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street struggles with bas@@ eb@@ radi@@ i , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug stores and excessive scre@@ ams , stretching and fluid .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ ll was found
it were tra@@ ded in the estate , which was tra@@ ded in the past drugs called wood ri@@ mp@@ s .
neighbours said that they had to fight her on the streets and had to be inv@@ oked on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fied her and her partner this week tremend@@ ously by the property , after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily sur@@ ate .
the dolphins have been ac@@ claimed by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their lives has been made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send greeting to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the community house , gar@@ bage and old toys have been thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it dre@@ amed to the ten@@ ant , every responsibility for its behavior and family , as it is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration .
it was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful to look at their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who were coura@@ geous to receive and give us the information provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will be con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the floor
workers of the property management will now have to be gar@@ bage in gar@@ bage , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found about 70 g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ pers and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don has received a fine even after it had found guilty of the owner of a threat of class B into commercial view .
she said that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don be , who came to life in 2013 .
after having no shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant ten@@ o@@ iled not to keep the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold at the house@@ order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ confidence as well as in those who were har@@ med by such a conduct &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never tolerated by criminal and anti @-@ social behavior who continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tru@@ mp Co@@ t ″ form@@ idable problems ″ in voting
the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concern , also in traditional conserv@@ atives , to order their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp gave now weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large sp@@ ur@@ onic and self @-@ confident p@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is such a bit as concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having dis@@ continued 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , now the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians who asked for support in important provinces such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took up his famous media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can High Bur@@ gen W@@ ack@@ ets
U@@ tah is normally a safe bank for the Republi@@ can .
a survey conducted by serv@@ o USA from June according to June according to Tru@@ mp and its bank@@ rupt from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied to the question as to how he wants to stop the Adv@@ ance Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and believe , I will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make any more to tell than &quot; the truth . &quot;
if it does not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it al@@ right , &quot; Tru@@ mp said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press , the Party of Tru@@ mp is alleged to cut funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present better demand values .
instead of it , we set up the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster fraud with doping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian Commission .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics threat@@ ens to continue after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a reason@@ ing trial in the Olympic Village Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olymp@@ ian committee shared with , immediately a discipl@@ in@@ arian Commission , to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ aries had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was a first @-@ in @-@ trial under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ called F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ch .
that was the team of the team member k@@ eni@@ as reported by the doping super@@ vis@@ ors .
the World Association IA@@ AF , the IO@@ C has requested information on the case to pursue their own investigations , shared a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures in the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) is gone to the intelligence control station and presented itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ch , the sample was made and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as CEO de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was in the possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for the training checks of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Championship .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics heads of Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
it is alleged to have been informed of the mental doping of his country on forthcoming intelligence tests .
as a result , media report is to be arrested at his return to the airport in Nairobi .
Kenya is already playing a number of intelligence processors in the IO@@ C for longer time under special observation .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 intelligence targets in front of the Rio Olympics , more than 2000 intelligence checks before the Rio Olympics , was uncommon to be noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ doping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the end of Olympia .
subsequently , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose intelligence doping with the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reporting the ARD , the ARD were repeatedly raised , that the funds are readily available in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
member of the IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und also called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ floor covering and systematic t@@ resp@@ ass was systematically destroyed .
Russia L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ eten were excluded from the summer playing .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a Musi@@ cal conquered Salzburg - the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the Musi@@ cal in the Classi@@ cal Temple , filled with the role of Maria a youth .
in the orchest@@ ral , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ ic conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats .
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and tune .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we were am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older ch@@ ant@@ ine Mary .
she is reminded of melanch@@ ol@@ y in her dar@@ mer@@ y with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel , oh so , I feel and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I as a Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an in@@ hibited man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his bli@@ cks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance of sharing this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American film@@ maker Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
these are the same themes and they are just as powerful today as they were then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war area - to prevent people from taking this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA and two other school cities went out from the east of London into an airplane in Turkey and then moved into a bus to the Syrian border .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish Church is counting on mass tourism
&quot; whoever does not adap@@ ts and Erdo@@ gan sits on packed bags , &quot; says the name of the Gü@@ len @-@ Close foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community Germany is counting on short notice with ten thousand prot@@ ect@@ ators that flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believes the vice @-@ president Ali Top@@ pen@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard approach of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Church Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quick calcul@@ ators with ten thousand prot@@ esters in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought against minorities and democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the exile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ pen@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government was re@@ tired in months ago by Kur@@ dish floods , they were 500@@ ,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , still sec@@ ular and op@@ position ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state which itself takes refugees in its own country refugees , &quot; said Top@@ pen@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ and@@ sch@@ ef def@@ endant the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evidence cities .
to that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the li@@ pos@@ al shift to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been de@@ pl@@ ated or displ@@ aced over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ pen@@ k , which is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the exile urged that the federal government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp like Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ches hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I did not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also feared the flight of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ positions .

like the newspaper , under vocation on figures of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture , the Turks created the biggest group of critic@@ isms recognised by the coup in Germany due to political prosec@@ uting .
as of 30 June , this 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus have been entitled to an 29 percent of all as asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey will not be held before war , poverty or fu@@ tility .
asylum justified according to the Basic Law is exclusively political , thus of state page , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go there where it is we@@ dge . &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer of election with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not be able to choose land .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
from 2021 the landing of the pan will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament approved the start of the year .
because so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ grand@@ children - that is accompanying itself .
the n@@ atives who are to be convinced by the electoral campaigns are on holiday .
most of the holiday makers , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not native people , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the plac@@ ements , bub@@ bles , fl@@ ashes , fl@@ yers , and end in the end votes , only lab@@ elled out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make an election campaign against the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : prime minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 has been the strongest party , in surveys it is clear behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling will be tri@@ mm@@ ed as strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D and what remains at the end to the end .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and leader of Prime Minister , has an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from its large pl@@ ap@@ points .
he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it did before his legendary key@@ word Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise he got past@@ ed feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the blo@@ om of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the sp@@ le@@ ction spe@@ eding up , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Interior of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place campaign .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to wholesale , Merkel ( German Bundestag ) , located in the northeast .
but the target group did not coinci@@ de , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Württemberg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at the ND@@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed at the usual campaign resi@@ stor@@ s on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
this , so , Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also notes that you take the base from the country to find it very strict , again to find a wire to the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast@@ ness of the country barely there .
the Council of the CD@@ U campaigns in Kok@@ ert and his collaborators : &quot; you must go there where it is we@@ dge , namely where people are : Dor@@ ar@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday celebration has to be used . &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ am@@ ering has now called for an especially dedicated election campaign .
the Socialists and Democrats recently stood by 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD won still be won with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Mini @-@ party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to create the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue from the holiday @-@ need and place their election r@@ ins@@ ing great @-@ part into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ campaign &quot; calls it the chief of Claudia Müller .
apart from that , green electoral campaigns set on sp@@ ur@@ ch@@ search for native stimul@@ ants among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t is straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ castles lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; full holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renov@@ ations : visiting sites suffer from block@@ age
at the quick@@ ness , with which the B 27 is renovated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible persons concerned , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is al@@ enth@@ al@@ ot praise .
&quot; they did everything quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the mid @-@ term as scheduled for the south , until the end of October it should be ready .
blessed shall also be the det@@ ach@@ ment of those responsible for the work @-@ works , about when it comes to setting up co@@ el@@ ises .
since the construction site on Monday to the south is washed and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , so that the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has eas@@ ed itself , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed .
the citizens can now run by O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming back through the village seems to be back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that for the traffic @-@ technical management of the restructuring responsibility Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many per@@ plex@@ es were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to many trucks in residential areas fran@@ k .
since the speed of speed was not observed , the community also urged the truck @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable over@@ runs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who himself would like to know about the situation itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was with 77 h per hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site it has been moved , but it was quiet .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men are not allowed to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ reconstruction in them has led to sales breaks , everyone is asked to look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , for other companies , has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also with the car from Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also one that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strongest is the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
not only him , but all the hosts have made it hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales embar@@ ked at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road @-@ building took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has requested a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there is a financial compensation , with the reference , the guest house benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now it also needs the disadvantages that carry out through the restructuring .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where such a kind of gener@@ acy has been acquired .
in all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled in 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other regular cust@@ um@@ ers are now subject to complicated traffic control less frequently , he can understand .
if you cannot go by , it is also somewhere nice .
that his master cli@@ ent@@ os after the end of the renovation works again , he has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and bir@@ d@@ age , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 @-@ works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long standing history .
six months of construction , which is already brutal .
constantly being rob@@ bing in the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick@@ ener security package .
but what has a job state to do with terror ?
and what does the co @-@ partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Justice at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not asking for anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also , I share myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as an interior , he was well located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reco@@ ver@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , where he will drop a bit of time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are now all the more extensive .
a lot has already been known , declar@@ ing , that a new security authority is to take care of the b@@ aking co@@ ded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
for part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals made with the SPD so far : he wants sympath@@ izing for terrorist groups under penalty , and jihadi@@ sts with a dual citizen of the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spatial of the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still consider this to be reasonable and still challenge anything that I have no chances with the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway .
a few new ideas will be presented to Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
the majority have it in itself : he plans to move fast @-@ off de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for induc@@ ing people from displ@@ ac@@ ement .
refugees trying to get them into the country before they checked their smartphone and disclose social @-@ media accounts for a safety examination .
in case of failure for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than before - about such , the crimes commit , or throw away their papers to dis@@ connect their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ ches also still works un@@ le@@ ased and leaves open questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and on some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be put into dis@@ agreement that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg &apos;s refugees were .
in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee crisis concerns the security .
and things that are deeply occupied by the people now , they have not settled in an election campaign .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the hits in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore focusing on internal security increasingly in position .
in the last few days between the two parties went high .
only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the resort is also demanding a Bur@@ ka ban and a stop from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also happens here to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
of a return from the double @-@ pass he kept nothing .
we have the discussion in Germany .
you are new to do , be not useful .
and by a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tive at all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er , does not have to show itself yet .
there is a lot of dr@@ ating what might take care of them .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile himself in the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party head Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled carefully and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still comes Volkswagen gli@@ der by .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als the supply numbers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
on the recall , there is vor@@ tex a term .
Volkswagen starts with the disp@@ er@@ ation of the first half @-@ year in the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s biggest highway can continue in the course of the past year despite the diesel @-@ wide thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets further a plus .
however , in July , the core of the VW is weak@@ ened in Western Europe especially in Western Europe and res@@ umed the total sales of how the company wrote in the D@@ ax company .
in the world , the brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same period of the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , the sales stood 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ted the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost a six @-@ sixth .
brand name Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all at two sale days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it has given a trade agreement in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aside from the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the res@@ ign@@ ation of the EU also bur@@ dened , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA where the exhau@@ st first escal@@ ate first escal@@ ated , is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
major support for VW is the Chinese market .
altogether , the mainly affected households of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is anyway further gli@@ ding by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a transmission minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to be a sales track from January to July .
1,3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen in that period , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software qu@@ ad .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station to the customer after the conversion , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in a company trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the basis of legal truths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen has granted his German customer a guarantee for per@@ ed diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last Monday VW was confirmed in the Federal Ministry of Directors last Monday .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the conditions of my investig@@ ative Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power , after the conversion , no sign @-@ cuts will take place and all the type @-@ relevant vehicle values will have unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in a business trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen offers the possibility that customers can come for example a half year after conversion , about with a motorbike in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in customer interest , it may be important to avoid any other damage , which at all have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , to avoid reli@@ ance on possible warranty claims , as it was .
therefore , VW is use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ran@@ see demands of rich austerity in future pro@@ pul@@ ses - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MEP Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their spar@@ ks pen@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugee banks money over night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ gu@@ ins .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euros on gyp@@ sum or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100 will cost 400 euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had been around 40 million Euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and which he could not fail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are in central bank account and also cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now to be put forward in accordance with the Princip@@ al Princip@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply leave in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four survi@@ vors , I would not like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have had understanding and are rarely on other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative Association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to carry you alone , &quot; business is permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or re@@ mitt@@ ances .
with pen@@ dic@@ tion@@ aries for deposits of three million Euros the Thur@@ in@@ gia and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay for deposits , this is a lot too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , at the T@@ eg@@ re@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is very abundant by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a small bank for a small bank if free money hat@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1911 , the cooperative @-@ founded Co@@ ve has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ re@@ see .
renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
the cooperative Association of Bavaria , &quot; currently no further banks are known , who calculate a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst .
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;

destination records : who actually purchases sound plates ?
lonely men middle ages love hard drives .
before comm@@ itting to the comm@@ ent@@ aries to over@@ l@@ ure him under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ sam@@ en@@ men with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ g@@ v , the complex development of sound plates is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who like to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely c@@ ab @-@ group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through Hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older records remains to spend their feelings more ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ g@@ v ?
if this blog would be a message report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o drives , a modest grey tra@@ ge and wild , before I stand ste@@ al , my hands hold , and slightly define man , like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart so@@ hos goes slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller have been located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by watching .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) into the Rec@@ ei@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle aged men , one woman , probably about the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I appreciate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have approximately 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
these Schall@@ platten , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford , when they appeared and buy objects that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ading .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70s , which was released , when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers who meet at You@@ g@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who will be influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and prompted to get back their old records .
by the conversations that I have led , people usually have been emp@@ tied to their collection in 1998 or in 1999 .
customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their plates , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to followers of a set of age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some disco@@ s @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ boards , from objects , the happy j@@ uri@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the fo@@ yer of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to get spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sol@@ ute a member of a flat stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who have one plate , do not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I bl@@ aded with a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy of the Re@@ vi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going to happen .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

French Court cap@@ es its offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court has rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais .
in a court proceedings this week ar@@ gues the authorities in Calais that the state should sell to 72 pro@@ visional businesses to sell , sell hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ fecture of Calais argued that these places should be cr@@ ested , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and the one lighter and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state supported Association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also resulted in the provisional shops and restaurants they often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a dish in L@@ ille decided that there is no legal basis for exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judges Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than those who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the low@@ lands , was the young Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des camp , which is operated as non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s razor must set itself on the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be over@@ com@@ bat@@ ly effective .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Show@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can for example be used at accidents points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway buil@@ ders or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples with does not often have the necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary Bl@@ itzer for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can however be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser technology allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as passage of the transit to time , stri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored .

great Britain took silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the Final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ aler stage .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , Re@@ pressing , scheduled flight and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist of any color .
the defeat was r@@ alled by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they pit@@ ched New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the Final .
but irrespective of it would have taken a 15 @-@ man team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ace for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite morning will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost at Ry@@ an every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop will do something , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and letting the attacks be GB@@ s from fun su@@ pr@@ es .
it felt for the Captain Tom Mitch@@ ell on and Co. , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners proce@@ eded 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with yet four minutes of game , Jerry Tu@@ wai is still going another attack from the right @-@ hand corner that he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball rolling .
a favor of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has only stopped fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute of J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner of a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ record and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still has da@@ ined .
so it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , what was good for relations of the first half time until Joshua ran through a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long for long in favor of the southern Bohemia , whose fans s@@ anders and d@@ anced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame performed the cake icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the pl@@ fi@@ ff crow@@ ned , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB k@@ ill@@ ful be@@ aten in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a ch@@ ap @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton collap@@ sed the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant tactics of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ 20 team , secured profit - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fighting with cancer of the trainer to a rowing victory
there will be no em@@ ot@@ less gold than with these games and that wants what is called .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go down in history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those two , who were in the board , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she was on the second Olympi@@ ad in two without a tax result , the first women in the history of the British sport that placed on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9,@@ ter is un@@ trained , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected the nature of the Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in ruin a batt@@ ali@@ on want to contribute to the incre@@ mental progression , which make up the difference and it was no one assistant than the trainer who would survive 30 months ago , whether he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said he is going to ris@@ ky .
I had blowing cancer , which is sacrific@@ ed and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere from .
it would have been a pretty sc@@ ant situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start to break the break to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I needed to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 walk , 50 foot to a time when they said that some steps were enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve fir@@ ing morning with a little more than usual to speak and thus tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an employment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
there are only repe@@ ating how much I and hero@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person to exercise or wish for a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning has not lost over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in the process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really is important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we did not come out to make some Tol@@ les .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take up for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer in Steve J@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that that was my last race .
it could have taken a lot of pressure .
in London it lasted for about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an ol@@ ymp@@ ic artist .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years pre @-@ exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association , &quot; R@@ asp@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring into the retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water manufacturers .
it meant that it was some time ago in the original in an article of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later would charge the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken to the special purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ most as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler stands for the 31 years in the special purpose association , 28 years as CEO .
at the age of 65 he was re@@ tired of retirement .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Broad@@ brunn , promotes an annual amount of 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 locations and hamlets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member groups are the communities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Baun@@ ach .
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current leader , broad@@ casts in Ger@@ tru@@ d sta@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was appointed as aqu@@ ac@@ ulture and was appointed managing director of the Ap@@ propri@@ ated Association already in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they cover from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational skills , budget@@ ing systems , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency positions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ stitu@@ tions of water lines .
there was no down@@ time and you have always recorded new additions because water life be@@ de@@ dly and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Go@@ ell@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has established himself with much passion for his water purpose and has been linked to the water@@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the track concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group to nit@@ rate coverage prior to the water@@ forum of the District under@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ nat@@ te Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons sem@@ olina , who worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
the highlights from his point of view he referred to the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the Rest@@ ruc@@ turing of the Ap@@ propri@@ ation of the Ap@@ propri@@ ated Association .
the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est use were the tube @-@ break@@ age in the flood with Kirch@@ lou@@ der on 3 January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain only because one filled the reservoir from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose federation was passed to Daniel Bl@@ mer out of lau@@ ter who ran the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

steel - Ligh@@ ting for German steel industry
the kr@@ atic @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million @-@ l @-@ height .
financial stresses , that of the industry from the oil promotion dro@@ ught , are of the table .
it abi@@ ding in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Re@@ placement in the production phase for so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ gi@@ issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really pleased that we were finally able to finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to use the steel manufacturer , the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from ho@@ cho@@ p to electricity generation for their own consumption , to request the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry fell into additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the C@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission for talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel units , all an EEG @-@ measurement of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ supply production .
thus the status quo of the existing regulation will be largely tigh@@ tly .
particular significance have the successful presence of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the reform of the E@@ TS , climate and employment targets are to be seen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe is suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis 2008 and a significant increase of price .
in the past year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer of China put in light on the world market in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand in China .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel con@@ fr@@ y price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
at the one hand , it im@@ printed in import steel and the other , the economic perspectives of China have risen in China .
unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp continued to be careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices would have st@@ agn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp largely did not want to exclude lock@@ ings of individual works .
in the German steel industry , there were around 8@@ 6,000 people in the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
it produced with 3,@@ 4 million tonnes of well six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the pre @-@ year @-@ t@@ as , as the economic association of steel dealt with on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced quantity went back in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is at least two percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with an increased output .
community , spirit , health : singing is sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was at school chor@@ us , in the teaching office , she occupied the compartment of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels well @-@ balanced , cheerful and a total of more lively , she says .
she is doing something very close to her health and her mind .
for singing is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Sen@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most elderly singers in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
for frequently they resolve social and family structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing sen@@ iors are a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demands his lungs , the daily life is not as fast as the puzzle too .
even when it comes to obtain the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Labour Community of the Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the common S@@ ingen had much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs with older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .

when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
concentr@@ ating on its own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers , that is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly , who live alone , practice not only on themselves focuss@@ ed on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I get long for something , I will get better and w@@ aking over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says , little talent to have , betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 singing men , who does hear , if a sound goes off ?
in search of the matching offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .

many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or to the church leader .
a lot of sen@@ iors also be found via the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to ask for help with the internet .

cats react sensitive to cr@@ ater on fri@@ ars of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ st@@ ling of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
to their surprise the mi@@ tig@@ ate left the males not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the irrit@@ ation of kittens from the mi@@ xes of the little ones .
they react around ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens that have been weak@@ ened in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ ver will also react to the ty@@ ards of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ tig@@ ate of less and strongly supported juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ H@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and sound @-@ height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their help is different .
a total of nine adult females and eight kittens have been observed out of the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
for those who were played by little children , who were taken off the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger ties , which were also lifted up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even the ones that had no own talent , re@@ acted , re@@ acted to the Schre@@ ie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned up fast to the loud@@ speaker , if this ru@@ fe has played the very sc@@ ant kittens .
this ability may be in@@ appropriate or develop with the sexual ri@@ pe .
&quot; one surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ine .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby baby .
also in doing so , some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ olog@@ ine Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ i@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ war@@ dly football @-@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver@@ r was issued an arrest warran@@ t .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey a major football game takes place .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ aic between sett@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as she has been said .
even in the im@@ position of an emergency condition after the overthrow in July , the government , the daily life of standardization should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which one is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , he will not stop at football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver@@ r the pro@@ secution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the sweet@@ ener is now being forced in America to be a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver@@ r shall be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible for the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
this applies first to 90 days of emergency condition until October , in fact , that has actually been as good as the life of the most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the closer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places across the country Erdo@@ gan is declared on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working @-@ club @-@ club @-@ club are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the gross of the Turks at the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
here even the fans agree - regardless of whether their heart is for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or settlements .
at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will especially arrive again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season with evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game @-@ time as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he generated the 1 : 0 @-@ winners .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in excellent ways and secured the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season for the record master an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the previous round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; differ@@ ed in the Europe League early .
in the sweet@@ ness it is only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master N@@ kt@@ as the game was running better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season entries as an Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ure bo@@ g@@ gling was the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
at the beginning of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez only had proclaimed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ es Fi@@ ber Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the falls would have to refrain , to reno@@ unce some third of its to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ one clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its content in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite intelligence : these athletes do still have medals chance at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice due to dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ - Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic is still definitely the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had initiated its start @-@ off immediately shortly before playing the games , was packed with their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ry scenario : with a warm smile she had still stum@@ bled into the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
when stuck , that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are many more athletes , who in spite of the doping past during the Olympic Games in Rio go to the start .
here &apos;s a summary :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the ol@@ ymp@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds , and is regarded as the biggest sp@@ er of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jama@@ ica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ as in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock , after having been proven the intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you have had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 have been tested positively to the robo@@ tic stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic riding the wis@@ s intake and was locked six months .
the four widest thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ours .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics , and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was established in 2010 positively and 21 months blocked .
a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible , bed@@ dable Mer@@ ge .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the biggest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ lete were detected as many medals .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone intelligence .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to provide Olympics @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone .
the Bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back to the International Criminal Court of Justice due to some extent of the International Sports Court .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , it is placed on rank 2 of the world cup .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km G@@ ehen , China ) : the World Teacher and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old World Cup , references to the intake of an em@@ bo@@ iled supplement was found , the locking of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell from and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Öster@@ rei@@ cher@@ in - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early .
she suffered many stuff and were treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
your home travel plans will be planned for beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ill@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is not yet unclear .
the State Department of the State stand in close contact with local authorities , such as bar@@ gaining .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok downtown Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday nights in a district of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police , the police have been killed here and approximately 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red , three Germans , three Netherlands and three Italians .
Friday morning again two spinning hang@@ ers went high , and according to the authorities another human being killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning a bom@@ bing is reported .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach P@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police authorities a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded a further bom@@ b that sle@@ w an urban environment .
according to the authorities in a floral garden , the war@@ eness was stopped in the air before the territory of the territorial Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations used in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ ill@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded .
one go out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bing @-@ att@@ acking is the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Military @-@ Major Dan@@ ai Oli@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ soon vor journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be too early to express themselves to potential motives - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks of bom@@ bing that is typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared the attacks not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems rather that the bom@@ bs of the opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have received adverse reference to pending attacks in the South of the country in recent days - unless they have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one thing is still unclear , which group behind the attacks .
the police took their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they usually do not turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the br@@ ush@@ y bom@@ bs , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities necessarily lead to .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) included in the province of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel to these provinces is not recommended .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) attached to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were performed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution by the military jun@@ ta .
this sp@@ acing that the military has a large influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs be an attempt to shor@@ ten chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the Mil@@ itä@@ run@@ ta who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeping himself good , the kingdom again led to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a handle in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed .
a year ago , in Bangkok , a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ank had been killed here in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is coming into the sight of the Federal Minister for constitutional protection .
after several national offices also the Constitutional shield as the group was placed under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspirations against the Free Democratic Basic Law , &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin .
thus , the emig@@ rants Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ly way .
therefore , we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of personal identity by means of transition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW and Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely coordinated with the national offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trying to derive their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , they are trying to address them with a you@@ less language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of the Islam@@ ists are as well as right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts .
this is not concrete advertising for the own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states there have been reports about contacts in the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate told , he did not find a knowledge .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species can be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who is extrem@@ ist , changing their target direction and so extrem@@ ist .
so , it is crucial that such individuals have a ste@@ aming influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase of un@@ lawful criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers , and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would still not speak of renewed terrorism in this connection .
but we have stated in recent years that there can be ri@@ ster@@ oid structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free group .
it may well be that other legal entities or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seekers , against Refu@@ ge@@ es or attacks from other extreme @-@ right moti@@ fs .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of rectangle but not recognizable .
the groups have now made up to date on a regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed themselves that many over@@ access to the account of people proce@@ eded that previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ suspected of attacks on asylum seekers have not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated , or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had previously started with right wing extremi@@ sts even politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , however , who have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right by far @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records , the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the coura@@ geous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly exagger@@ ated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was cut .
in the social networks he subsequently became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ended his prec@@ urs@@ or and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not his not an athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year old will take part at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming @-@ association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since in ae@@ edi@@ um most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name made the lap .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the whale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ stick &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was made with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meters Fre@@ est@@ yle , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s leadership is going to be dis@@ missed according to dis@@ mis@@ leading business
the Consu@@ l research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ pres@@ ences were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K had gu@@ essed that the chair of L@@ stand@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann , all the more uncertain , the longer the successes had promised .
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nürn@@ berger market research company Gf@@ K : after re@@ inde@@ ving business figures and the res@@ ign@@ ation of the company &apos;s management is the worldwide number five in the industry from a personal start @-@ up .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year .

he shall officially accept the function of a &quot; endor@@ sement , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann be found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted to name a company on Friday .
whoever will find the market research company in future , be still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ties it was on Friday , in the shareholders , at least the disappointment about the further lasting successes of the years initiated re@@ initiated re@@ organization .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case at BMW , that would like the Qu@@ and@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after decl@@ ines in the previous quarters , the company cannot stop its loss of loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent below the comparable level of the previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales exceed 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.@@ 4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter above all has affected the strong value of the company in the light of its difficult economic situation .
the Consumer Experience division made necessary for the Group &apos;s value @-@ reports of 139 million Euros of the Group , a loss of 14@@ 8,@@ 2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K had not generated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in cru@@ mm@@ ation in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
in an accident of a coach entry with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers guests have been in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hear@@ n ( county Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them .
the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to cover its data according to a opposite l@@ aster which was partly on the road railway .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus self @-@ independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ men liber@@ ated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ance wagons and an emergency @-@ car came to the down@@ fall on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers have been brought back by a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ cer@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ries and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of water will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of wast@@ ew@@ ater village of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Swimming Pool 3,@@ 44 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then increase if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a supp@@ er cal@@ culation , the wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported was found in the approval of the budget through the Land@@ scape with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for this wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment plant .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is due to its legal basis , the systems are free @-@ to @-@ operate .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial drives come from cat@@ chers , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the ag@@ it@@ ag@@ it@@ ages are between 48 and 67 percent .
as leadership of Herbert Schmidt to the Committee , was necessary for re @-@ calculation of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 the over@@ - or sub@@ covers resulting from the previous calculation period will be compens@@ ated .
the grave @-@ stir@@ en@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions un@@ founded Schmidt so that it is possible at all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the small distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have been aby@@ sm@@ al .
moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater is easily declined in all three systems .
furthermore , the termin@@ ology period at all three systems are not least due to their age and repair expenses on a significant circum@@ ference .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the world of space , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt dis@@ missed that in the se@@ wage system Al@@ endorf that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ head , the nearly 20 years of old convey@@ ing plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led and de@@ fle@@ dged after nearly 20 years in operation of the first fold @-@ piece , the pad provides an additional ventilation system to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water legal requirements even in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expendi@@ tures , the continued super@@ vis@@ ors and maintenance costs came into account according to the new package period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still clearly under the current level .
stone cottage made clear that during the small wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment in the last 20 years remained spar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue prec@@ arious after stone houses on the long run , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ continu@@ ance of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these plants , because it is concerned with sanitary facilities .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effects as Asian caric@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly towards breeds .
with its filter tool , there will be sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already has as absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are in@@ geni@@ ous , self @-@ effective tools , which generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fers per day .
all mis@@ steps will be transferred to the public domain .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of , that the App Black@@ face becomes shaped or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week a filter sh@@ aded a filter , which gave them Schl@@ itz@@ au@@ gen , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics as a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy sur@@ rendered to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after sn@@ ap@@ chat communicated that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced pedi@@ m@@ atism , rec@@ alled the filter to in@@ viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other refra@@ ined from the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et have been widely used across the photos that the filter is &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and w@@ rest@@ ling unpleasant was . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contra@@ sting of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted into the dispos@@ ed extremi@@ ties has been drawn .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural approaches .
American culture seems to be implic@@ ated in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are di@@ pped in matters as their older opponents - might seem to be expected to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s film creates a picture that is ins@@ ulting to a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to use Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineers for medium to extingu@@ ish their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , others to do the same .
in an attachment for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believe that r@@ ence @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the adjusting le@@ aks at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the partially part white , only male leadership and ended their set with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours , who work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or feel at home , in order to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat has been largely un@@ answered .
the company publishes no figures on diversity of its staff and points out to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there were Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently focused a personnel responsible person focused on under presented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to tell that that is not o.@@ k@@ . is . &quot;
military deployment of ISIS &apos; intelligence information , represents committee of Congress
military depend@@ ents of the United States Central Command changed revised information to draw an optimum picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual states on the ground were allowed , and an investigation committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute member , secret services , and the Wehr@@ macht , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction amongst the Central Command intelligence analy@@ st which reported how superi@@ ors changed their ratings to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military spending in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service , which were cancelled due to high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ bi re@@ treats regularly marked a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were integrated more positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leadership in Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed continuous problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
although there is no direct clu@@ es to the fact that government fac@@ tions have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ zing themselves exposed to pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented to the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com is publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of inquiries , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congress or@@ derer from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of the Central Command changed the im@@ pass@@ able reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life , after they were assigned to an@@ alysts got concerns about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings and will be continued during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Manager of Defence .
democratic members of the Message Board comm@@ enting on Thursday released their own findings , which coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of re@@ direc@@ tional assess@@ ments to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security Services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ day democr@@ at in the Kom@@ mit@@ ter , member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ tar@@ ded the publication of re@@ direc@@ tional reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the morality under an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats gave no clu@@ e to an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in the last August , the New York Times reported by the General Manager of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ d@@ r Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Department would not report any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversy in this important topic of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inquiries regarding the question of a successful air campaign led under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
but the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question , how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other economic regions .
the cri@@ tique of the secret information about the Islamic State will remind of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw in Iraq and little time to worry about the consequences of invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker has played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team focused on Mr. Hoo@@ ker , indicating government agencies to reject any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as this provisional refin@@ ing would have put in operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al comm@@ anders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lat@@ ure for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans was won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a thoughtful performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not belonging to the people who kept their gates in mind .
however , she knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are like in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ du@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals . the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place within their group .
the first place will move the strong Hol@@ ders a little longer out of the path that lead the other group .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising ancest@@ ral through their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time played a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a member of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as it could not qualify for the Catho@@ lics .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National team and thus began to turn the things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working order in London that we now have .
we have the Ru@@ g which can be carried out completely .
on Thursday morning B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and took the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
she finished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left f@@ lange , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball in the gate to get the US a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the shut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who has previously had to book a gate inside each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday .
amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of o@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late there is also , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and in@@ different , a rapid rel@@ ay of competition and pursuit .
it is as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning stack , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlon .
you cannot listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop when talking your neighbours , without more about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s sk@@ id with di@@ m@@ ples would certainly have been sent under these known names , built up to Prime Time , built by sponsors and charity TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ encer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ates any event .
further from the center , partially in the shade there are sports , which are not generally accepted : air@@ brush , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the ni@@ gh@@ ost , and let it be long reign .
but if I might make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me guide the attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has already been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 it was an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event than it had been in Sydney the last 16 years so pointed out that many people I asked , did not know that it is an ol@@ ymp@@ ic art .
this could be regional ignorance .
although the United States hop@@ ed for competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had one ath@@ lete to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain outer corner , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an enthusiastic enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never end wol@@ ves - but also the refinement of the gym and diving , the two sports which essentially uni@@ fies .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
jump winners on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to turn a number of falling movements ( rotating , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to the earliest Olympi@@ ad according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are compete in Rio against each other .
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the line or the power wall , but also of the television transmission , but also in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad of the ol@@ ines .
the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atics - and it is enough to make even a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I perceive even when looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ted , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back upwards .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ aults in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lift of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC is expanding the extension as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.00 .
among the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably ignored in general tumor .
if awareness increase only reaches through the anxiety and the lenses of male athletes can be achieved - as the male U.S. gymn@@ asts recently proposed by The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air rin@@ se , new fan base .
&quot; a Generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Prussian ally of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in Sch@@ or@@ um .
is Ethiopia especially to break together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government became the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week of thousands of people on the streets and requested fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot at zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
moving out videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how car@@ ers will hit young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country in and in future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in the remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new sequ@@ el in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sid@@ ents effective for silence .
many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
yet this could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Six@@ ty G@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous discomfort that cover everything from the ground use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of ruling coalition .
following a particularly critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border with Eritrea ; a struggle for this z@@ ag , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less forced in recent years to benefit the turbul@@ ence over and over again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of whom are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheap Smartphones were increasingly common and the internet services were improved .
even if the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter , which at regular intervals , especially in prot@@ rac@@ ers , many people still can communicate about internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they assembled themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons of prosp@@ eri@@ ans , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come predominantly Christian floods , in the politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are involved in coordinating with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader in the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a not the most publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was seen as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analy@@ st tell that he was particularly wast@@ ed in making early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian New Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Germany , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia has experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested against the government , which was apparently circul@@ ated by the government and subsequently stolen from the government .
during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and those days of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts in Ethiopia , leader of their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ sal of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
the last month of the demonstr@@ ators in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ i city , from Tig@@ ray @-@ owned shops and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more commonly practiced in the social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ e@@ aster on neighboring Somalia , even though they rus@@ hed to leave this base closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to collapse his allies in a already vol@@ ati@@ le region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gra@@ vit@@ walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp is explaining his claim Obama has been founded ... &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign that his multi @-@ repeated argument , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fying statement cast new questions about the communication skills of the Li@@ public@@ ans and public@@ ans whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public .
it also brings its collaborators , who make efforts to take him during an un@@ event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position of statements , which he could not meant at all .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday @-@ Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was returning to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposition to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to dimin@@ ish the statement by remember@@ ing that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , he wanted to know nothing of it .
the last storm of the cri@@ tique bo@@ unds upon Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic .
through Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons had proposals to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism of himself when he said the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but later he explained &quot; Natural &quot; I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then call on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp announced another sound , because its demand trend continues to go back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics frequently , his statements to dist@@ ort or his hum@@ our false . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while he is reinforced by the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the in@@ comfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called her back@@ wards , completely wrong and therefore it came to pass , because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as foreign minister , it ISIS allowed to spread themselves , by raising the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to ride out on each of his words and to be bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he infl@@ ated the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Democrats asked about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s F@@ ap@@ ology as only an additional evidence that it is in@@ appropriate for the Russian Federation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once passed over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by cafe in Williamsburg , in which you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front was forced .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced the b in the summer of 2014 , sold so@@ ap in the shape of C@@ up@@ cakes .
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a ri@@ val@@ ing city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ she wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel , and Ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap store . &quot;
but if New York Change is , then it is also new @-@ finding .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original site .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employees of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained much more .
verb uses the same distributor for excav@@ ators bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ rison like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural re@@ inde@@ ls .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a constant current of old master customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old clients were also driven by prices in Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was one of those customers .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lives earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way on himself .
after having closed the verb , she gave a while the coffee ham , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she liked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drinks coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea ordered this day instead of their usual Coff@@ ee@@ Coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket , and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he will change his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he won &apos;t take a gro@@ ll about that the so@@ ap @-@ shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie also offered a special so@@ ap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have accepted the café as well .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he proposes to put them out soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has additional advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill in the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café will expand into a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb extends to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph WIT@@ T was root and said that he was destroyed by the ground than the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ rec@@ t that the con@@ front of the Lok@@ as and the Order had a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; I had to sm@@ elled , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin DE@@ LA@@ NO Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtles .
its menu on this day was something modest : cor@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histor@@ ies .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while pulling in their book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; on life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving Im@@ bite in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in the store since the stock market in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses made with olive @-@ pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn ate with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and vegetable mixing .
when the re@@ porter was ordered , this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was Erd@@ wal@@ nut , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something tri@@ lli@@ on which acc@@ esses the ingredient .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put themselves in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ded for male field processors and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans , who sent a semi @-@ hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square ) &quot; draws the ways with which the country turned to be no longer the sh@@ ear @-@ weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new Bud@@ di@@ ous : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len have become stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; realised brick , as coo@@ ks ru@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients could hide under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry dr@@ y@@ st .
meat , which was the centre of American food for years , became a rare luxury .
peculi@@ ar mixtures were tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ished satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since then , the House@@ hold @-@ contractors , including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as .
by providing the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget@@ ary policy &quot; and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of the historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the response from the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in his kitchen , he looks like the millions of millions of world to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ ign@@ ity .
President Roosev@@ elt perhaps would have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ure a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the te@@ di@@ est food in Washington , but also one of those performed . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the country came back to the legs .
the Legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the pair dealt with when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s son @-@ in @-@ law had better understood - for example , how they could not throw food .
&quot; it had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ ra@@ inf@@ estation .
after the plates were cleared from Eisen@@ berg &apos;s they went away and co@@ e a dessert that they had home at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosev@@ elt was for lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and she added that it was a commonly practiced trick , to miss a name to be missed .
there was no s@@ laugh@@ ing cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
everyone sh@@ out a bit of rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a discount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he caught everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died in a cl@@ a@@ erial attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ met &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , who saved his life according to the image newspaper almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians , that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a child from the w@@ ning of a house , going 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the brigh@@ ter symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Her@@ oes he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am dying to save life , I think God gives me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself had an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicopter have four facade bom@@ bs over the Alzheimer adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the boat ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie first got up with 150 years of offspring .
on the ground of the North Atlantic ocean , the Gr@@ ön@@ shar@@ k located on the ground of the North Atlantic Ocean , at an hour it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 metres .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this peak speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this kind of slow@@ ed lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported on scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; at least one of Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland are st@@ ony .
only fail the evidence .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , eventually they live primarily in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sv@@ alb@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees c@@ enti@@ grade , they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter .
on the way of life of Greenland researchers , researchers know accordingly little .
their time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ m measures pointed out when they over@@ looked six animals with a transmitter .
loot make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a animal researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw @-@ bones of a young polar bear .
possibly they chase for sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of Eis@@ me@@ eres and seek Kad@@ aver , which from higher aqu@@ ariums in the bottom tor@@ angles .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as a con@@ gest@@ ing of the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 5@@ 02 centimeters in size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the line@@ age of shar@@ ks .
this center of the ey@@ lin@@ se is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins included in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon is in@@ duced in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ timet@@ res length third @-@ smallest animal , the l@@ ors on the other hand has a low over@@ shot on carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had in their ruler to contrast normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cm long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai an age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years old may be .
that Gr@@ ön@@ hai females only got offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers of the length could be assigned to an old age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters at ease at the threshold of the sexual readiness and his age was determined at 156 years , Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a centuries of time .
also this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ os live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
even the previous record @-@ ke@@ eper , a 211 @-@ year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ wal , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , a 120 year old hard@@ ship lace , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there is often the organism of the animals living there .
so they mature later - and then slower .
to keep warm in cold water the animals are often particularly big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal leaves heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than a grams of elephant .
a further advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very large animal was supposed to invest his resources into a long life .
construction grounds at a double pack
with issues relating to Bau@@ en has focused on the recent session in the most recent meeting .
with relief the committee took the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger living areas can begin . &quot;
after the real estate , Par@@ cel@@ ue - and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the requests for measurement can be clari@@ fied , the sale of the land in the residential areas &quot; road path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way .
the par@@ ch@@ at is convinced that the streams known in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and ru@@ di@@ ous sen@@ iors alike .
as it was , Bau@@ te@@ ers can report immediately in the town hall , about the allocation of the plots will probably be advised in its September session .
in order to also request further inquiries regarding the settlement of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , decided to change the council at the beginning of this year a newly created surface plan in sub @-@ areas .
so in the area of Sub@@ time lar@@ n the commercial area is already expanded by two par@@ c@@ els towards the road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main came to compete with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg - the best opportunities for reloc@@ ated to London and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence of competence and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , they have so far enough for approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just a big US @-@ banks .
multiple banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ance of the Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects to deal with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main for five years .
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area are united , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance survey EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a large fund business , but also cuts to the infrastructure as well as in Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore the town with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .

&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could withdraw further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton concluded on Friday her tax return for 2015 , this y@@ iel@@ ded a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax revenue of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % on Friday .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 Million employed for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had generated an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on the State Department .
Clin@@ m &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his controllers over the past ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards concerning financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri , in an opinion well @-@ known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a case , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind false phrases and retreat in relation to his previous promises to release his controllers .
it is common for US presidential data to publish their controllers , even though they are not obligated by law because of this .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have as reason for his refuse to report a tax check by tax authorities .
&quot; you are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons campaigns in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the release of the Presidential candidates of the Democratic Party .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he will not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before tax testing is not closed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things Also the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that its ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its divisions and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking re@@ public@@ ans Tru@@ mp call for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a talk on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do that which has done every other presidential did@@ acy in the last decades and to publish their controllers . &quot; she said to the crowd .
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid for two years not or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax advice , the information that this could still be the case .
Federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax set of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industries has called its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to a meeting in order to exchange their control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ alo said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had been subjected to a tax check of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has issued tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal rate of approximately 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of their income emerged as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
its main reason was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ ds divi@@ den@@ ds divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

Jewish director dec@@ ayed Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; solic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ paved a media watch , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , since there would have been Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of hotels .
but the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel over its own call center .
after a declaration , the director turned to the Hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shock him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employees said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that was behind it , sol@@ ves in the film@@ maker even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee being cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambass@@ ador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das trading that was called a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the South German newspaper .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled from this event .
this is indeed very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has worn in Germany at exactly this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident sol@@ dered a pretty big resonance on the internet , in which the people sc@@ andal the whole sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been abandoned to the alleged local needs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in another article that pointed out that the hotel is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly pointed all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident to be a &quot; understanding &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , tells the mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quick electoral list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; held the South German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
the lifting of the sanctions was growing according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading division between Moscow and Teheran in the annual comparison by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , the ambass@@ ador with them .
Russian companies involve existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade fair is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading division between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 growth and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the commercial break was reached by deliveries of machinery , vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambass@@ adors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back to Russia for this year by a record of Iranian tourists .
last year the Russian foreign representatives attended about 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily for travel to Iranian people .
furthermore , Iran reached the Top 20 countries which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something , from which the ambass@@ ador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend the visit to the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses looked for : drink at the Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack is practi@@ sed on Thursday morning at the beverage market of RE@@ WE XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
taking pre@@ ach of a sh@@ utter weapon demanded three dark @-@ cl@@ ed persons , who had covered their faces , from the employee of the beverage market , the sp@@ elling of cash and then pres@@ um@@ ably at first by foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money is exploited , the police do not share with .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the Park@@ deck of the RE@@ WE market and is therefore bad in sight .
the perpetr@@ ators must be banned in direction to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Path and covered from that opposite the parking @-@ car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who has made a break ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack is urgent to get in with the police .

in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ eries of all Mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage goals have been checked and finally decided finally for the Bish@@ ops of Freiburg where this year at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the there@@ opened door of Mer@@ cy , was offered a special pilgri@@ m excursion .

S@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in Rio to glory , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the roll @-@ roll that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had committed himself . the young and made the legend as he was stor@@ med home to win a victory from the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England was claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics .
she reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the train World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the younger Jamie Staff .
you did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys re@@ tired generated a gap , which tried to close the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who had four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ eves - and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fication round a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ alone program captured the Zeal@@ ots in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with Gold .
he was going back after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation which was driving in a higher course in order to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have put a Olympics in the ends , and the World Champion was defeated .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys he added to that he dropped off after a weak start .
he moved back this statement later and there was no objection from England &apos;s Riv@@ alen .
it was not such a problem with such a super@@ vis@@ ing victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB of flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible in the area of Pos@@ sible that he reiter@@ ated the victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yields of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of the Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the Sprint today starting and going over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels some lon@@ es@@ ome to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ja Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 in the target .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22 / 22 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ lu@@ gins will be safety in focus .
he had taken up yesterday with representative before the qualification as he called to judge his body size .
relative to the Women &apos;s Competition , which will be continued and termin@@ ated , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team is leaving his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sn@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio have been down .
he plays drama in the background so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism - and bullying and reti@@ ring of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
but if one sees itself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , as the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment to its climax again to be repeated again .
the future of the melt from Port@@ land , due to the abolition of the energy order
the future of aluminum mel@@ t@@ acks of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , as the plant operators declare the energy supply contract , and thus lift all delivery agreements , as the supplier energy companies communicate .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one for 20 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ ject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will run in November . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand in the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to predomin@@ ance effects , as the mel@@ ting up around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point of Henry mel@@ zer@@ y , which led last year to a closing of the fro@@ g power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in respect of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price of the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ ating with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with that it eman@@ ates that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the multilingual ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp will hold smaller percent@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the company with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup business@@ man &quot; shall have to come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the power supply was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong stock markets for major retail prices .
AG@@ L shared that the value of the contracts is already written in the amount of $ 187 million in an anticip@@ ation of cancellation .

more than just one Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV , Kendall is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ths of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ lady and mother of the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ an Kr@@ is is on the Cover from the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ship of the US Vo@@ gue .
Leon , the brand ambass@@ ador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to crying . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers has followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ( with the exception of the problem cases ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ch ) and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party .
this provides the cl@@ isch@@ ee@@ ant action nearly every birthday of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ achi brought the sentence , &quot; you covered that we had forgotten ? &apos; , with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take their other girls to take part in this publicity .
with a view to the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ths of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes them , as for the Vo@@ gue cover , they ( and her husband Can@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a League for itself .
the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ram is for Vo@@ gue the most sought after issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which is more similar to an image band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were created by the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be nar@@ row@@ ful that in the last two years the magazine of the magazine were logged before the official announcement .
women who were already in the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambass@@ ador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 in the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - who is described from the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ al model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under the former category falls , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today , who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ sen ) .
they are really talented women who are interested in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last Cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like to succeed .
with their reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the secret Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and their colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called it &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ pieces of Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings co@@ vert back much when the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the melanch@@ ol@@ y it seems to pass at the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September @-@ edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell them from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells photos of C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time it is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers show 80@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the local aid in the country are re@@ marked by the council centres , while the sector has on the effects of further central abbrevi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y people , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just delay and those who have no means of un@@ just legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , who are already over@@ ly bored , make themselves ready for further cuts .
starting June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their Federation .
the director of the community centre of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community reference centers sur@@ rendered that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ si said that the situation would only be worse without a cancellation of the decision of the German government .
&quot; que@@ lands community centers are chronic , which means that thousands of people are of important services that you need , rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ able and impressive debts , families who were released through separation , workers who were dis@@ coura@@ geous - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of aid people from Queensland to be forced out of Queensland , with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call on the General Office and Federal Minister of Justice and the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to delay these medi@@ ations , so that people may need the help they need to preserve on legal problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year the state government fulfilled its commitment , means for legal assistance to the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities as well as to ensure that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U
with the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
this was representative @-@ representative surveys of the European Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in North are just under further rule , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin .
in both of the federal states , the SPD , however , would have the strongest party and therefore could have good chances to continue to face the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD won the SPD of 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent more than five years ago at 24 percent .
the party def@@ ends the party just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left of the left for 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Mand@@ D would be present at 19 percent first in the country of land .
in spite of mild losses , despite easy losses , with 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present at 3 percent in the country of the country .
in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the pol@@ l came up according to 23 percent ( choice of 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time at the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss on the other against 2011 as opposed to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers today dominate the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in storage was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fers with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices in the internet , but they are somehow come from the quar@@ ry of the dormitory .
however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Computer CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ al format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if agon@@ izing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded to like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
quite proud , the price is : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany lay in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could get in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile saving of the Finn@@ s experienced a un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was finally sold and handled on Microsoft .
the market now dominate the provider that all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphones of smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple were sold by alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless App @-@ providers and the t@@ elec@@ om industry .
all around the smartphone has now developed a whole industry .
the key breakthrough to the mass market occurred only in early 2007 , then Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the I@@ ph@@ ones .
he spoke three instruments in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , everything by touch screen easy to use .
the triumph of Apple began , nor today is the iPhone the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry that dominated the market had the follow @-@ up .
they disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian provider like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a matter of course .
on the inc@@ ision , every Deutsche Welle is now 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put away the smartphone also sometimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Siemens Board of Management for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent en@@ fe@@ asi@@ bility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the ol@@ ymp@@ ic mind and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only take place in our local communities and in all of London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we operated a great deal of effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will come again by creating new possibilities for local people , and companies in the vicinity of He@@ a@@ throw @-@ create new possibilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will alone already provide 10,000 new apprentic@@ es , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and will prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large .
I was told that England never will be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over@@ winds , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual a infra@@ structural project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ able growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to T@@ 2 , which was built among the two frequented wings of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion by private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw is also one .
it is time that we ste@@ er this ol@@ ymp@@ ic mind and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad block
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online selling money come according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ block display block , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there would block display lo@@ tion on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it hur@@ ried that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the co@@ ding regarding his advertisements in order to detect it display lo@@ osen the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to detect .
but ad@@ mitt@@ edly announced that there has been a new way to b@@ yp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post wrote the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er &apos;s struggle between the For@@ giving Open Source Community and the rout@@ ing has already been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon arrive with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left its struggle for social media , is a strong indicator of how worrying ad lo@@ osen for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study , from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people use advertising @-@ loos@@ er ; nearly four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active users , who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand @-@ friction 84 per cent of the ads make Fac@@ ebooks from .
the company has advertis@@ ed it on display block on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block , does not have any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram distributed a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs is a sufficient amount of revenue such as Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that it would be updated to update more control over them to get more control over them .
on Thursday I claimed Facebook that Ad@@ Block would be worrying about new filters because they are also blocking content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; for users this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , told a spokes@@ person from Facebook in an email communication .
advertis@@ ers , are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control in the hands of the people .
pregnant woman in thought @-@ su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was ab@@ rupt from several vehicles on a highway on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said .
it &apos;s obvious that a Swiss died at the age of 49 , surrounded by several vehicles , including a load , even to kill itself .
it died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified yet , the police , whom these as well as any witness of the incident to report .
it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter des Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person running in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night will run as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent killing has been acqu@@ itted after having survived a man and killed in August 2014 of one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has been unconscious on the road , took judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the court said that the pol@@ ishing -- who had responded to an emergency - in a justified way -- and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information to the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once habit@@ able
the Venus was probably inhabited by the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells most likely .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , which resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere would once have taken over @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus would have a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere could have had and yet slowly revers@@ ed .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect life from faster am@@ orous .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 per cent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model sim@@ ulates the slow rotation of Venus its daily side of the sun nearly two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun warmer .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees of cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought of planetary research .
although they were formerly inhabited , Venus -- exposed to much heat and ultra @-@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
her Oc@@ eans are dar@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen Sand@@ wich only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - the Venus that we know about it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Ke@@ pler measures the rotation of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ads
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space @-@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ y to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star Ple@@ j@@ ads .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the cluster loops are rotating in different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope we see through the same of our results with other star@@ fish , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star gate of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster arose before around 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult .

if a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .

a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star step up
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional response announcement , the 41 year old professional on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will last the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos;s , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player of the league , 2009 he won with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a tenth of the year issued him a year 27 million US dollars every year .
until the end of the Con@@ tract on 31 December 2017 , he works in the future as consultants and youth coach - in full content .
as players paid there Rodri@@ gu@@ ez long time with performance back .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to have some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two further bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
however , to the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be absorbed .
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched between 2001 and 2003 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked in due to a winding in the so @-@ called bio @-@ Genesis sc@@ andal by end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered as the main susp@@ icious one for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida to have received funding .
after a dispute the lock was also reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 as I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then southeast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not go straight .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received even the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .

Olympic 2016 : ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first Dop@@ ing@@ accidents
caught : for a positive rate of dop@@ amine , weights for Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio did not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games in 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ amine .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete could have won almost a medal .
in front of the seventh competition the first official dop@@ ing@@ cases the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions come these messages to the unknown .
in Ch@@ en , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven that has been used as a mas@@ king tool for dop@@ amine items .
the International Sports Court CAS confirm the Friday afternoon after the exp@@ ulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final about 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the Bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pro@@ ving over 50 m of Fre@@ est@@ yle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B sample and an hearing requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demanded of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court Security Council and accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C but the CAS for the disinfection of the sports@@ men with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news noti@@ fies the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act at the Forbidden substance around the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Test was also positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately applied with criticism in the ath@@ lete &apos;s word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete did not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weight of weights from the chron@@ ically offering @-@ hard nation do not take part in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; is well @-@ known , the London @-@ Olympics in class until 85 kg was tested just like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both disp@@ ose of intake , both of them should not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another difficult blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the world @-@ association IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team up to an exception for systematic Dop@@ ings the start , even the fer@@ nation of Kenya produced numerous poor news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sports the earlier verses in China also had taken care of fi@@ erce conflicts between the athletes .
so gri@@ ps the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympic Capital Sun Yang har@@ p .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium at 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle , I want to pass on , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio .
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for the doping &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships positively to the stimulation of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ k@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ackers your ran@@ som
programmers from con@@ press@@ ors are currently focusing on companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware accounting specialists of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , United Kingdom and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with compres@@ sor software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing .
40 percent of the victims paid to the victims requested by the perpetr@@ ators demanded to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators specialize their re@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the artists were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the cul@@ pr@@ it software for itself .
first , however , private users were the target , but the transition to company att@@ acken took place during the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they search for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives files and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
afterwards the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ch@@ ser .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ tow@@ ish bit@@ coin .
however , where private users use the personal photo database in the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which increases production .
accordingly , higher the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware beat .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales shar@@ ehol@@ ding through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had even had to do business completely , in case there were people in life @-@ danger .
in Germany , many hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you thereby promotes only the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Cas@@ lec@@ tic Pole . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the light of stal@@ em@@ ate .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure gives the usability surfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
you declare their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access @-@ to @-@ date support websites or de@@ code for free example .
and are to redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred tonnes , companies have to pay partly tough and five digits to return their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing , the h@@ acker will always be more professional and share the work , explains security professionals , Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
probable is it possible for three or four persons .
the programmers sell their damages then in the form of a software construction of the actual ground@@ work .
the past Mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the v@@ presses are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a criminal and instru@@ cts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per authorised machine .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then carry sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies active companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be dra@@ fted by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful recognition , the perpetr@@ ators are calling up with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential for damage , depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before .
the perpetr@@ ators in future could now take completely new goals in the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con illustrated safety researchers , such as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control over the Internet .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a block @-@ controlled heating could certainly be a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block all production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
it sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is something off .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a suit@@ case of 4@@ 53 l with high @-@ issued and 10@@ 26 l back @-@ out back @-@ back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can be high up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and provide storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.9 m high .
the trunk of the trunk can be loaded well , but charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in ranges of ranges very powerful .
he looks at his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
pleasing is the everyday use of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there are another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 l @-@ gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment is shown in the top @-@ variant &quot; executive &quot; not wishes .
for the safety systems the City @-@ Emer@@ gency driver assistant ( works up to the speed 32 ) , the col@@ l@@ isions @-@ system and the Sp@@ ur@@ hal@@ te@@ assist@@ ent .

the full connectivity is available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top diesel are fine .
if you do not want to invest so much , the gasoline will receive from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the motors meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .

Airline is not held : overthrow on the passenger bridge
an Airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only in dangers that are typical of the air@@ freight , argued the upper court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been broken with the fall of a knee br@@ ace .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to not pay damages to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
accompanied by holi@@ day@@ makers after their journey only money back if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt to be found in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests are er@@ ased to show the same symptoms .
in the un@@ treated case , a family was hard to break into diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their door .
they spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective cl@@ ave , which was supposed to be poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was so lacking - and lod@@ ged against the organis@@ er .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ers had no success .
although the law@@ suit was broken in fact .
but the organizer took only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ers thereof .
he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was in order .
so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
especially as in the rehear@@ sals of the water were not found contamination .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens with one another - belonging to each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
on 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 guests .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concerns about further attacks .
the state must be occupied and determined at the same time the terrorist acts .
it is certain that our country will not answer the perpetr@@ ators of perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split .
this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists .
if we had to leave perpetr@@ ators faster the country , incre@@ ment the security and strength also the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the EP elections in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personalized rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ channel size over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ises for terrorism must be back under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon of arms is to be regulated so that the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated .
the least deb@@ ated secrecy for physicians to remain preserved after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , he wants to seek in dialogue with the doctors who could reduce the haz@@ ards of citizens , as the haz@@ ard of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of intelligence .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister expressed himself clearly against shareholders .
&quot; this was a ear for the hin@@ ge in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the radio group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected a ban from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of the commission is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
one can not for@@ bid everything that one re@@ jects and I rest the trailer of the Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules about road traffic or witness to court .
green Princip@@ al in Simone Peter threw the Minister from , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages , in@@ action and vi@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ Part@@ ori@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et Sp@@ ru@@ che and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the residence right bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway
it looked on a regular basis on the rotation road - here a picture of November .
however , this should change : the judicial de@@ fle@@ ur should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers that stop in the professional traffic on the ambient street every night in St@@ au , if they drive over the highway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the city &apos;s street building extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the downhill Wes@@ eler road the right @-@ bi@@ eger@@ by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer road on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early , thus improving the operations on the diverse sections of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ enster @-@ West district .
the tram stop on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the mot@@ orists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the return road reaches back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ wer path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ til@@ ation at the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler road .
from here traffic is only diver@@ ted via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge does not have the required S.@@ W.@@ L. to record mainly the heavy traffic @-@ rate bil@@ ing@@ ual .
how long will this Eng@@ pass and the associated table of traffic will not say , the official state of the government can not say .
however , is expected to calculate with many years : the bridge has an official balance of resi@@ due up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bi@@ e@@ tiqu@@ ette , the provincial service has deliberately been chosen in the school holidays because with disabilities is to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday at the job@@ site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater is now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association offers young people with a migration and a refugee @-@ background , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre of Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; visited 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and a refugee attitude to the goal , schools with welcome classes , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster , within the framework of this project .
most of the youth in the class be between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and has been little German .
thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ zen@@ ische images and video animations , it may have been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Christ@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from Spra@@ ying , and the boy Theatre may work together within the upcoming season as part of a musical the@@ atri@@ cal project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years receive the opportunity to visit professionally instru@@ ctors in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language courses are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increasing refugee camps , the association expects many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope in weather forecast
the weather has made the star @-@ lad@@ le Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a St@@ rich through the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night was well suited for clouds and rain , to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will definitely see lots of star@@ ters in the sky .
with the star@@ ters it is per@@ si@@ z@@ den , which belong to the fastest star@@ ters with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you sit around etern@@ ally , at night they lie around for hours , in the morning there is nothing more to think about sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , it is possible with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adult male disease and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently recover .
how do you hear sleep problems or sle@@ ep@@ tive disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes underlying , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ gener , board member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ forschung and Sle@@ ep .
what one can see among them is the In@@ som@@ nie , that is an entrance and a sle@@ y disorder .
just this can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member in the German House@@ hold Association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what is behind sle@@ ep@@ tive disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it may be organic , psychological or mis@@ conditional factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early warning is common especially on depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that several factors conduct each other .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , watches all two to three hours and begins bl@@ ur@@ ry to p@@ onder@@ ing about all @-@ day problems and worry , there is mol@@ ding an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one be with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
anyone who is not well sleeps about a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor betra@@ y We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is dis@@ missed , we@@ ary , uncomfortable , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has vo@@ icing fluctu@@ ations or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the de@@ composition , it is important to find out their causes .
one treatment options include such behaviour changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tab@@ let@@ ts only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
down@@ ward sleeping sickness is made in Germany barely , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary &amp; Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should first turn to sleep @-@ problems first to the car@@ in@@ arian , he@@ aters We@@ aters .
it can clear with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should sleep in bed , and what happens there ?
for examining in child labour , it is possible for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , in case of disease cases , in case of sleep w@@ ron@@ e@@ iness or if one does not find the cause of a master @-@ stor@@ ks , explains Fi@@ etze .
you do not need to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not take a mid@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after bon@@ ding one goes to his normal time in bed .
beside the electrodes in the body there is a nose @-@ envel@@ ope , a chest strap and a tor@@ ch at the finger .
additionally , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping .
how can fraud get the problems get a handle ?
there are quite a lot of pay@@ ers where you can bet for a better sleep .
We@@ eks count on : regular bed@@ time and lifts , not too long in bed , not to sleep in bed , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night not look at the clock - then one starts out immediately , and that is quite and not beneficial .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V @-@ teams in the UK .
in December 2014 , he took the first German World Championships in Doha in Doha at the same time and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been instru@@ mental in the criticism of the ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country in which an ol@@ ymp@@ eger 20,000 € award gets and a jungle of 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sports is poor , the dop@@ ing@@ checks are very good .
this means that we can not compete with countries that promote a lot and are not as closely related to the theme or do it even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he had to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch by the National Anti @-@ doping agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) .
exactly in this way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled a certain period before the World Cup / OS by independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of W@@ ada / F@@ ina , may not take part , &quot; the Ele@@ ction of Hamburg , who meanwhile runs a ice cream .
airport : ban@@ kers away from Bag@@ ging Bag@@ ging
professional ho@@ ist@@ ers at Düsseldorf Airport
civil servant of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police took on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had also be used as Ban@@ de several pick@@ ups and bags .
against 21.@@ 30 pm , civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy who was known to the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences in the middle of July this year and were thus a collaborative , complicated and highly professional .
the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can follow the di@@ eben that had come to Germany to protect crimes , from off@@ ences to Germany , to prove four acts .
here they had a total of over 15@@ ,000 Euros of exploited .
Alt@@ es , a few lenses , some lef@@ tist streets away : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in works at first glance , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks down the road from east to west , one passes on playing places , a fresh@@ water kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house someone has ugly ! &quot; spec@@ tively . &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl who is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new studio apartments .
articles about this &quot; trendy area , &quot; as the responsible property firm Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in , are however preferred in recent weeks however preferably with burning cars .
the ground is the house with the number 94 : once it occupied , meanwhile , the residents have rented ten@@ ants , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year the Berlin indoor H@@ enkel plant had been a decisive action against the police in the beginning of the year , called the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22nd June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police statements , the police had three weeks official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the ground , dry parts of the street and kept the visitors from that house with the number 94 .
meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the un@@ known land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and building workers went under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves forward .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer lives in the p@@ ines since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , which draws three children here , especially from the police presence of gener@@ a .
with the inhabitants of the house@@ projects they share the concern about rising ten@@ ants and G@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a p@@ ines who wish to make a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between the hom@@ eb@@ re@@ members and their neighbours to open , does not exist as evi@@ dently .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which today compared to the rest of the city , a lower average and risk of poverty .
also home network and the born dwelling projects belong long to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street near the town centre .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under the big law battle , many of the projects in the town of Riga were occupied and are still inhabited by the people nowadays who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district of the last few years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and election lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them all inhabitants of GDR @-@ times and former hom@@ eb@@ re@@ er gathered their p@@ ines .
this makes things noticeable also in the rental , which has risen almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the re@@ constructions in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them by sli@@ pped disks or newly created fac@@ ades , which were rejected with shades .
no other street was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours could see that as problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury , statistics , according to polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make inci@@ dents that tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years , next to the controversial 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
as for non @-@ violence , it is cri@@ tique : people in the 94 are their neighbors , which they certainly not have been .
even the famous burning cars give it no longer to the town of Riga anymore .
for the studied Archit@@ ect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the rig @-@ headed street - and stayed there .
therefore it was also important that people get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighbourhood .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants of the inhabitants , the road will continue to take away : with sigh@@ ted new buildings in former buildings , which thr@@ ong the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are not very con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well be@@ wil@@ ful , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do , if you never listen to someone ?
here , there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the occup@@ ants .
for shelter resulting from col@@ os@@ bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house@@ projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
who attracts , should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub , to complain about noise there .
all persons asked only with first names are asked to do not be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
furthermore she is social worker on the ground .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee agent for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gues supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , working and refugee assistance , administr@@ ations , authorities , and who else fails .
Reg@@ ine Client of the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the cur@@ ative Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which primarily has a problem .
as a consequence , some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly than on the multitude of desired tasks would be pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful - as the administration wanted to write down the place .
looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , joined by many years of experience in the field of social work , just a variety of experience .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all it is about organization , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le honest and full @-@ time actors support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the washing road
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting people who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you need to place refugees in own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must take the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ ory to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
it has been a very difficult quest for some time now .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work so far , unless you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , most of the apartments must be visited as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed B@@ lei@@ be , there are traine@@ eship , training places , school courts , A @-@ Euro Jobs and help activity for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master work , do @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive effect .
that was &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean just work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a degree of national .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here management and volunteers are also taking place .
it is central that refugees get the feeling that they were welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make it sensible to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , that will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are also , says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people at which nothing is about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is all already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces are fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher may call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; an resi@@ dual risk could and wants to close it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed be the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into recall .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus the main and volunteers need to stop in the region and in the region according to its activities .
they always have the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß in refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question clearly to answer , do not shy the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on the ground .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
regul@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher would have already been se@@ ast@@ ed to integrate the present human beings .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , one should need to help them both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complex , there are no simple answers .
Schorn@@ dorf : intru@@ der with helicopter for
the police helicopter flew approximately one hour for several areas - in@@ effective .
two unknown men are over@@ loaded at the Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the people surprised the two and attacked the b@@ hol@@ den in the run .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ cot , they bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black chap@@ els pul@@ ses .
they planted in the direction of downtown .
in the way the police conducted several poles and a police helicopter .
the deser@@ tification was carried out without success .
perhaps the unknown was indeed close to the apartment or during their escape .
