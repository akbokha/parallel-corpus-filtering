<seg id="2">"" "invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - this is both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential election are however in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt more small in doubt and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and adjust to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand would be completely different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively withdraw regulations and it makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "Clinton said:" "" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged chances and need money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost wordless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly outrejected by the state-critical teammy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "so there are still partial discussions on trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wishes to build coal fired power plants and re-drive the carbon promotion in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to denounce the Paris mitigation agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton is aiming to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the trance-trade agreements, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the US by international trade - but simply American jobs are better protected.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those should then be paid better then calls for instance Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rackdown, then he says, he could not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizen to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so that the budget deficit would be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least want to demand from the rich rich, that they pay more taxes and whose critics say, more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they anchored in Germany, told Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external specialists"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands to their hands and to preach an official end to the last eight months of war in terms of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin got his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot express myself that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the envelope, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin attooed smiled smallis and he hardly radiated warmth, even for its back-keeping circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, he repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but they will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard that if there would never be anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite rather than the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of the bezzling, sustainable cooling showed that the head of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first one which he mentioned in his introductory lecture: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to time was burnt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told and accused Ankara, Russia to be in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even greater, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cousins will rebuild itself becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the nationally controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious, the accusations of leading officials from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have benefited by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has done this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message heard that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology of the President Erdogan, whom he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month with a coup d "état was on the top of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are taken back.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecasts the state of the state of television for cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti imagined it as follows: "tourists staying there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it was reaction to the tried of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the ongoing Groll is coming over the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pipious to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty for ensuring that he was asked for the elected state of state support for the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow, a matter of course that has even changed a deep-seated fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this gglittering palace made available to Russia and Turkey, one as it once said to me an analysts, "Alliance of Foreign Affairs,": two countries that are chased by the West and were poorly examined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support antagonistic sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talk, both the President during the press conference said that they had not even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey forbid it purposely to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disparaster, NATO's member Turkey was struggling to combat the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talking to one another.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now that we do not pursue a global goal, but to pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely, and our employees will work among these trademarks.</seg>

<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrowest of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged the dismissal of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who since 2012 was Ivanovs deputy, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is called (in Russian) that it was later referred to as the manager and administrative manager of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin, "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a state of legislation on legislative acts and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday with that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the most ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "this step has made Moscow mysterious." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the enges of his intimate Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a Stef he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, he was broadcast on TV, claimed both the men who resign his staff on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are just a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official argument - that a man who was once more touted as potential president, had to lead to Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - a job for four years to trust.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously worked as Minister-President and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council (FSB), was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin told the power he called Ivanov more than one of five men whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was thought, Ivanov went to President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third presidential term should be choked against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Quefied Crossing: bridge now connected with fife</seg>
<seg id="2">£1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the nordeck of the Queensania Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four persitions of the "cover bloom," which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge cut of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 Schrägseile.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown left a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensboro Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly epic extent during this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the Brückendeck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge are at their place and the last section of the Decks gets today in Rosyth a prayer for the deck, which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridging project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the zipper presents trend-oriented high-building and deep-building.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last tram section and its connection with the expansion of the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the full gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern states of 700 millimeters at the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massif because the viadukt 222 meters long is, about 6,000 tonnes, and when a gradient of about 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, as the tolerances were working on which the team works, tiny - on each side they rusted them only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is going to lose nearly 1300 favourable apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept for living."</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost goes to the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we are united with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will in future be 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can also arise in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the town hall may be, as violas:" "" "how can one deal with investors to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing as possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal residential construction program that will cost millions of cost and will still be financed, should provide enough incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as violas:" "" "there are currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU aims to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants harshness conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, as violas, bahs a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 favourable apartments whose support is going on in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone through the year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy in Nicole Palm, should now be bought out by the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, it would have to be thought to take apartments back into the price connection.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">One stroke will be able to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city the year-end deadlines are running.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments, one could get back to prices for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">For example, the number of social housing in the west city has dramatically increases, the aim of the so-called mix-mix.</seg>
<seg id="31">There will no longer be a concentration of social weak in only a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens assume that there will be no movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "Chief Executive Officer Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "for a wide majority, the CDU has to take into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child can no longer walk out there, but rather to spend their free time, on screens, was fired in the last decade of many laments.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and to get active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not close each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on characters who first were created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of popcivilisation, the interest in front of the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand early July somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphones are searching for out and look for Pokémons who were tracked with a GPS once they were found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the expectation and sprang out for the quest of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA the game led to a considerable rise in steps that determines the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users persecuted, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted folks that train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for an increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring" "" "to get involved" "" "from the sofa" "" "to be active every day, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overjudged.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this way three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also lively games that have always been complaining about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activist will be combined in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">They are the "Led Five," because the next Olympics are just four turers in the team. moreover, that is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality tells us that Turns is a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents for training, interior, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). this list will continue to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the gymnasts obtain its entire training and that is a more expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes, since they started with the turf.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired by the congregations aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a high-weight and easier to access trainers.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Moderator and Travel-author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk narrow his course on a euro shot, a railings at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing buttocks as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before departure of each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he gets involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stwarth," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lew the rinsing a drawback, which was already used by thousands, may be totally repulsive but actually there are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright with doctors and medical specialists spoke about the encouragement of bowel bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he diminished, more than a bad taste of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of his intestine by having traveled through the world and the peculiar as well as wonderful things ate.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations through to rinse valves, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His prostitute showed a Luminometrium of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">As compared to this, the Luminometrium is freshly picked up less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to descend, after their Luminometriess over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands a number of less than 60</seg>

<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stwarth" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish maker of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company-owet Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings that ended with it that we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he had some of the things I have instructed to lect him, just like the ekelous Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty titreats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents conducted from 2015, in particular with the wellbeing of gastrointestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products that are included with lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually purchases sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the commentaries to overlure him under the pseudonym of non-Alleensamenmen with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougv, the complex development of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials, who like to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cab-group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through Hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older records remains to spend their feelings more (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Yougv?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy road in Soho drives, a modest grey trage and wild, before I stand steal, my hands hold, and slightly define man, like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart sohos goes slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller have been located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by watching.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) into the Receiess Records (data number: eight men middle aged men, one woman, probably about the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate" "" "I guess" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approximately 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These Schallplatten, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford, when they appeared and buy objects that he sold, when he was young and pleading.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which was released, when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meet at Yougv's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who will be influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted to get back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the conversations that I have led, people usually have been emptied to their collection in 1998 or in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their plates, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to followers of a set of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some discos-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundboards, from objects, the happy juriderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the foyer of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "we are solute a member of a flat stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who have one plate, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I bladed with a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged men), has noticed a "trophy of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record plate, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicous.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I do not have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who only get slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop that has devoted to the Schallplatten almost one whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women middle aged men.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast New thesizers and sexcgrilled pop instead of experimental jazz users from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks quite lonely, but wet psychological traumata are hard to ascertained when you stand next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for several minutes and looks at the variation of the available records.</seg>
<seg id="49">It seems rather a mannequin as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of boards is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or another, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a lover-loving epidemzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it truly is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, that is said that a new generation of turnkey players is to have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note, the jeans hotpants to patterns, I watch a group of young teenagers, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering getting a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff humley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "discos."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for deluxe items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results, that the results of Yougv vote, they, at least in record-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and discoverters, who exist in reality, discos and in Onlinefors, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while they steer the starred view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, protrudes over the shoulders of nothing other middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby arrived in the Final on Thursday evening to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Dealer stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, Repressing, scheduled flight and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic waist of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was ralled by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they pitched New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to it in the Final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of it would have taken a 15-man team in the form of a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolace for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite morning will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost at Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop will do something, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and letting the attacks be GBs from fun supres.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the Captain Tom Mitchell on and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners proceeded 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With yet four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai is still going another attack from the right-hand corner that he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball rolling.</seg>
<seg id="16">A favor of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it has only stopped fiji.</seg>

<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-record and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preset through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the UK still has dained.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, what was good for relations of the first half time until Joshua ran through a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner of a 36-7, but the game was running long for long in favor of the southern Bohemia, whose fans sanders and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame performed the cake icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotless gold than with these games and that wants what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those two, who were in the board, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present as she was on the second Olympiad in two without a tax result, the first women in the history of the British sport that placed on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39,ter is untrained, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected the nature of the Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in ruin a battalion want to contribute to the incremental progression, which make up the difference and it was no one assistant than the trainer who would survive 30 months ago, whether he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he is going to risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had blowing cancer, which is sacrificed and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere from.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty scant situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could start to break the break to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 walk, 50 foot to a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve firing morning with a little more than usual to speak and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an employment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">There are only repeating how much I and heroen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person to exercise or wish for a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning has not lost over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, panning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "lead in the process," "" "stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It really is important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we did not come out to make some Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a fireworks, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensibly towards breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, there will be snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already has as absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are ingenious, self-effective tools, which generate more than 30 million improved selfers per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps will be transferred to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of, that the App Blackface becomes shaped or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week a filter shaded a filter, which gave them Schlitzaugen, false teeth and raised cheeks, there were some critics as a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow-sighted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy surrendered to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread in Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and motherboard, one day after snapchat communicated that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to Anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders that have experienced pedimatism, recalled the filter to inviolating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other refrained from the anime-comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet have been widely used across the photos that the filter is "hurtful and wrestling unpleasant was."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrasting of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowly sighted, but that the yellow-sighted into the disposed extremities has been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural approaches.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be implicated in an endless dialogue and integration of integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are dipped in matters as their older opponents - might seem to be expected to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats's film creates a picture that is insulting to a user, "so it's much harder that such things remain unnoticed when it was formerly the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided to use Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineers for medium to extinguish their Snapchat account, others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an attachment for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believe that rence-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the adjusting leaks at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the partially part white, only male leadership and ended their set with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no various representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so that they can meet such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours, who work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or feel at home, in order to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat has been largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no figures on diversity of its staff and points out to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, there were Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently focused a personnel responsible person focused on under presented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to tell that that is not o.k. is."</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the field-hockey of women, a showdown with the UK.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans was won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "" "I said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not belonging to the people who kept their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are like in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unduaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals. the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will move the strong Holders a little longer out of the path that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising ancestral through their success story, four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time played a hockey club in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years she became a member of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as it could not qualify for the Catholics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, a Englishman, Trainer of the National team and thus began to turn the things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working order in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the Rug which can be carried out completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday morning Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and took the play of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam the game took into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She finished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flange, then moved to the middle and lute the ball in the gate to get the US a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the Torkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who has previously had to book a gate inside each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just as Bam.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of oolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late there is also, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and indifferent, a rapid relay of competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stack, which is handed down from the wristwatch to swimmers to the triathlon.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop when talking your neighbours, without more about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's skid with dimples would certainly have been sent under these known names, built up to Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminates any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partially in the shade there are sports, which are not generally accepted: airbrush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the nighost, and let it be long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me guide the attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000 it was an olympic event than it had been in Sydney the last 16 years so pointed out that many people I asked, did not know that it is an olympic art.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States hoped for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had one athlete to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outer corner, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiastic enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never end wolves - but also the refinement of the gym and diving, the two sports which essentially unifies.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Jump winners on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to turn a number of falling movements (rotating, pike and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to the earliest Olympiad according to the execution, difficulty and" flight time. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and dron, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the line or the power wall, but also of the television transmission, but also in the television transmission: the world or the Olympiad of the olines.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatics - and it is enough to make even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I perceive even when looking at these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunted, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaults in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is expanding the extension as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Among the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably ignored in general tumor.</seg>
<seg id="39">If awareness increase only reaches through the anxiety and the lenses of male athletes can be achieved - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently proposed by The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Dooley expects his after air rinse, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a Generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a Prussian ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in Schorum.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia especially to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government became the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week of thousands of people on the streets and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot at zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moving out videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how carers will hit young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country in and in future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians, to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in the remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new sequel in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Sixty Ghome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomfort that cover everything from the ground use to stranglehold in relation to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a particularly critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this zag, controversial line required in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-liberating front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which were forced more or less forced in recent years to benefit the turbulence over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of whom are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheap Smartphones were increasingly common and the internet services were improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter, which at regular intervals, especially in protracers, many people still can communicate about internet proxies which conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they assembled themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons of prosperians, the Amharas, which come predominantly Christian floods, in the politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating with a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader in the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a not the most publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analyst tell that he was particularly wasted in making early signs of discontent and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian New Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Germany, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia has experienced such a turmoil after thousands of elections were protested against the government, which was apparently circulated by the government and subsequently stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and those days of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts in Ethiopia, leader of their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal missal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of the demonstrators in Gondar, an amhari city, from Tigray-owned shops and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more commonly practiced in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Droneaster on neighboring Somalia, even though they rushed to leave this base closed.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to collapse his allies in a already volatile region." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump is explaining his claim Obama has been founded... "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign that his multi-repeated argument, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying statement cast new questions about the communication skills of the Lipublicans and publicans whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its collaborators, who make efforts to take him during an uneventful phase in protection, to explain to the peculiar position of statements, which he could not meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday-Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was returning to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he is simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposition to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to diminish the statement by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, he wanted to know nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the critique bounds upon Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>

<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic.</seg>

<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism of himself when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clintons of emails, but later he explained "Natural" I said the sarcastic. "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump announced another sound, because its demand trend continues to go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he won't take a groll about that the soap-shop has taken the old business room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclist is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the boat ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie first got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the ground of the North Atlantic ocean, the Grönshark located on the ground of the North Atlantic Ocean, at an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this peak speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of slowed lifestyle seems to be a patronage for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported on scientific journal "Science" at least one of Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity" "", "commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only fail the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are hard to observe, eventually they live primarily in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees centigrade, they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the way of life of Greenland researchers, researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-pentagm measures pointed out when they overlooked six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a animal researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw-bones of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase for sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of Eismeeres and seek Kadaver, which from higher aquariums in the bottom torangles.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a congesting of the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters in size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lineage of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eylinse is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins included in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, larger quantities of this radioactive carbon is induced in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimetres length third-smallest animal, the lors on the other hand has a low overshot on carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Grönlandhaie had in their ruler to contrast normal carbon-14-quantities which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 cm long Grönlandhai an age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old may be.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönhai females only got offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length could be assigned to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters at ease at the threshold of the sexual readiness and his age was determined at 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the multiplication obviously at least one and a centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalos live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record-keeper, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, in whose speck at the neck, a 120 year old hardship lace, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures there is often the organism of the animals living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and then slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water the animals are often particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal leaves heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal was supposed to invest his resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere would once have taken over-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus would have a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere could have had and yet slowly reversed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect life from faster amorous.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun, which was 30 per cent Matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulates the slow rotation of Venus its daily side of the sun nearly two months long," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun warmer.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degrees of cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought of planetary research.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide presses hackers your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers from conpressors are currently focusing on companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware accounting specialists of Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack with compressor software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been target of a ransomware blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid to the victims requested by the perpetrators demanded to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their represser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential ransom ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the pollutants," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the artists were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the culprit software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, however, private users were the target, but the transition to company attacken took place during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, they search for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives files and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the software presents the demands of the preschser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptowish bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users use the personal photo database in the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which increases production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, higher the damage falls if a ransomware beat.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales shareholding through ransomware, 13 per cent had even had to do business completely, in case there were people in life-danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health care.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays not, you thereby promotes only the problem" "", "explains Caslectic Pole." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the light of stalemate.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure gives the usability surfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access-to-date support websites or decode for free example.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are to redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred tonnes, companies have to pay partly tough and five digits to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmailing, the hacker will always be more professional and share the work, explains security professionals, Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable is it possible for three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damages then in the form of a software construction of the actual groundwork.</seg>
<seg id="30">The past Malware kits were created by the Malware themselves, consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The vpresses are then looking for further hackers in order to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per authorised machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then carry spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies active companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be drafted by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful recognition, the perpetrators are calling up with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential for damage, depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators in future could now take completely new goals in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon illustrated safety researchers, such as they could get a thermostat under their control over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a block-controlled heating could certainly be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block all production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you sit around eternally, at night they lie around for hours, in the morning there is nothing more to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is possible with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adult male disease and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently recover.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you hear sleep problems or sleeptive disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes underlying, Hans-Günter Wegener, board member of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Sleep.</seg>

<seg id="8">Just this can sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German Household Association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeptive disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it may be organic, psychological or misconditional factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early warning is common especially on depression," "" "says Weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that several factors conduct each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a slipped disk, can be bad, watches all two to three hours and begins blurry to pondering about all-day problems and worry, there is molding an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one be with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who is not well sleeps about a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor betray Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is dismissed, weary, uncomfortable, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has voicing fluctuations or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the decomposition, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">One treatment options include such behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tabletts only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Downward sleeping sickness is made in Germany barely, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary & Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedtime, one should first turn to sleep-problems first to the carinarian, heaters Weaters.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clear with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should sleep in bed, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in child labour, it is possible for example with snoring with respiratory disorders, in case of disease cases, in case of sleep wroneiness or if one does not find the cause of a master-storks, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not need to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "do not take a midday" "", "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body there is a nose-envelope, a chest strap and a torch at the finger.</seg>

<seg id="33">How can fraud get the problems get a handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of payers where you can bet for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeks count on: regular bedtime and lifts, not too long in bed, not to sleep in bed, not watching TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night not look at the clock - then one starts out immediately, and that is quite and not beneficial.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altes, a few lenses, some leftist streets away: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first glance, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks down the road from east to west, one passes on playing places, a freshwater kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house someone has ugly! "spectively."</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl who is to be demolished soon, is already built: by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new studio apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy area," as the responsible property firm Friedrichshain, are however preferred in recent weeks however preferably with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ground is the house with the number 94: once it occupied, meanwhile, the residents have rented tenants, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year the Berlin indoor Henkel plant had been a decisive action against the police in the beginning of the year, called the area as "no-go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22nd June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police statements, the police had three weeks official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the ground, dry parts of the street and kept the visitors from that house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and building workers went under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves forward.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer lives in the pines since 1999, and Jana *, which draws three children here, especially from the police presence of genera.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the houseprojects they share the concern about rising tenants and Gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a pines who wish to make a majority of police protection from vandalion left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between the homebremembers and their neighbours to open, does not exist as evidently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which today compared to the rest of the city, a lower average and risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home network and the born dwelling projects belong long to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near the town centre.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under the big law battle, many of the projects in the town of Riga were occupied and are still inhabited by the people nowadays who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district of the last few years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and election liners from all over the world: with them all inhabitants of GDR-times and former homebreer gathered their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This makes things noticeable also in the rental, which has risen almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the reconstructions in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them by slipped disks or newly created facades, which were rejected with shades.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often with the words "linksautonome violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours could see that as problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury, statistics, according to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the criminal offences make incidents that tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years, next to the controversial 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for non-violence, it is critique: people in the 94 are their neighbors, which they certainly not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it no longer to the town of Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the rig-headed street - and stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also important that people get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants of the inhabitants, the road will continue to take away: with sighted new buildings in former buildings, which throng the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are not very condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well bewilful," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not share." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Here, there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the occupants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For shelter resulting from colosbombs, Kerstin has little understanding: the houseprojects and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls in a pub, to complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons asked only with first names are asked to do not be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore she is social worker on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee agent for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogues supports the team of management at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, working and refugee assistance, administrations, authorities, and who else fails.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client of the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the curative Wollmilchsau, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a consequence, some - less mockingly than on the multitude of desired tasks would be purposeful - as the administration wanted to write down the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, joined by many years of experience in the field of social work, just a variety of experience.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all it is about organization, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle honest and full-time actors support. "" "</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting people who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to place refugees in own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must take the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratory to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a very difficult quest for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work so far, unless you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, most of the apartments must be visited as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, the Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed Bleibe, there are traineeship, training places, school courts, A-Euro Jobs and help activity for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster work, do-profit work - and this motivates and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That was "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a degree of national.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here management and volunteers are also taking place.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling that they were welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make it sensible to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, that will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "however, there are also, says customer honest," "" "people at which nothing is about." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer therefore is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">That is all already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences are fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no, says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what mancher may call" "". "an residual risk could and wants to close it out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized be the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into recall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus the main and volunteers need to stop in the region and in the region according to its activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have the background that soon a new Stoß in refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, do not shy the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Reguline customer also makes clear that the Urbacher would have already been seasted to integrate the present human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "but when people are in need, one should need to help them both women agree." "" "" ""</seg>
