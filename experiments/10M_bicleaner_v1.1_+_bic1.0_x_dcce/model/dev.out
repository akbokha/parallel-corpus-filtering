Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to cross the implementation of the international agreement as well as oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
but it is also the meeting of the conflict with the Palestinians and the argu@@ ably two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been anxi@@ ous for many years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the en@@ during settlement of Israel and eng@@ ul@@ ing a lack of thinking in the peace process .
through the deal of Obama wor@@ wor@@ ed deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu at the invitation of the Republi@@ can was held before the US Congress a disp@@ uted talk , which was classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election as an imp@@ ending election in Israel .
in an emergency , Professor , his girlfriend was shot
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon &apos;s was with a slightly tender voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; still live and probably be excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officers found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ us and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to und@@ o , I loved it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that held in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , under@@ judged , having already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he has killed and killed by the police for a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ be@@ ating Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that universal employees are shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he was taken a ill @-@ f@@ ated emergency , sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life when the police stopped him .
a day after shooting at the university , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators in both en@@ ches of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , was helped to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps a difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
he himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he divided his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose courses were 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised , he also seemed a bit excited and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for an ur@@ ination for health reasons and said that he had any other health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to a job as assistant professor .
universal President William La@@ j@@ ha@@ ge said he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b Ide@@ as . &quot;
these are questions which I can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back yard of a home approximately one mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ ds Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people that lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he began his work at the University of 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught Geo@@ graphy and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he graduated in the spring in Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
one of the many years of friends lam@@ bs him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in the high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was then the woman of women at that time .
all the girls then mel@@ ted if he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency I said , &quot; I was killed my wife , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were divor@@ ced in 15 years ago but friends had stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played two years ago both on a summer months .
later they played together one or the other gig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ a has a nurse used for various business online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper , and sometimes under@@ dog coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th of September last appeared , after he finished his guitar and a harmon@@ ic asp@@ iel before a pointed audience .
there was no evidence that something was unanim@@ ous .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the reception and jo@@ vial together .
I mean , both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the Red Professor , headed the first @-@ term seminar programme and specialized on American banks and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Bro@@ therhood and of the students &apos; councils .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland , on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community participate in a candl@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration .

Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ book P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this review .
this story has been corrected to refu@@ te that the police did now say that He was shot at the emergency , and that lam@@ b was shot in his emergency ad@@ o@@ ist rather than his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever mar@@ ries .

Michael J. Fox is king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting at the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says that the response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader demands again all parties , including its shared UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meeting the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Council meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called on the five permanent members in dealing with the crisis in Syria , show the same solidarity and unity , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear de@@ centr@@ ation with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ frac@@ tional values , which show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to mark him as a flop to brand new brands .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try , Donald Tru@@ mp are moving from the upper ranks of surveys to the bottom , it has ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed by Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate gul@@ ly .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody affir@@ ms that tru@@ mp will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that during that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given a lead to rising Herman C@@ ain that no one has gained except one state in the nom@@ inations process .
there are many reasons why he would have been struggling with a general election .
but outdoor groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ gone Super PAC and the conservative economy group Club for Growth realise now Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current transform@@ ations that imply that the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s exposure properties have turned 180 degrees sp@@ h .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth University , that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate moti@@ gu@@ l .
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion from Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten predi@@ ctions that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week said 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they were either &quot; amazed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; upset , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the Candi@@ date would be .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans can not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish Republi@@ can Irish voters believe the real temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac final week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not p@@ asse to the White House , ABC / Post .
re@@ public@@ ans voters get used to the idea .
when they set their nests , there are Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time that four out of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans , that Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination until only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters can be viewed as plau@@ si@@ bly .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around a country , Tru@@ mp suggests that nearly every one .
some experts indicate that the spl@@ inter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and the most other re@@ public@@ s candidates , Tru@@ mp is having the multilingual support .
he took advantage of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally from Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who will take him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the Tru@@ mp , say they have established their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s strongest competition is at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp upon immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaigns were two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the influ@@ x and fishing point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic output pressure from Tru@@ mp is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans to be kept from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation endeav@@ ours .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans tell that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration .
so long as the in@@ filtration in the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , it will be Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , there is about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider &quot; one with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa presents two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; and 21 percent &quot; ru@@ di@@ cally . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five exclusive housing in Germany

&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is limited in accordance with , it is said in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study reveals that the specific clim@@ ates will cost an area of most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top towns , the price does not appear like Pe@@ an@@ uts .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Mu@@ eller and I@@ dol
despair Tor@@ ment@@ e in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy talk by Thomas Müller p@@ aving the FC Bayern the way to a comp@@ elling 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sou@@ l@@ ly pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario i@@ dol gave a dream start to the &quot; mission Milan &quot; at the Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ols there hit 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth victory in series is supposed to be the first step in the direction of Fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich .
Müller was awarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s premi@@ er co @-@ operation by Schw@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ sten@@ Roberto , who made an original shot of the world &apos;s shot .
&quot; we won &apos;t cher@@ ish it , &quot; had promised Bayern lam@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ flo@@ cks and the Mün@@ chner stopped word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without being shiny .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the king class , including against well @-@ known clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were brave , but with their evi@@ den@@ sive efforts , but are often too influ@@ ential works .
the attacks were too often introduced to links on link@@ age at lef@@ ty Douglas Costa introduced to rarely through the former Braunschweig master O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had from the right more luck , than his flan@@ ks turned out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left margin .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world master gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as ol@@ ymp@@ ic @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown captured the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct start , the Tor@@ were Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bavaria had lived their usual role in Bavaria , Piraeus and re@@ con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
on Tor@@ ry Manuel new@@ er was however am@@ let .
so , as he sent a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola allowed to defend a four @-@ awa@@ o with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario I@@ dol , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the pool , sat at first out .
the World Cup player only gave to the final training green light , said sports vor@@ es Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , which is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought King@@ ley com@@ an for the Lew@@ k@@ oma Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .

in front of the game , it was in the stadium for Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly prov@@ oked Bavaria fans in their audience block , the disciples of hosts had prov@@ oked re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , seized the security forces and went through the kno@@ cks against the Mün@@ chner followers .

who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , thus not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that lays down a Potsdam @-@ long study .
the good news : in case of susp@@ ici@@ encies the risk is fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is also emerging from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ E@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared with non @-@ smo@@ kers there was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to reduce the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the researchers had seen more than 23@@ 300 participants .
lead C@@ ables for br@@ aries are c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth @-@ car@@ nal , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore attributed to most common dental @-@ fl@@ esh@@ opping at smo@@ kers .
do not be clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking is also increased the risk for tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could last over ten years until the endangering dropped again to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained first aut@@ eni@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
you must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the life @-@ time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for trucks and vessels and constantly results in good dental health to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population in the age 65 to 74 years of age are affected by ar@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with them .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ate the findings .

EU @-@ Commission propos@@ ing a TTIP
to the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transpar@@ ant system which in its function clearly represents more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wed@@ w@@ av@@ ant has to put the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US &apos;s free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
through TTIP , the largest free trade area of the world is created with 800 million people .
the plans for re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings agree that the EU states and the US choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
they are to be made in equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
it is intended for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to lev@@ y against discrimination .
until now the procedures involved commit themselves to the arbitr@@ ator , an exit to their parts there was not .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice .
in the long term , she wants to work for its own information on an International Sale of Investment .
the real estate site could also be clari@@ fied for example between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbitration ( IS@@ DS ) above all are considered one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ds , on the companies &apos; compensation , national laws and susp@@ ect the reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act proposes the proposals of the EU Commission as an insufficient .
the fact that it was not critici@@ zed for the actual free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic Inter@@ state secretary Matthias Mach@@ ines ( SPD ) signed the plans in contrast to be significant progress .
the Commission included significant points for the reform of the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trading ministers .
the old system of private arbitration stays from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .

district Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which p@@ ushes the picturesque US state of Michigan with fil@@ es@@ stal@@ ks .
the entire public , about 40 persons , is nearly taken by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
he describes on the basis of various places he always records on the map , which reports on his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ed and tender songs .
where they came into being and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been a wonderful creative ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart , written songs , which can harmon@@ ise very close to American Folk and late se@@ ven@@ ties but can be dri@@ fting at any time .
there is the sc@@ aff@@ olds , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a wi@@ genic series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states should be en@@ forced in consequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens is where Stev@@ ens is based on .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later he returns to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece .
brid@@ ging of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album is single in the U.S. Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual install@@ ment list of the influ@@ ential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Mr. Stev@@ ens is based on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic records .
this sixth studio album is still broadly orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats , and plays with all sorts of effect and hall .
for the long time the smaller clubs are climbed , the stage shows here to the colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ brow@@ n@@ b@@ ändern round and large fluor@@ escent stones .
currently tour@@ t Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

although here nearly 2000 guests are rel@@ eg@@ ated in their chairs now , who swe@@ pt up a clearly s@@ itt@@ oral Stev@@ ens back to intimacy and to folk .
without a word to direct the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide enriched album .
from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter , &quot; and one can then throw the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut on the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n debut on the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour @-@ president Wei@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to put his debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and put his debut on the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is rising to ask the first of its six pres@@ et questions shortly after noon , with its performance by the media probably and the Labour MPs are likely to be examined .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ pped some sessions around her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance because she comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ un@@ in@@ etts and after his speech on Tu@@ c @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ n has prov@@ oked at a commem@@ oration for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is at the center of several front @-@ pages Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in a respectful silence &quot; and he got the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ un@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he won the Labour president to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; regardless of his belief that monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve with Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party they originally supported as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be within Labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements about the position of the European Union and the limit for winnings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference , that Labour &apos;s changes in order to eliminate the whole idea of a limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow and R@@ ent ministers said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ at 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chair , President David Cameron , since then he is a T@@ ory boss , over the dispute over the E@@ AL @-@ Box in parliament .
the Labour president , who promised another policy sentence , says that he called &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister to confron@@ t@@ ational is , and that he is subjected to &quot; impact &quot; and the dispute with resistance hook , and instead carried out to serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has told Angela Eagle , that is represented by Angela Eagle , the shadow of the Coun@@ ts for whom he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron has travelled abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he had addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is joined by politicians in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; who often refers to the Prime Minister &apos;s style . but some years later he dre@@ amed that he failed .
since they were sent on TV first in 1990 , the questionnaire was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of urine and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his Par@@ liam@@ entary groups , although critics argue that it has become a caric@@ ature and had become farther @-@ sufficient reforms .

the pound has long been showing ben@@ ign according to data , which show an increase in the U.S. growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the F@@ TT was increased by SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result was growing without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was since 2009 the fastest and brought up reviews at the time of a rate of interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro on 1.@@ 44@@ 30 € .
the F@@ TSE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % on 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after taking over the Rival AB In@@ qu@@ v .
one transaction , the two largest brewer@@ ies of the world combine , and brands like Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ .com , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ m@@ sch .
the berry stocks were after encouraging messages from the competition company for luxury goods ri@@ chem@@ ist 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ es latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that the sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - to resume growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore came up 5 % after the mining giant said that he has taken € 2.5 billion by a stock market as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper @-@ group MO@@ N@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had his estimate for the firm rating based on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the sport trading company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D sports says that higher wages put its expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher wages for UK workers &apos; means &apos; more buying power in the pockets of potential customers &apos; could mean .
but it is unlikely that these buying power will pay the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less extra jobs .

met@@ cash starts ground @-@ speed campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - inf@@ estation
met@@ ar@@ r is trying to protect Ig@@ A @-@ stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ Break@@ ing in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ ers has launched a ground @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen Met@@ ers and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers , and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de &apos;s Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores specimens and shop owners , which sell tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected to receive further details from its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler Convention on Food , Al@@ co@@ hol and Devices crosses its annual Invest@@ ors strategy .
it &apos;s a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia , almost 30 percent of met@@ cas@@ us Ig@@ A @-@ shop @-@ shops , and higher profits as met@@ cas@@ us Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states , generate .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ cally provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in East Australia .
however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that the Al@@ di 12 months after opening up its first markets some five percent of the food market is torn away in these two states and taking away all existing actors , but mainly independent single retailers .
a report published in this week according to Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ Sing@@ ers will lose 360 million sales revenue per year and a met@@ cash 250 million to late 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di was opened next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss of food and food store and with the amounts on met@@ cas@@ hing @-@ high Fi@@ x@@ cost @-@ based could cost a funding of some 13 million dollar profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time a met@@ cash market shares in the East states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently performed survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Le@@ aders are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ cade &apos;s revenues in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , to drop 4.2 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eat in Melbourne , that Met@@ ers would likely be cancelled within a decade .
Met@@ ers refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ eo@@ with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass .
IG@@ H@@ market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hin meets food and food outlets , which provides about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , which has been around 43 percent since 2012 , which is refle@@ cting its operational debt reduction in sales and marble .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ades more than 150 million US $ , sales prices with col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ ds@@ men with hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores due to increasing fresh food and delivering a better choice of private @-@ label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ hing &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and charging programs to El@@ an are hop@@ ed and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth in the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ase is supported by the president of the Australian tennis and Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral threads &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kir@@ gios and deserves to view the president of the Australian tennis @-@ association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behavior .
coconut palm , the youngest of talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as a &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; concluded by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka to the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ase and his opponent had to turn separately to Har@@ rison , with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to kno@@ ck , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he struck a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a var@@ ic@@ f was in@@ hibited the potential US Open @-@ Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , the Co@@ kin@@ ase was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the Davis Cup finals at the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I was pretty much tigh@@ ter , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi a little has been drawn into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost because of a struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a r@@ ack@@ et from fro@@ ust with himself , and I also know Than@@ asi to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he did extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated in a little too strictly .
he is a very rare 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he is working on the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is doing tough , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also didn &apos;t consider the decision to consider Kyr@@ k@@ gios on the important pre@@ decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; collective decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the controls around the controversy - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick was very quick to make the Ascension , but he asc@@ ends up in the eyes of the public , and he has pushed for him to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holding refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ p@@ ted the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm attempts to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants were gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and be@@ zz@@ ling be@@ zz@@ ling with rebellion .
the people who fled before violence , hidden for an unknown period in a land stri@@ ps on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled there .
but frustration went on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter above them moved , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman &apos;s policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a tri@@ lateral attack .
over the coming days it will have to take talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Serbian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block on a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0.000 people who believed in winter@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would achieve that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extraordinary summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put his hopes for a soon coming promotion of Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency room was held in two southern regions and more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could un@@ lock roads and speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed dra@@ in along its border with Rum@@ ania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence along the Ser@@ b border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ isons in the race , to create the bar@@ it@@ wire fence , between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bott@@ len@@ ght and access to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the coming migrants are refugees looking for a better life and for non @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border , or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also define higher pen@@ alties for the condemned human dealers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass immigration , the Hungarian government explains the state of the state , &quot; said Government spokes@@ person Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border @-@ crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to process the military still the use of the military service , expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have sought after the limits of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities did 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come by , and they hurt the fence , they are in police and are accused of off@@ ences of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities are quick to repair the fence quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian officials beli@@ ed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close down the border had arrived .
chaos c@@ ubs the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data from people and hit a crowd to push there .
about 20 succeeded in coming , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants did not block the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton tons before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US @-@ State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground toward the ground .
Clinton has now reached the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he has elected President of the Russian Federation , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of elections , most of the democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion stands as the candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost at a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had some prizes .
Clinton considers a big advantage in women and funds , but these proj@@ ections have reduced itself .
their support in the men is pl@@ ung@@ ed significantly , and S@@ anders is only possible with 5 points .
Clin@@ ically benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 have noted , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton still has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ scale lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections suggest they would be supported by enthusiasm , if it would be nominated by the Party .
a quarter would assist them with some fores@@ ee@@ pers and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically present supporters can be enthusiastic about all of you .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter would really support her .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters are saying that they want to support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters via their top @-@ kan@@ di@@ ties Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters can be asked in an open question why they want it to be the nom@@ inee as it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time that a woman &apos;s president is made ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ tons Sup@@ ans also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) mentioned .
agreement concerning the handling of problems and the voting are also cited .
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential system on the commodity , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election have seen him in the race - even though a third believed that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked in the election , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers to more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ anders .
decides Bi@@ den , not to kan@@ di@@ ke for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton has increased their lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five per cent of democratic voters do not see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has declined by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the most sel@@ ectable layer has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in case of candidates , democr@@ acies should ask questions about the voting .
similar to this last month no single democr@@ atisation candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er should be declared as unacceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ date or potential candidates provide good results with some key characteristics of voters in the election of their party .
plur@@ ality include Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited for the three candidates most from honesty , while Clin@@ ically &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not agree with it .
in general elections Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since issues related to Hill@@ ary Clinton was allowed to use a personal email address and a server during the term as external Secretary , most of the Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced by their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans now has been dis@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion occurred in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the email address had no effect on their general opinions on Clinton , though 36 per cent said that their opinion has been still worse .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy this remains a problem for them among voters in a total : just 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the elector@@ ate shall not hold them in an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elector@@ ate are also far from tru@@ mp than not honest and not tru@@ stable .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp are receiving good notes when running .
made of the six dedicated candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best at honesty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think about it .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to the survey behind Donald Tru@@ mp in Germany
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the other candidates , half of the support of the elector@@ ate falls in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in the Fox News debate over the past month by 27 % in the survey conducted from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son took over the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is be@@ aten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is the deepest of 10 % support last month on now 2 % .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ a@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the de@@ mar@@ cation in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some aspect stra@@ in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after car@@ son to ask for this , Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaigns in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if cro@@ pl@@ ets are measured only in the distance , enough for swi@@ m@@ ators already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water .
a dip in north or Baltic are likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some do not go into the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
water temperatures still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes at 28 degrees .
five members of the Bro@@ therhood will be charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
nearly two years after a student died during a single student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ grounds were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Bro@@ therhood attack Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death shared the police with .
officials said , he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 Po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen array on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ Bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waiting supp@@ osedly an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Bro@@ therhood , for advice he said pol@@ sign Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ ware and put the good for the Bro@@ therhood , fundamentally about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and died the next morning in his wounds .
after an automatic , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force to head aches to head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Bro@@ therhood of the Bro@@ therhood . at least one student dies before 1970 each year at the Schi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of third gra@@ des for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Bro@@ therhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for mis@@ por@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold them to account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Bro@@ therhood , and the national Bro@@ therhood led its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises the interest rates
an inser@@ tion comes , and the house will move into the wa@@ ver , ren@@ ces for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came out within just 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve upon raising of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor here , as the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants might notice that the whole excitement was potentially exagger@@ ated because of a means of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some than a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , boss with Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic Scho@@ ck , the many to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a based on historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of tin interest can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le .
once an increase is active , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be decreasing after 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts in a newer trial to what happened after the interests of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is mostly low in the past 35 years , mostly in the upward trend - approximately 14 per cent - on the way to cement construction , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Chef facility @-@ Str@@ ate@@ urs at Nu@@ veen &apos;s Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to occur later during the Hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and the return to it begins to decrease .
recept@@ ors are a fact of economic life , but they are often encouraging them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that could not have existed before and that could accelerate a recession .
extremely not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a cement of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 r@@ appro@@ xes since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only a few know that this is going to last and expect only the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these apply in so fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and take the question , &quot; whether this is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year on an inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strings and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could become an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading only has a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and Be@@ fore @-@ Rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ es very quickly asked about the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; said the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far the longest in which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this is already 74 months .
fixed in@@ comes also was vol@@ ati@@ le , as the market takes an inj@@ ecting , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect at bonds grew faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course .
at bonds the ren@@ ders appear to change as soon as the first raise / decrease occurred within the cycle .
at the end of the Hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle , the bond reports fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the str@@ ate@@ gen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to bringing yields closer between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ashing of curve .
high @-@ ins@@ ular bonds often bring in such climate better yields , although we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ ine at Swan , in an analysis .
of course , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the patho@@ ve is fl@@ atter , cre@@ dit@@ ches have risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy .
in large and whole companies undertaking the greater part of their own operations in the U.S. , benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tended to respond extremely positive three months after an initial phase of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ an@@ alysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed a sheet of marks after each of the interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
company with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in its shares met also their counter@@ parts associated with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are losing the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollar .
austerity could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are , how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , said parliam@@ ent@@ ator Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he increasingly cannot discri@@ minate on commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just the Br@@ its .
parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins hold up the mission The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something does not do what the private sen@@ ders do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC Bos@@ ses that the publicly @-@ Legal Radi@@ os@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly cannot be distinguished by its commercial competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 does not seem - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you actually just im@@ itate what already is in the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ates pointed out the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public awareness .
what I learn from radio 3 I will not read about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I consider also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to get involved in doing the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing organised in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for them under fire , to get the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins hold off The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for valued costs of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
he added that he wishes that the company will find a hit out of our own in @-@ house , &quot; if the next time it star@@ es a series of entertainment .
however , it refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money of mix@@ ers for other sub@@ stitu@@ tions formats .
Internet operations went up in August on the slower and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month , there has been the lowest possible result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped spending
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ iled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit @-@ cities .
however , experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales xes to the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , acting as a buyer , with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now you com@@ mu@@ te that and we will probably experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing transformation .
experts believe that buyer will hold their purchases on this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their be@@ aks , and some dealer @-@ sites cr@@ ashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gain , buyers could hold off , bought clothes .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium was out that 5 £ expenditure was spent on a little more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now performed via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people purchased clothes and shoes online instead of the mo@@ de@@ cks in the inner cities .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ cler@@ elle have already argued that the p@@ addle to Mecca , with thousands that will continue to come to the city will go on .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group could not have res@@ isti@@ ble the arm of the crane as he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ es that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency was said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would be responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking news of the news agency reported this detail not , however said that the company &apos;s leadership is not allowed to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which collap@@ sed in a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims led before the H@@ add@@ ling that were later held this month .
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of the cheap EU arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified arti@@ sans in Eastern Europe has an increase in itself
this leads to 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are opened to craftsmen ,
at the same time king@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales place nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is asser@@ ted that British put their H@@ äm@@ mer and brushes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who put their work in their homes ,
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to deal with walls , you now belong to a minority .
because British employ increasingly arti@@ sans in order to perform hom@@ eli@@ ke jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new business manager of King@@ f@@ isher who has the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low @-@ prices may now be out@@ dated .
therefore I plan King@@ f@@ isher , 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix Shops to open themselves to craftsmen and 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said it wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are made by women .
in the moment the men predomin@@ ate the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more female single households , which are more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move it stronger towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a British at the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index @-@ listed company , has also converted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance department .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ f@@ isher burned down a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the outlines after the group paid the cost of in@@ ference of the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .
functioning of A@@ I / D@@ whether due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
at the local court Kla@@ gen@@ furt took on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian beach of volleyball master A@@ I / D@@ whether because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ens@@ ation .
the accused did not find themselves guilty .
one of them had been charged for inci@@ dents .
he was arrested in May in force in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to upper @-@ state @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ investigations that the def@@ endants used in 2006 to 2011 funds of associations , via which they were disp@@ at@@ ched in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is aimed at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sport @-@ works are also indi@@ cted by means of financial .
this fact was divided by the chairman of the open @-@ op@@ ath , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later time .
at the age of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense was the case that the association did not develop an asset at no time .
the sports equipment only had allow@@ ances for pensions and the sports club , for which she has been active from 1982 to 2011 and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money , came out from the debts . passive displays ( around 4,@@ 000@@ ,000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we run the club further or lock it ? &quot; , told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread st@@ in@@ ator of the financial intermedi@@ ary .
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not held money , swe@@ ep our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life insurance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
been agreed with the club : you can manage the money freely , there may only be made no debts .
furthermore , the payment of the allow@@ ances were cancelled until 1991 on the occasion of the financial - success .
therefore , one has got some of the allow@@ ances for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus has been out on the account .
therefore also l@@ ump pi@@ ents and not detailed instructions on explained explained the former ob@@ mann the proceedings .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ aries are the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs of the club had not been manifested in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the financial crisis , important is just the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 an official investig@@ ator rose due to gar@@ an@@ age , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that was back@@ wards , the def@@ endants were asser@@ ted .
this securities was running on the name of the second accused , and according to whose statement the association was not known .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
I did not ask the question for a long time .
then he said he did believe that this is the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or put in the room .
the ten@@ ants would have been informed , legally the official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this money orders was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage ? , we wanted to know Ri@@ chter@@ in and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
at that stated the first accused did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function said he never received a cent content , he only reck@@ ons it o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
in di@@ ets he charged the Club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not entitled to show the accused .
these be after the operation , in which everything had been judged correctly , were no longer kept hidden , explained .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second accused .
all dom@@ ic@@ iles were made in cash , so he would have to go from his place of residence to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ alls new 30,000 jobs
in addition , for the three years current human resource design , the computer began to dismant@@ le further jobs in the development of the company .
the actu@@ ator at the U.S. computer @-@ computer @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not find an end .
the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate department in the context of its restructuring .
in this way , costs are to be saved in the amount of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.3 billion euros ) divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special rate of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs have not yet been completed for the last three years .
HP occupied the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 / about 30@@ 2,000 employees .
re@@ mitt@@ edly , the H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share gave 2.3 percent .
the Palo Alto Group of the Califor@@ ni@@ an Palo Alto , is currently standing on : so the computer and printing business will still be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the most demanding sectors with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock market .
once again a dis@@ appoint PC description and a weaker demand of corporate clients according to its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer to Len@@ ovo is most recently too .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printing presses grew by 1@@ 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25@@ ,@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds of 15 of 16 quarters went back .
HP wants to respond with a split and massive authorization for change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year old company under the guidance of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to the fact that customers are buying boo@@ ths and tablets instead of conventional computers and buy more and more stores online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan look at a total of around 5@@ 5,000 positions .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly arise against rejection : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent have shown himself .
that other states are flying against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
24 percent are against it , on the other hand , to interven@@ e in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad reject 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 per cent would be for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ ch : non@@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has taken off on Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as and water@@ head@@ lamps towards several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the non@@ risk of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it had a police line and behind the police officers was ready a water @-@ designer .
40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sticks and plastic bottles by officials .
the officials initiated an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper spray .
then the Police used Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as .
much of Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now rep@@ ain@@ ted a little while .
a pregnant woman and clearly the last woman was carried away from the zone .
children who met the l@@ ac@@ eng@@ a , cried out .
other refugees dro@@ w@@ ned in themselves and suffered under air@@ pressure .
also the press secretary of the Ser@@ b police have suffered injuries by the use of Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as and pe@@ pper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world has been observed if the US denom@@ ination comes in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists were asked by Re@@ uters it found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed is going to do so much longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest is set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank leaves the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good service level , tri@@ lli@@ on dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ d@@ ant view of global circumstances .
she warned the markets to stop an increase , but the signs pointed out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be posted on Thursday 20 : 00 CET on Thursday
death toll on the Delta State University sent sorry to write ap@@ ology
after the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he wrote on his colleague on the day - wrote Sh@@ annon for a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s Lec@@ turer for geography and social education at the Delta State University , calling emergency number from 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said , He was shot on someone , and killed someone .
he said to the staff of the emergency key that the police officers must send his home to his home .
he said , &quot; I was about my wife yesterday evening and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house be , but no one will inter@@ fere , &quot; but probably be excited .
the police demanded the recru@@ its after his name , but he did not give him .
he &apos;s no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the record I drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he discovered E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , to sle@@ w his own life on Monday night when polic@@ eman took him .
universal President William La@@ j@@ ha@@ ge said he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b Ide@@ as . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , that &apos;s supp@@ osedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ us also had a relationship , told authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss were told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had married about seven years than a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced in two years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have a daughter who is 19 and they were destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss have their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ a worked online from home , following statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which has been identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ a , which did a dog named Light@@ ning , took up for approximately three years with a Lady &apos;s Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to always help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , I created relatives at a certain moment on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
when a polic@@ eman took him on highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , I drove his car to the side , ran down in the woods and sle@@ w yourself with a shot .
he received a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his life @-@ lu@@ c@@ ław on the university web site .
stars that have lost their god@@ wit@@ ches
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his many years of partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs again , and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug use .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a major concert restructuring .
a half billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa , with a better organization , a half billion euros per year .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the job revenue .
with the pilot &apos;s union , there are many new negotiations .
the Lufthansa breaks its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the endor@@ sement of Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment was to be a result of around 500 million euros a year made of cost and income , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa is no longer a member of the passenger on passenger .
the endor@@ sement of Euro@@ wings are as independent as possible for this .
at the leading team he will be responsible for Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with the new position , Sp@@ oh@@ r underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employee was complex .
the airline @-@ lines under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , the three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pil@@ ots
in the tariff conflict with the pilot trans@@ verse cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations for the court stri@@ pped strike will be res@@ umed on this Thursday .
they shared the union with them .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement rule for pil@@ ots .
cock@@ pit wanted to come into a year with a forec@@ ast@@ ed record results &quot; as soon as portable results .
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ line@@ age did several strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is besides the transition from the pilot of the pil@@ ots the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it provides that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors stretches back by the group &apos;s own endor@@ sement at Euro@@ wings .
under the title &quot; Morgen@@ ade in the South &quot; are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus .
the Finn@@ mark based in Göttingen has already been created for the White Hall of the house a selection of tit@@ ell@@ os@@ er works , which anim@@ ate their viewers to embar@@ k on a journey .
Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for a month of double fre@@ ak
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double question of his right B@@ one .
while this has brought the left @-@ def@@ ender to the wines and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t be able to play again that Sha@@ w is able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w dep@@ ended in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg @-@ heart@@ ening and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which has very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed fortunate to be able to escape a Red map and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a el@@ f and a red card were required .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ky &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins right now , I come more and more back . &quot;
thereby : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
the England &apos;s defen@@ ders has an additional incentive in France to continue to recover during the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very smart injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a near @-@ break as Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear it is a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so that it looked like him &#91; Moreno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard it can be .
I feel very badly with it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book it will not take long before you know it almost completely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call himself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ made environment of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it &apos; was a difficult choice , writing Cameron in a message on the site of the company of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have an image or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron alle@@ ge@@ dly describes the plot of the book , instead there is a content of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to enlarge the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a good one , hopes to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he read , he read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el flour@@ ished and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if that were not susp@@ ici@@ ously enough , the text presented by Cameron presented itself partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is made on the site of Internet Movie database and it starts : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville where everything is artificial and even the air is a good , hop@@ ed a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is able to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron wants to become so little familiar with the action of the book . here , hear an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the monetary @-@ giving , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ak@@ y nature , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most probably was ranked such a relatively low PR task assigned to a volunteer who has not been able to read by The Lor@@ ax not 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ ak said that the text was probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons voting office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Cam@@ er@@ ons staff , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat not on my map .
I would not conclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ relief air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced as the three years ago , but there is good spin @-@ player in batt@@ ing placement , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
consequently news : Adam Ly@@ th came out of the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ ath is of course for me as his chief coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
at its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are focused on results .
there were no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this - players can choose their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully bring out more action to Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position even if he did not have so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question , how much time a test will get to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven winning opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do hom@@ et@@ ahs and back@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up was that England was first made in the Caribbean first - as Ly@@ th was at a maximum of a maximum - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a po@@ ised that I highly regard .
he is a X @-@ factor crime @-@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire from early this season when he had 2@@ 36 to us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square that met us very much .
he must obtain at least the same chances as that before him , but this depends of course the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , mos@@ ques next to C@@ ook suggest to leave as a Extra Spin of the Bow@@ ler and four tor@@ icks would give , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke cannot beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ man has already shown that he is a devil @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players .
Mor@@ een might not do his job for his County Vor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he immediately managed and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my restricted interaction with him , he very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a bit unt , but there is no large number of backup say@@ ers who have their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew England has made a few smart supplements at the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ wich , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the testing could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is used for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he is created for international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he will gain insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in tune with the previously predicted .
Col@@ l@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , won &apos;t be inserted at the One @-@ Day@@ an , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ c@@ aches and team controllers are not determined by the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are made not easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit Camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit Great Britain from the EU ) could gain in Zul@@ us , when the economy up until the year 2017 into a bott@@ led device
David Cameron &apos;s ren@@ ego@@ ing strategy to hold the UK in the EU , will get deeper trouble with each day , even without the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or Tu@@ c , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also made their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European dis@@ belief and said that some member states , so deeply hurt in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always from own debt , Britain itself created an agenda associated with sus@@ pen@@ ed conc@@ essions and distor@@ tions , which they mostly do not want to fill .
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided on its annual meeting , that it may not cause them if they put social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes a looking outside of the EU door to the outside of the EU - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some capitals to the point where they are no matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ab@@ hor@@ r@@ allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it is bad for her like Th@@ at@@ cher , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande reviews on his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a ver@@ sive power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain left a lef@@ tist .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that it will take a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie control whose energy should be used better for bringing Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar ones will have separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
therefore , some such ministers may even be pur@@ pos@@ ely non @-@ helpful comment , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ ral consumption in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , thought my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was bank@@ rupt , and &quot; Great Britain has nothing to won from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation .
the Europeans know how to lay down the Fle@@ et Street at its expense and which EU @-@ scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ on , but as they were by Tony Ben@@ n inspiring refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but were not to support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has taken a name for being a &apos; EU bar@@ ley ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s years .
in all his rel@@ u@@ ity knew Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ need@@ y gravel , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the pseud@@ o @-@ In@@ ns who own most of our major newspapers .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought much about it , but he discovered that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of serving to have lunch and dinner .
in fact , mili@@ ti@@ as has resist@@ ed more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir himself , as he has rejected Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ es , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle about that not adopted by the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him an am@@ ber .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly kn@@ aps on the back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t have any time more for me to do the need - seems at risk , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott of the 80 @-@ year years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ers Tenden@@ cy and the tw@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism , everyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ years , when his old father began to lay on television in television , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his head @-@ job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what about J@@ C told his collaborators and members of all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains in the age of television around the clock and above all things in the whirlpool of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right that Cameron want to give a free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold label support in the refer@@ en@@ fool@@ ish campaign for self @-@ knowing how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always thinks of that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ asy economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ sid@@ ents that is a central principle of dog@@ matic jurisdiction .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is fully convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to res@@ ign@@ ite - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obligated to try to find a sense of their super@@ vis@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin wast@@ ed political capital - they also mis@@ directed voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the US has already been rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a revision of the T@@ ory government in power which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a nation@@ ally financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less detri@@ mental than smoking , born out of a meeting of 12 persons , partly with ties to the tobacco industry , they said .
experts that write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined R@@ z@@ an by critici@@ ze the N@@ ativity of the Public Health England ( p@@ hic ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ hic published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ ner report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
one article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month has reached the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on the p@@ hic its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the asser@@ tion of p@@ hic that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed verification of reference and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision @-@ decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was given by Euro@@ Swiss Health at the meeting , whose Managing Director will have received from British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting had to obtain funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding which he should have received after reports before the Tob@@ acco Company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a variety of sectors financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in Table control .
at the meeting were also the tobacco @-@ management of the p@@ hic part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sl@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; harsh evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no one of these links or restrictions is discussed in the p@@ hic report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of p@@ hic that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes was as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ hic , said that the cont@@ en@@ tions of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all of the evidence is that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to small are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
lastly , the definite obligation to inform the public about what is proof of evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ ,000 people are dying at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion Euros per year .
due to the clear occurrence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for giving them public @-@ legal programmes that are probably seen by a smaller audience , on hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be on behalf or sends that were also clearly demonstrated by no sub@@ stitu@@ tions ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under its investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what to do in mid@@ - or long @-@ term for good idea , one should do so at least on programs that others do not want to do or order .
they send The Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous it &apos;s natural nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a shelf tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly these f@@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I am sorry to see how this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a company for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC is to blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are the again , which was the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ conference presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows should sell as East@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal situation should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can pretty judge the audience , but they can argue if they go to their apparent holy missions for the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody ever wanted to see it .
to broad@@ casting , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , you are thinking of all , thinking that you get a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC to check their maturity mission , to keep and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be interested in the public @-@ law TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms from which he said that only a handful of television can enter , and go with the commercial transm@@ itters in order to make things available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Review &apos; can control brain cells by sound@@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den changes the direction in the moment in which they are shown with sound impulses .
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by cre@@ ws of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ den changes the direction in the moment in which they have with sound impulses for the human hearing too high frequencies to be heard .
the stim@@ uli work through the en@@ rol@@ ment of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
further on this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ Review , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
pri@@ mor@@ ev@@ ils react not to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made sure they were doing it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ waves , who then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ m@@ ots cells .
the sound waves bind the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ onic phones carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
if he applies an ultras@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and incorporate them into wor@@ ms , where they turn into the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ Review , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to harmon@@ ise neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Review could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low waves of ultras@@ ound waves can be hin@@ dered and so they can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily aid the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily to make an ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatment , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y .
what we need now is a move of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal before our door .

eight golden rules for the life of a student dormitory ;
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormitory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles which I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ bed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into a student residence extends from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to watch dancing : people tell where you come from , whether and where you come to Sab@@ b@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest .
it distr@@ action the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were gro@@ oming in fire and those extingu@@ ishers .
let people go .
the people from people are often turning into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and per@@ si@@ le their under@@ wear .
doing this in mind : do not think about starting at the university with a relationship
contrac@@ ep@@ ted , you will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space @-@ to @-@ room b@@ aking culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I will know that our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I can get energy back for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to sense when a Com@@ milit@@ ant is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it an SMS rather than kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos t@@ ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student dormitory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship is close by b@@ aking .
since you start the university on the peak of back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ak is at the doors of people to imagine with a plate of Brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd than the welcome the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I forgot you a bit of feeling . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obligated to enter@@ tain yourself and will end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent B@@ aker .
poorly missed l@@ ump from flour , sugar and fat lead to people to sleep sleeping when you fu@@ ck down .
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residences .
of course , the clut@@ ches of chickens a theft , but is it the making of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
please check this with the Mil@@ k owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they bo@@ il inside the interior .
if someone is missing your bel@@ ong@@ ings , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a rin@@ se of their milk , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise , keep people from sleep , or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people that are sitting in the Glass House .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , if there is something else , Drum or bass slightly more qui@@ eter , because there were three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
you re@@ acted with older music .
when they finally got up at 5 p.m. , she sent her neighbors left again two hours before she had her own music , she concluded her door and ended up to her 3 @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same student residence ?
the way around it , it wouldn &apos;t be aby@@ sm@@ al embarrassing if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage , to turn to her again and then experience it every day and maybe experience how she pul@@ ls out all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner@@ in , try to talk a little reason at least .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone can have his keys in his non @-@ cast room , the border between a tu@@ k and bullying is just as it seems .
a good battle is fun , but it only takes moments , until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place by moving a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do never mind somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
connect your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you can then do in the freezer - but push your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terr@@ aced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ting , odor @-@ ear@@ ners
the property contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Central @-@ Turkish Eck@@ ental terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the deep @-@ extrac@@ ting mother and the Ger@@ ass@@ blo@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how to build good and good today &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees will be driven onto the market .
the owner Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are being pushed onto the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
because people remain in a great deal here .
in the light of the refugee stro@@ kes we also need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ ales , three @-@ story @-@ story house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least square .
it facilitates integration .
it is different if one places the people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three dwell@@ ings for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is situated at 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months of construction took me .
this is reasonable .
have the buildings for@@ f@@ aded their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building rights I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worthy special structure and the adjusting regulation .
gr@@ us@@ y .
it is still under@@ lining who creates three apartments in a terr@@ aced house , needs a minimum of three pitches .
only in the cities is not enough space for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respond to their terr@@ aced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have been assigned to me , luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is true : we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but have been built luxury apartments that hardly can afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the only en@@ rob@@ ing mother or the Ger@@ ass@@ blo@@ ener .
I am showing how to build good and well @-@ constructed today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone system , if Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gener@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are pushed after the installation on problems as they get an error , the communic@@ ates that the &quot; software update fail . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the storm is going back or trying to update across iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to make space - but Apple has made it more likely to go through the rolling out of the updates . equally , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is un@@ loaded during the upgrade or located near a charge device so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple can not be continued , as the phone might be running half way , and this may lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

Qu@@ arti@@ sen &apos;s office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Alten@@ centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have taken together under the Mant@@ el of the Social Foundation and the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz re@@ opened a new stop .
in addition to consultations one can also participate in courses .
the soup foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the inner city .
more precise in the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there a new era office became opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping cart , will immediately receive the sen@@ iors and advice information on questions such as to care insurance or to the benefits of nursing and nursing homes .
for years we are firm with our out@@ patient nursing service , that often the care depend@@ ents are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t rarely receive many services of the insur@@ ances because the complexity of the insurance companies will hardly be understood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new house master in Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new residential office offers also prevention , health care and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ udi@@ s has been taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as flash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the retirement offers from the Sen@@ or@@ Centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , cancer and Reh@@ a .
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; re@@ funded Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , manager of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of new neighbour@@ hoods in the city centre look at both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
after that make a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual neighborhoods of Bamberg in the future is essential .

Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
also , Sam@@ t@@ collaborative Champion Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ vers with Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside doctors - As@@ endorf on the contrary is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller on the first of October takes over the practice Fel@@ ic@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen died in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor will go to his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , the practice opened on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight than the field of Fel@@ ting ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met who currently completed their expertise in the App@@ li@@ ances , and also intends to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage works would fit well into this practice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ er and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it came to me , I was simply called up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the couple Müller , the idea fell to the future in as@@ ys@@ endorf to practice their own practice .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also see to be his own boss soon .
and so one was agreed , the gar@@ bage I bought the house with the practice .
live they continue to be in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up in his media room in Hannover followed several stops in several medical doctors as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .

from 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen has worked as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his spouse has specialized in ur@@ sel ( boarding ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle himself as a household .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after re@@ modeling the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and loading EC@@ GS , and need a microphone room more .
furthermore the E@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro received the gar@@ bage dump within the scope of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ alist Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter come into the field of field sh@@ ausen , in the northeast practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ endorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive by @-@ effect of the practic@@ ality by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
who visits the Expert Consult@@ ation , moreover continues to look above all in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the rim of the rim .
with their part@@ ing the departure in As@@ endorf ends an era , after all the medi@@ ans have worked for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; remembered Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
a little sad@@ ness wor@@ ms them after the long time already .
&quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see still often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have an 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed me to gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the couple has two grand@@ children and are eager to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls can also be reached at our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deg@@ ree in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain erect at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum , this could also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there was clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we cannot accept limit@@ less migration flows , neither through the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled operation .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave country @-@ pending refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under circumstances to become cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too .
throughout this , this was the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but rather the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary - intensify . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia shall be strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to dis@@ agree its borders to refugees but not .
&quot; each EU member has to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
like the Croatian government , the first refugees would have already been trying to travel in the night hours to the Tuesday to travel in eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to so@@ ften the registration .
the Croatian police could attack her in the near quarters of ma@@ go@@ ings .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik stands constantly police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily a matter of Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even lif@@ ebo@@ ats and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days of each country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo had brought to the Maced@@ onian border that have brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , should they be to take on the humans &quot; references to certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , anyway , in the morning a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers had been on the road all night long from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made us , so has told us the police that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might actually actually be the pre@@ forec@@ ast@@ ed shift of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia to a slightly farther west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees for possible exceptional circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have extensive possibilities to limit control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since 2007 , the EU partners in the country have since under@@ gone a good record of what concerns the standards of border controls .
on the side of the Hungarian border fence , approximately 300 refugees continue to stand fast .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ go that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ go and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees who want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to put fellow @-@ bodies at a local track in Hor@@ go : he kept the debates about aging routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently be a very high refugee deal .
one cannot say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees to land on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in some sections of the border territory , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian territory , still no more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police were known that a team was sent by minorities in the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians are paying 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have belonged to a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which is pre @-@ thrown , since 2010 has again gained insight into un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites like business wire , mar@@ qu@@ etry and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der @-@ shops will be made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , investig@@ ators had reported a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally tr@@ apped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further include in the case di@@ gest@@ ed .
most of the def@@ endants arrived from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have occurred both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ icity took attention with this action to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; this is life , so we went through the action in the midst of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the head of the Ö@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Prin@@ ces is available to the pass@@ ers , as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteer employees .
while some Pass@@ ant went spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k , and to read the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; to stop the war , &quot; or &quot; won &apos;t suffer many , others would be short to read , say , saying , say ... &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the edge of little discussions about the action in itself , of life , dealing with the dying .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is currently on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that for me the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic Works Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ hic representatives of the Ö@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Prin@@ ted .
therefore this public effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everybody wants to communicate openly with the tables , but be understandable , eventually it is a very personal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of death and dying be frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , who have contributed much to the Hosp@@ es movement in recent years have contributed much to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the mort@@ ar and Cer@@ em@@ aker belongs to the honorary staff of the first hour .
through personal experience , with the theme , they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the dying remedy .
in response to the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Prin@@ ted by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and was there during the creation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ici@@ on belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the insured and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with their job and experience the experiences and experiences made on it .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , consider it to be precious and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of out @-@ out ecumen@@ ism is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational regardless of respect .
the financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations affor@@ ds the training as well as training and super@@ visor of the stars and sorrow companion .
the two years are offered training courses for new employees .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes on post@@ cards can also be noted .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result reduced , Fin@@ anz @-@ prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex has been reporting disappointing results for the last quarter , and the re@@ efer gi@@ ants extracts its profit in a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ dying service .
the company also said that she is planning to hire some 5@@ 5,000 Se@@ ers for a vacation .
at this point in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 visitors for the holiday period .
the share fell by 2,5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ ex Corp. spoke to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than with the earlier predi@@ ction .
an@@ alysts expected to expect a survey of 10,@@ 84 $ according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower view is despite the price increase , which will be an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and be effective on 4 January and in spite of increased chances for bo@@ d@@ dying from severe and large packages which will be as@@ cer@@ tained for November .
the company said that it is nonetheless expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , increased revenue and due to growth in online trade will be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when you conc@@ eive the weaker economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holidays employment were announced a day later than that of Riv@@ al U@@ PS , who plans to set 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional staff , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million returned , 6 percent more than the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve from Z@@ acks investment research analy@@ zes analy@@ st predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked an@@ alysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in the international Pri@@ or shipping industry in recent years , which proved its revenues in its unity Express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales at the Bod@@ outs increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was essentially flat because of higher costs for major packages and health insurance .
the Express @-@ unit grew higher revenue based on higher prices , while the result dropped from higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the market trade , approximately one hour before aper@@ ture , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amoun@@ ted to 3.@@ 85 million , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide if it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the tail .
based on them at an end of the inde@@ xed , two @-@ stor@@ eyed se@@ wage system , a wall image of the United States resi@@ des .
the card is remember that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the large recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a failed third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight for them to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday as the U.S. economy is ready to be un@@ reconc@@ iled off the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
though most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the more cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen these vol@@ ati@@ lity due to up@@ lifting the interest rates for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that the labour market and inflation in first place will be the most important thing to observe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty concerning the global market enough justification , continues to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which secur@@ es itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloomberg , have predicted that week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicators that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increased the proposition , unless that the stro@@ kes increases the blow by promising that a further increase is far from .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ y@@ earning at 22@@ 8@@ 89 points or about 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy considers the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , boss with M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have to go very far in their explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they do not panic into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that an inj@@ ecting the financial markets would cal@@ med down the financial markets , because they would take the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set of 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first step in a slow @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ els had said in the spring and in early summer , despite the complaints from liber@@ als that would require more economic advance would expect an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation took constantly under the financial goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and requires them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , boss with Pantheon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world earned the end of the last month after China had been dispos@@ ed of its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ w@@ ess fell at more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % feared as investors feared that the slow@@ down of Chinese economy would increase the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles .
the market has recovered a little during this month , whereby the D@@ ow is at almost 10 % below the high value of May .
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market turbulent times influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events are not occurred in the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; said Mr D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he tells you that she will wait at least a month to better get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy &apos;s health is none of the chief an@@ ists of the co@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then head of Ben S. Bern@@ de@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be their monetary expansion &quot; narrow &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extingu@@ ishes around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being inter@@ tw@@ ined , they can not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts , to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has been linked to a story of transfer actions on financial markets , which apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
l@@ acker , per@@ missions a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates for an inser@@ tion of interest , aimed at decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia was bringing the F@@ ed to cut its head office to 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited recognizing impact on growth in the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ representatives made this cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification of 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings Sp@@ ati@@ fication of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il are not coming near this level , he said .
&quot; they certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they fear fear of an advance , because markets ex@@ hilar@@ ating , &quot; said goodbye , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should hur@@ ry the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
ever more refugees arrive in Germany on these days .
to prepare you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
these include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with one Body and soul Teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ oos , they are still instru@@ cted to lead them still .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
naturally , this is very different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazi@@ li@@ fication pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande supports food for healthy sle@@ e@@ ats
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clear the sho@@ cking way women about how important good nutrition is during the l@@ ac@@ tation . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , that are painted with fi@@ sts of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will get to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day .
however , a new research results indicates that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet are pregnant women actually protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new am@@ ber sports hall
the council of am@@ ber@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.@@ 3@@ million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar fl@@ ashes .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around on the Bern@@ au &apos;s sports area come step by step : in the latest municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated construction of construction worked out without major discussions .
previously , the Panel included a request for a civil law &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the permission for a special form of roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a &quot; Satt@@ el@@ d@@ ach &quot; is supposed to be built with non @-@ quality First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the umbrella space for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large sweet@@ ship together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it went again about the roof , for energy @-@ energetic reasons - different than those whose development plan should be set - among ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore needed , because the buildings should not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ber of the community is normally linked to liber@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
the costs are calculated at a cost of some 2.8 million euros .
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots promotion .
in the next process stage , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now submitted to the land @-@ centre for inspection .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed soon as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new Doctor of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees prefer to pull together with Sch@@ ong@@ au together with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of the district Andrea Jo@@ chner and White .
a decision on what is the super@@ visory board , however , and the conven@@ ing on the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would go to hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of solar with fishermen and the continued internal stop moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the collaborators who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , is said to be offered a work in W@@ eil@@ heim , says Jo@@ chner and White .
the employees are informed of their plans .
triggered the change of cancellation by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Doctor of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic only since the beginning of the year , and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should take the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ chner , who agreed to take over the lead , and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1st .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was a &quot; upgrading &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for core @-@ driven and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
passes for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the super@@ visory authority agrees to his team , when the super@@ visory authority agrees to both houses until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ ies , which shall have more than 35 beds , which shall be closed after nearly 140 years .
until now , the District Rule has planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing development is completed at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ it@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , res@@ ist the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , should be used in the possession of the Federal Constitutional Court , in the future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner thought I could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference @-@ psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what is better not to happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so fishermen about the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , which had been received positively and very intel@@ li@@ gible . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen has been working as pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian for over 30 years , I have not given it .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to adopt the job of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closing times over the past decades , and departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ lers of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lion is required at the Berg@@ ischen HC now in the evening ( 20.@@ 15 ) .
the leader of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is the clear favorite , occasion for pre@@ tension but none .
in the past season the bad@@ ener puts a pain@@ s at the B@@ HC a hur@@ ried defeat and have something to make up there .

refugees need accommodation : study warned against over@@ gap
the location on the German housing market is tense .
ever more refugees seek a paid b@@ lei@@ gh .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and jobs from the EU , more and more people are pushing on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ friendly citizens about the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , a 400@@ ,000 new units would need to be build up to a total of 400@@ ,000 new units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results will result in a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , in this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished .
thus lack of 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings .
in the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live for asylum seekers in an introduc@@ tory accommodation .
many then come across the apartment market and rows in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flat rentals .
according to statistical Bundes@@ amt , more than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market lies not only in the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany would like a deficit one ago , which is t@@ aller from year to year .
nicht löschen ! ! currently missing in the metropolitan areas are already approx . 77@@ ,000 units , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many experienced activities therefore dwelt in big cities not@@ ted in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained due to the cas@@ lau@@ ts at the apartment market un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meter per head has dropped again in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; social housing &apos; is propos@@ ing a new start .
in doing so , new incentives are to stimulate social housing .
thus , it could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the under@@ c@@ ops and the basic tax for funded apartments may be exposed .
furthermore , according to the Alliance attractive fiscal de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the funding program for refugee revenues from the Bundes@@ bank Kf@@ W is already fine in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday , with 184 million euros , more than half of the amount available to around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia leads corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no throw away , as ever more refugees vote the way about Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route yet .
Croatia wants to engage in neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the slo@@ ven@@ ian interior fashion , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country is not yet a Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the down@@ ward of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had gr@@ ati@@ ated its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws that occurred on the same day will make over@@ superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to make the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
yet , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
most of the media originate from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and taxi .
immediately after they arrived , they would have tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ west border the refugees did not encounter the border .
emerging from the border line other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ dek can now quickly create a secure gateway .
in Hungary after the closing of the border no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police imposed 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before the end of the trial , it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fies the overcoming and damage of the boundary to us as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the Southern French border of Sz@@ eged .
the condemned dro@@ ple@@ t pen@@ alties of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , you have taken out the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday that almost all of 94 asylum contracts , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the actors are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on the mit@@ one morning there were 40 refugees still left there .
practically nobody has a view to granted asylum in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers can be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ sit@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ ch , the workers began to stir .
it gathered the gar@@ bage , that tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks left on the road@@ side .
the f@@ laws were eliminated and one of the det@@ our in the border area was rebuilt .
in the purpose of this composition nobody wanted to express .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria is reaching a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants stopped working in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the statement of German authorities .
in neutral parties regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ran &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the show@@ rooms , when suddenly ten people were occupied with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ stein @-@ Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany ended on Sunday but because of the refugee stro@@ ms with Austria was surprisingly prepared for her in Wern@@ stein conclu@@ des , &quot; so the city which immediately began his help and the Gest@@ ran , together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au border .
previously , we first rented the indi@@ cted guests only once , with shou@@ ting and drink .
we said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; So the City of O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take away a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So Jo@@ iner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cleared @-@ pass@@ ers were jour@@ ne@@ yed on Saturday evening in Wels by a ICE into a regional train to Pass@@ au , to exp@@ ire it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to attempt over the border .
but the regional train has been de@@ posed before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neigh@@ bor on Sunday closed the day before a two @-@ brid@@ ging - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
for Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ ars to us , is a logical result of a great holy policy :
instead of helping to build structures immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor de@@ ca@@ vern@@ s fully informed the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
however , these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also must determine that the &quot; yellow &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , considering the continuing refugee streams and the near winter , with us to create decent jobs for protective seeking .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in Search of 3@@ 5.000 hiber@@ nation Qu@@ arti@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has given all hands to be dealt with in the hands of the refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has set up the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker to establish mer@@ ry for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial education centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without a great tur@@ mo@@ il , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State of the State said , on the other hand , was in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cryp@@ ted situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Konrad meets with an demand of 8@@ 5.000 mer@@ cen@@ aries in the he@@ ur@@ ing year .
to fulfill the number , must be found in the next weeks still 3@@ 5.000 accommodations - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 the Bund .
if there are more refugees we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a bott@@ om@@ less without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already made talks with the governor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have guaranteed to have been granted him even for the coming refugees dro@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it is going well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ M@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Scho@@ born , so that the Church will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations is the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helping them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
furthermore , it is hop@@ ed to be empty in the winter area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that odds should have to be adher@@ ed to a certain height of the wr@@ ist or height of the upper @-@ s .
for a temporary time must have to apply &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
he was more successful in keeping with his experience as opposed to the inside of the ministry .
I am an older gentle@@ man who cannot be said to face the un@@ truth without further notice .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they declared .
their number of employees want to increase it on three to four .
the own quest @-@ search results has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in office as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz does a better distribution
not the opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment as the people concerned are currently able to accommodate these measures , &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , more sites are to be tested for the case of emergen@@ cies .
the criticism of the city &apos;s committee shall be exercised by the number of refugees among the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not saved . &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bav@@ arian Minister President Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , President Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) held on Monday the further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further trip to refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there is therefore the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more involved in refugees from Germany to Germany .
however , the shelter would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for more solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria results again at its borders , is a logical consequence of the course of the Germans , for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock company group S &amp; T entered , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is supposed to be le@@ ased to young , innovative enterprises from the fields of technology .
&quot; in IT the clever heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later celebrate which barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which falls down in Nieder@@ haus@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T into the location of 3,@@ 3 million euros by the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is maintained by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as in the Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of resi@@ dual in the building have already rented , for another 40 percent there will be requests .
LIA @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the central point .
actually , Jutta wanted to set his dog at broad .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni , in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt Arctic : after all , she has now got her watch@@ man in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite to the business , in which they sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and skins from different manufacturers , now all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger pockets and accessories are up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop has been in operation .
previously , several weeks was being updated .
&quot; but I have long over@@ lays if I am supposed to open a store , &quot; says wide .
decisive for the decision was among other things that even the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of its own site , in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the cruci@@ fy in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their fashion interest has been widely received from her mother in the cradle .
I exchange them the most , when something developed and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
why so some woman with sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in cons@@ sing , can also provide the professional spouse not with last security .
perhaps it is because a nice bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for isolation .
whether he is expressed alien to journalists , journalists or knowledge in the international crisis policy - of the candidate of the U.S. presidential Office and the candidate for the US @-@ presidential campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Palat@@ ine K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate ac@@ counted .
the New Yorker with the F@@ U@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the winery at the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related via -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode .
the K@@ all@@ ure Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about their aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their cas@@ u@@ ity way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ ard commander has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ os@@ s@@ cap@@ es , at which in addition to Tru@@ mp , the ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; King of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
and he did not put it to the king of the hearts .
while there may be respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to be that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a big enc@@ ir@@ cling , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ na in the locality , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the An@@ ders , says it .
Tru@@ mp is therefore coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the late grandfather @-@ immig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for the min@@ er .
found@@ ational of the real estate company were first landed property in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from education : their desire to return to home in the long time , betra@@ yed the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once missed without permission , the director of the Institute for the Palat@@ inate History and People , Roland Paul , declared a movie start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that stands in contrast to the mit@@ o@@ cr@@ ushed statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about the Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a fron@@ t@@ wall to remove illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ der , that is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote kind@@ ter of tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was bor@@ rowed Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement may see the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so br@@ acing . &quot;
did he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never looked after a sound@@ track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension in@@ land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm included as some k@@ all@@ ots , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit to something for the church bar sp@@ ended , which was generally good .
&quot; I can not imagine the Donald not , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they do it better if he does not gain a choice , for &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had gotten the Se@@ eing at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never ever get there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; yes , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of Bu@@ to the Raf@@ ina Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama for a recently wast@@ ed father who un@@ ends himself with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million audience .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the giant Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the results of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and easily struck The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .

the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped into 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

mystery finally unveil@@ ed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may not know@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally lands , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three @-@ left girls will certainly not be revealing if it is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we are with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before out of three two , you may not acci@@ dentally have given a reference to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have om@@ itted on a ly@@ rical way about why wood is the perfect man and stressed his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could their answers to be destroyed by who won the heart of the Bachelor .
smo@@ av@@ ons rims and Mark@@ os@@ ki stressed both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relation with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and walked ( Sar@@ &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies was noticed , that she was pretty compatible and I expected it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she wrote Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the Ju@@ go@@ mon was last week its clear that wood &quot; of One can be .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m un@@ condi@@ tionally set on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who Wood was supposed , if not she , there it was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ F@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. , and there were many other teams to send inquiries after his impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some trainers would have running Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a little angel , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ se on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ n the next opportunity to a p@@ unt Return and also in the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continue to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of remin@@ ders his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team caused by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam Indi@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team regul@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who ri@@ ke him to forget his lost fi@@ ang and get care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a p@@ unt , who was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ F@@ L @-@ debut had hop@@ ed .
Hay@@ ne left behind the f@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ent in the playing field and told later the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ F@@ L career ,
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , one just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne missed the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the high refugee figures the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader of Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in the Grand @-@ Wal@@ ks in front of a serious crisis in Bay@@ erns landed , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools ahead of the collapse &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise , we will receive ampli@@ fiers in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the agricultural population of the free voters gave birth to Friday in the Lower Bavaria commune .
actually , completely different main topics were fores@@ een .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the Free voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum in clause &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger asked the establishment of UN @-@ protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we need to tackle the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apost@@ le@@ aning asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
for that reason , Ai@@ w@@ anger charges even more staff for the Board of Directors , who are responsible for asylum seekers , &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum standards , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
the F@@ W Chief is critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistently said : &quot; we set up nationwide standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in the Greater city shall not fall under the table .
a years of long @-@ term tor@@ ches remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ age Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot project of &quot; mid @-@ level plus , &quot; in which an extension of the g@@ ymnasium intermediate degree has been tested by three to four years - in the result , it will last nine years to the final secondary school .
but that goes far enough far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we call for freedom of freedom for all the higher level schools who want .

in the USA , the D@@ ow Jones index last around 1 percent in the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many market capital@@ isation expect the markets all the way up after the interest decision in the US and the large decay of the listed on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the loads from the Atom@@ ic erup@@ ted , has left the shares of RW@@ E to a record and also left deep traces at eon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy system perhaps lacks 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Government denied the numbers stated in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 per cent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by D@@ ax on top by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
according to a sal@@ es@@ man , a positive report by the US Open magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; will be released from the weekend .
therefore the investors of the German chip@@ bauer presents currently too little attention .
the investment in the promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be on the market for the investment .

Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used Tr@@ l@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before it goes back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were in@@ ju@@ red , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , from which it is known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently a high death rate produced .
the dispute was the last week of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i said that new provinces , which would be formed in the context of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ ou@@ ga , who want a state of their own .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent struggles since the 10 .
August , when the four major political parties had signed an agreement to divide the land in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been central for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 but the legis@@ lat@@ ure acceler@@ ates the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lat@@ ure have voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitution in Kathmandu and said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday .

project H@@ ieve : details are lying on the table
the planning for the cottage settlement on the Small Sea with Em@@ den take shape .
the investor created public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are more troubled - they fear the sale of their amus@@ ement .
monthly months had been ver@@ ted behind closed doors , em@@ n@@ ted , deb@@ ated , and drawn .
now , the plans for a new residential cottage on the Small Sea are close to Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ bar@@ ter company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee .

under the pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , Ralf Hu@@ hr@@ ung out of the System Factory construction management in the Offen@@ sive : &quot; we have not received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to deal with all rum@@ ors now .
it has been a total of about ten to twelve million euros , for months in the discussion .
violent responses under marine owners who came to the meeting were fav@@ oured the pictures and new details for the chosen hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member in the stakeholders of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this will be a big block , which is dominated by all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; besides , he fears like several other project critic , that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase greatly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are all bus dischar@@ ges to get that &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well a h@@ ect@@ are of the former host place is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have a concl@@ usive concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches a dou@@ bling pilot campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a duplication of money campaign that aims to bring 11 million US $ for humanitarian organisations , which ar@@ rests the thousands of refugees from the war , as they flee from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in disclosure of don@@ ating call on his blog .
instead of making a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our trip has many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people as my family are des@@ per@@ ately for help .
the funds go to four non @-@ profit organisations who provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be useful ent@@ lo@@ facial surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery could live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ data is a long time to tell something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama .
weight loss of sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity take various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 @-@ diabetes , but most studies have been performed with people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I from 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight and people having a BM@@ I over 30 are considered f@@ ett@@ led .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ ric bo@@ wel - to medical treatments for type 2 @-@ diabetes among people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those who under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I was with those who were not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were given roughly equal to 29 .
among those who are subjected to surgical intervention , at 36 % the diabetes disease is totally and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely only estimated at one percent , and in part with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general found better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers o@@ vers@@ aw the patient @-@ blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the researcher .
after surgery the average cell @-@ globe sank in A@@ 1@@ c levels from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how to reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - do not decrease the mortality in five years , giving the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
researchers team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 1.7 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and posted more a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefits of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that led to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to fat people who under@@ went an obesity surgery , roughly 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried out conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people having a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without higher risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone continued that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , they have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot pick up all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis began in the Middle East .
the Ti@@ be@@ tic Buddhist leader asked to end the violence in the refugees of Refu@@ ge@@ es .
the Dalai Lama was the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates ethics studies .
he urged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity , before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries ad@@ jour@@ ned to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , especially through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11th and realized that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quadruple increase in capture of wall disinfection by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swal@@ low alcoholic g@@ des@@ ci@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of manual infections in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison control centers report , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go up in emergency intake , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children det@@ ach@@ ers from disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants may only drink because of a cheap experience .
young people have re@@ mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be sc@@ aled from attractive no@@ zzles of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ted .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with earthquake , grapes and or@@ an@@ ges that are very pleasing for children .
Hän@@ de@@ dis@@ infections may contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children can already lead to the alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , the medical director of the Gi@@ v@@ ous Center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let go whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year girl , which recently taken four sp@@ lash that had taken part in school , was brought into an emergency treatment .
your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies in an adult as well as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ b@@ ted her words and wasn &apos;t able to walk when she came up in the emergency .
doctors said they overnight in a separate children &apos;s clinic in signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had himself the head was said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft products or the disinf@@ ect@@ ants from outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing were some disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with death waste .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario women after the si@@ p of hand @-@ infectious of a toxic , non @-@ toxic ingredient .
employee of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol fl@@ ates , is a deadly solution instead of eth@@ anol species , which was used as an active ingredient .
in January planned three students of the fourth class were in the State of New York , to det@@ oxi@@ fy their &quot; teacher &quot; teacher by creating anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so there is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them in their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the sec@@ uted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ossi@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dis@@ viewed academic activities to the school office . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t believe we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title Competition in the Scottish football World Cup - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation@@ alist of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic whenever there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here talk not just about the return of the ranking .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will be twi@@ sting the things around D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss is pregnant to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ ting from the Champions League , the defeat was followed toward 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , which stand now at the top of the table now with five points .
D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic had already bad times , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we must go on .
we really need the support provided by Celtic , because that makes the players better .
keeping it together is so important .

the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot;
the players that come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate themselves what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding an unnecessary player to the one you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it grows in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole was increased to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate from 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as demonstrated the figures of the office for National Statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland gave to 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell on 7@@ 4.3 percent in the course of the quarter @-@ average by 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ al commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has put the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I will be witness@@ ing a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later today , except in late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber of the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ ed@@ ged by the poison@@ ing .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first written in January about his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be allowed to see in the US , and since many more applicants are available as places , there is a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery in order to decide which is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is chosen will it be emo@@ tionally observed .
I cannot do it .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps and make my own relationship in the course of the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will get access .
I consult with it .
she adm@@ its that she would have better form@@ ulate &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong that I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t say to me what I have to write ; and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is helping the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a por@@ no@@ bility of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is composed next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have done .
I want to go here not again in all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no enough evidence to justify a fat@@ ness .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man of an un@@ necessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ am tried to att@@ acking him and to end the racing sports
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried , last year a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables to install and dro@@ w@@ ess to finish the race immediately .
he stepped onto the ste@@ wards and the integral section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ dress rehear@@ sal in Li@@ dar@@ i that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months on account of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age bracket and did not want to see that it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how to make up the bun@@ nies grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this and I have long spoken about it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything happens at once &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it is farther .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to be raised and I want my owners think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ative Department had tried to swe@@ ar its stable .
&quot; in the age of eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they certainly should get into their n@@ oses because they try to seize upon trying to seize me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ver , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of it and are still today .
should that bring me that there will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L engage in behaviour and perhaps makes people responsible outside coaches for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
maybe you have to take my license and ch@@ ased me , and I have no doubt that what I say to it now ?
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care for me , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit of the trainer of the trainer have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ finished master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ treatment usually &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack is mud or sound on the horse @-@ deb@@ ated , which was opposed to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has inherited mud on the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening to be .
it could have been the whole day just as it was .
it had also been so on the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who face these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has cri@@ tique of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favorite to the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators to the Twister player &quot; Ring@@ batt@@ ler &quot; with his team allowed during the high Storm @-@ winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly ev@@ oked note to the Storm team after his crew tac@@ kl@@ ed the Final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland did not be &quot; good . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentr@@ ating only on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ ally .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers of his team , I was confident , that it was so hard to worry about the Storm team .
&quot; this always comes up - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights , when they threw us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy in Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed in our defen@@ sive system or the techniques throughout the year . but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es about a real focus and that worked for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not losing acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny , as this happens over and over again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy , B@@ enn@@ et &apos;s idea was attacked by &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that B@@ enn@@ ette St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gon has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks about exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St. George was critic@@ ised as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team who can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the game of ball@@ ers , which you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play them like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago she probably didn &apos;t think of us as it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the Bron@@ cos for co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
you are taking our breaks and are no points a thing sp@@ ans ?
for me it is the schedules .
when they mention ourselves , it means that we are still meeting in a phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k at the next Saturday evening in the finals at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales starts at the next morning session .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit on drugs
a man who might be a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment threat@@ ens due to his dam , in the possession of 40 kilograms of ca@@ ine who were mu@@ stered to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police met 100 kg of the Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America about Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the sports harbour during the mornings and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of dru@@ ge in a Toyota E@@ cho .
despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the attorney from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the coffee could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter f@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; declared judgment on Wednesday .
when it was fin@@ alist , he lied the police with a place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs Mother and Sti@@ ef@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 Dollar as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the informative statements of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200.000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pro@@ f@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was un@@ locked against damages , under the conditions that he ab@@ ort his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , sur@@ rendered to the police on a daily basis and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg used by phone from girls to attract ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl , than this slept , logging in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later on and discovered that the phone was l@@ acked and found it in the hand of sleep Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the confusing news and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research , the terms used for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a polic@@ eman to make them sc@@ are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ ut@@ or E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he was addi@@ ctive to sc@@ are people .
he gave the search for the search performed on the computer from him , but said , it would be done because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to make pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the un@@ known person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said that he is sick in the head if he drinks , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and at the crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confron@@ ts the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who saw much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found himself guilty in the sense of indictment to have un@@ reported un@@ resp@@ ectable pictures of children on 14 June last year , issued on 25 January of this year against the decre@@ pit and did not have to be court hearing on 24 March of this year .
Secretary @-@ president Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg was not published in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , as we argue that &quot; no real sexual element &quot; may be found in his failure .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael made it the judgment of the latter to October to receive background information about social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted in this case , but were held in pre @-@ trial detention due to the hear@@ ings in other cases .

the mass makes it : every two years the motorway exit at the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly a movement during composers who are particularly well selling at present .
cars from the compact class are currently special in : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registrations falling out loud in August on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( audience , 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new upper and luxury cars are presented mainly many new comp@@ actor @-@ models this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be res@@ umed in the autumn of the retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra has an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra is not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the largest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
in addition , H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 horse@@ power to which for the first time also three @-@ cylin@@ ders of cylin@@ ders .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra has at first only as a fifth .
a second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also shown at the IA@@ A .
and what will be approached by the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A or new comp@@ acts ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only considered to be five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atic GT version .
in trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan group aims to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 horse@@ power .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment also is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 @-@ l@@ o @-@ tur@@ bom@@ bed and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s values in 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is available in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but all @-@ round is the compact model DS 4 , which is seen at the IA@@ A .
outside they presented the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ers above all hand in front of the front line : here the Cooler Master was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of kno@@ bs by a touch@@ screen reduced and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ play was integrated .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square @-@ meter cell are deser@@ ted
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authorities in law , which has been lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have basically claim to financial compensation , if they are accommodated in small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a vote on Wednesday .
the individuals affected may then actually hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional texts : he was accommodated in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel from June to November 2009 in a single cell composed of approximately five square meters floor ; the toilet was definitely not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his region &apos;s details turned back to an open leg , has been moved into a larger cell .
his ministers f@@ eit@@ ed due to the uns@@ killed prison conditions against the land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Jud@@ ge lifted the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and transferred the case to the renewed examination .
you will see the human dignity of the man .
Chamber of departure now decides on amount of compensation
even if legal reasons for the question@@ able period spent only a few days after the deadline be decisive , there was a lev@@ elling attack , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber must now clear the height of the money injury .
the Constitutional Jud@@ ge have often attacked the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
so they spoke out in April a prisoner corp@@ ses , because he was locked naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 , according to the multiple use of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had an in@@ mate at a Parall@@ el@@ apse in November 2009 for decent accommodation .
the then cl@@ äger soldiers had been kept from 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a like @-@ like cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were reported in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel in the head@@ lines .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggression , even to bat , it shall have already come for the tense situation .
after information on the rule of Justice , 21 points in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 shall exp@@ ire 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seekers , according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Law , to Germany come to Germany , after statement of vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany was able to absorb a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaking Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High@@ Step Pass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create that , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany convey@@ s the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the federal ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually - and over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 flats ) .
dramatically the lack of living space but especially in affordable housing objects : annually 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing dropped out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments will also apply to refugees too .
Prime Minister in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments yearly would have had to arise and that the federal government should invest a maximum of 6.5 billion per year .
they agreed to scientists and federal mini@@ stries that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , in Germany the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualification to help them critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees there is crucial if it can work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation at the reception company , but also for self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ en@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ res@@ hardt it has given a political shift : from the dis@@ agreement of refugees to recognition of work .
while it used to be a job ban for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residences .
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - most of the view have prevailed , so that refugees should be able to access the labour market sooner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is no conclusion on the offer of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs most frequently will be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ as@@ hardt of the Royal Road to Work integration .
the school administration has found that only a few inherited parents prevent their children in the kitesur@@ f , estimated at 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ ro@@ oting parents , Il@@ ja Ko@@ en says Ko@@ en , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung .
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distributed the management manual in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators will increase strongly by the big number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by allowing more trade nur@@ series .
in the countries are prepared for students without a German knowledge of welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ackers of the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or spoke the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
study visits could be made easier to access the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a where@@ ab@@ ed or d@@ ul@@ ary are given no services after the asylum seekers Act , if they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter is basically no BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ers .
patient @-@ tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be BA@@ Fö@@ G to be shortened from 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ ying rose to 15 months .
also this gap has to be closed , but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should give the same rights to Islam under the inc@@ eption , as it has the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches to develop into a new state of religions .
the establishment of a Islamic well @-@ welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to a clear and clear contact person , to cooperate with the state in many areas , and to provide some control possibilities .
in addition , the willingness to face challenges against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , spoke on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be entered into German .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more important in future than today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the majority of the majority society will have to change , elimination of discrimination and racism are more pressing .
in fact , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law since a decade .
but it learns very slowly , how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship showed , in the police and authorities to systematically ignored the rac@@ ist subject .
equal opportunities for all : what are migrant women organisations and stakeholders to have long demand for international agreements , such as anti @-@ racial counter @-@ violence in Germany , must become a reality in the next few years , when the country is peace@@ fully and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is capable of providing the expected refugees of medi@@ cally , says Nu@@ z@@ te@@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be drawn into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to equi@@ p all com@@ ers right at the registration health cards .
the performances could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
and above all , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalog edition , see the asylum seekers Act .
otherwise , the doctors above all do the language barriers .
already until now , the Berlin Health of Health and The@@ a Bor@@ de have shown that migrants are worse above their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ting charges would have to be taken , she demands .
a lot of refugees would be helped with more general medical care points out in the emergency @-@ patient emergency .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under refugees , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is going to deal with HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly other god@@ parents , German doctors came from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that concerns the anger life , either through the refugees too , even relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have been a highly developed educational system , several refugees or even doctors .
to practise them , however they would have to examine their qualifications and if necessary to test them again .
at least half of the refugees occur@@ ren@@ ces in Germany over the next millennium ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is mentally ill : the majority of people suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic loading disorder or using depression .
especially in@@ viol@@ ably were refugee fans , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU München demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee space is traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic loading @-@ depres@@ sive , is suffering from other things at so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ op@@ ies and death @-@ fear@@ ing .
further symptoms are bed@@ - and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , high const@@ ancy and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
yet until now only four percent of the mentally ill patients receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psychological ill asylum seekers in the welfare offices may pose a request for a psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months .
furthermore , in the social Off@@ ices are mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African el@@ dest leader , turned down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained intact , but the video of the Falls quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also reck@@ oned by alleg@@ ations of the opposition from the opposition to obtain anonymous death threats , and they had been warned about it , to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ams .
last month she had booked him and interrupted for his speech to the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions of SMS messages posted on their phones they warn against it , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ ility to inter@@ rupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members , that immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
the chief speaker said the party managed by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , be &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard is used up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up 25,000 to 30.000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings account of the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and its service activities .
the expected job market led to a load of more than 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing so far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ itted a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ let@@ t and Dave Pack@@ ard was founded to manufacture electric systems and the Palo Alto garage to &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to overcome the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech company , is the most recent in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused corporations provide better performance .
FC ar@@ senal - captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta said that team @-@ members have to stand in front of the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger &apos;s pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate kn@@ u@@ y infringement , and then back to his old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , who did not heal well .
it is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in combination with his dum@@ plings or the injury he had before .
this may be true of pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of other injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the examination of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is published 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ el in the last five seasons .
the wider picture of ar@@ senal is that it was in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have noted most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injuries rate during the last season will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a certain period of time when you strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and through it a career through the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on Wednesday , and turning points into a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of sur@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and to give players that need it a little car@@ ving @-@ off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ senal clear favour@@ ites are to return by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also tri@@ b@@ ated after 41 games after the &quot; Un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , being measured on the Ri@@ chter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that ar@@ senal of the last season has moved with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continue to lead from the distant hope , with its management to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close to this in 2006 but on the other hand I have long enough in business to realistic too .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fe@@ ast : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever has ever become , as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ show .
in 2013 it was the most important death penalty for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently stays in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ eg@@ ler Mis@@ er@@ sion ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of placing the culture in question , the men go on to seek help when they need it .
friendship is the heart of struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms set out that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of con@@ val@@ escence are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media sharing , with their emphasis on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear heavily , lively and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by that which psych@@ ologist extr@@ ater@@ al values call ; money , image , social status , all at expense intr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper understanding .
and like a video game , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that these focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which by the interaction as friend gli@@ stering .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments with football fans in cozy Ses@@ sions and the longing of R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came out of the knowing that men can relate to it , even if they often retreat completely to explore their feelings .
like a member of the telephone service I explained : ... &quot; my audi@@ tors &apos; role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are not endangered to me , has really shown me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows which comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective , out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone being able to help people in eyel@@ id the despair also likes , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hi .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to be mal@@ ign@@ ous
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his match against Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malmö .
here are the game report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani continued course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its champ@@ ions season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday started .
in Mary , less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut , the PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards he missed a number of occasions before she had finally increased their lead , than cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , also in the group A , Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the road to quarter @-@ fin@@ alist in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunity in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his home team and against the club with which he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and back safely , even though there are certain things that we have perf@@ ected in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we didn &apos;t find one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris team after its injury , in one of three amendments to the Paris team , who was able to hold a 2 @-@ 2 tie on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was spread out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine wing was educated as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he worked in Manchester United in the last month before Malmö . before he began Johan Wil@@ and finished beautifully into the long corner of the network .
if somebody believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , which was disappointed .
Malmö , which smote the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , came upon An@@ du@@ ff with nine national playing on the field and was s@@ acked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field , a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself was sometimes standing on , with some f@@ laws and bad outcomes , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five trials alone in the first half , and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani having started it .
despite this he dis@@ missed much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria turned into a shoot , which has been passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay stimul@@ us thus achieved its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had set up a left f@@ lange of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game and only an excellent input of Wil@@ m from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi identified a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ley , gave birth to that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that has not the same level .
the quali@@ fiers are not enough .
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi plays in summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
the FC Bayern stood obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back then for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion League , two times the champion of the World Champion , two times Europe@@ an@@ ei@@ ster , one time World Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer he left the FC Barcelona @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years in Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ying X@@ avi , so that he was already standing before the European Council before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid did that back then , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi wasn &apos;t inter@@ changeable
the change was not come about .
and the pi@@ vot@@ al man is working for the German record : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken a contract by Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P has said to me that I would not switch if he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; that makes me swe@@ pt . &quot;
who knows how the Bav@@ age @-@ season 2008 / 2009 would be running X@@ avi , 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against Bavaria about the whole distance on the lawn , turned the reds of ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated in the end the Royal Day triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays an array in film
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said , she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday Night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light the experienced actor Brown , considered this the need for alternative perspectives , stres@@ sing on a black prot@@ ag@@ onists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ulting and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian himself .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producing column Ben ab@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they handle the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is wh@@ ore that is be@@ aten by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio of the film ; it dis@@ proved that their leadership could give us something in the end what we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media introduced against dis@@ approval of the Dam@@ ons Com@@ ments .
Twitter followers Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO W@@ ISS that it does hurt . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et under@@ served more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 pubs since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion stands .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the motion had Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter land@@ en@@ nationwide effect and urged law@@ makers and regul@@ ators , discri@@ min@@ atory practices against far@@ er halt .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of tit@@ ular albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still Mat@@ ter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , even albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves have published a statement and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media fashion , who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .

all in a sudden ... as I can imagine not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the introduc@@ tory manufacturer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he first ended the par@@ cours not just any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said wo@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changed , he gets the great gra@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he swe@@ eps on it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
mass of distin@@ ctions received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by somebody , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac was just the way , when the roles have been dec@@ eived .

Detroit Tig@@ ers passed on to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , play this part however on Tuesday perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Tar@@ get Field .
the T@@ wins twi@@ sted a chance to climb in a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to write about a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vict@@ ories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad exhau@@ st .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early offensive support when Detroit was dot@@ ted three times into the first two sessions , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth day .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 internal and made possible three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I will specifically go down into the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s from the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Bo@@ er on 6th July .
&quot; he has be@@ got the whi@@ ch@@ on well . &quot; he said .
he looked good during ( impact ) , saw distin@@ ctly better off the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rounds at the end of seventh , the T@@ wins had the best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton termin@@ ates the inning with a double on the left field line .
the Right of Aaron H@@ icks reached a messenger and Simon brought his second bas@@ al Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ de Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy hur@@ ried wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted with , of the candidate @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Gran@@ t Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run at the Serv@@ ant Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of res@@ ellers and the finishing @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ hagen launched the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe for a double play .
it was the major event in the Major League for the 27th time during this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , the wall got a ro@@ ster double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed is S@@ ano at three pitch for his fifth time .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an yet non @-@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tiger accumulated in the first two classes on the first two classes against the right @-@ handed field , which had been delayed before the game from the viol@@ a list , after having been missing because of a back pain more than a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I have desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I get rid of and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ bands gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought together Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the Middle , &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right to manage another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second to reach a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not feel well be@@ aten , but he has the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , and had no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

Ischgl . German military measures in Syria an option
the manager of the Munich Safety Conference , Wolfgang Scho@@ inger , has military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute re@@ think about military action options should not take place without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &apos; collective &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the win@@ ch had gone to Germany with military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict landed in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .

Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced checks on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Presidency of the Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday morning at the Austrian television station OR@@ F , but after Hungary nobody will be returned .
also Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already en@@ acted in dialogue between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures did not call them and dis@@ missed talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have been coming from Hungary to Austria through the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far the EU states have not been able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers will take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) for a special meeting to take a new attack on the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees .
in light of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
this covenant will be made in collaboration with the countries , Angela announced in late afternoon discussions with the Prime Minister of the Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , those people who prayed to protect them as well .
but who did not have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany too .
this view was expressed in the round impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now be a &quot; enormous effort of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now been stuck on the Bal@@ can@@ Route .
Hungary had concluded its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later announced the government in Budapest , also the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , hundreds of thousands of migrants were reported on the road to the Greek border .

no diet fruit - man@@ goes included much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to take care of his sl@@ ender line , is often more de@@ pl@@ ated by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits still : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. Be@@ ar all included man@@ goes but plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta carot@@ ene .
those who e@@ ats the fruits therefore supports vision , immune systems and metabo@@ lic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the shell @-@ color alone tells nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so we can taste green man@@ goes very tasty .
they should be placed at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet foods .

first F@@ öhn@@ le , then striking front @-@ front
in the upcoming night , in the valleys of the Alps north@@ side of the F@@ öh@@ n , through , as Met@@ eo@@ Schweiz exp@@ ired .
on Wednesday and at night for Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n is partly fle@@ dged through the rock valleys .
after the Com@@ promis@@ ers on Thursday morning , we crosses a striking cold front which brings stronger rains , wind turbines and a temperature pull @-@ down .
as Met@@ eo@@ News is writing in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British islands in a strong south @-@ western river .
on the north@@ side of the Alps , the night is breaking through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday , tomorrow in the trou@@ gh@@ s with bu@@ ds of 60 to 100 km / h , are inter@@ connected and specially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the adjacent mid@@ site and in the mountains even organs of more than 120 km / h are possible .
during the north on Wednesday F@@ öh@@ n for summer@@ y temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture of moisture begins to st@@ ust down .
here starts rain , which holds until Thursday evening .
in total , the south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned over the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , that after the last days they have already lost large amounts of rain .
on Thursday morning , the hair tri@@ mming the air out , in the episode it is an Kalt@@ united front with vigor@@ ous , partly packed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind swe@@ pt heavily up to stor@@ my and the temperatures are going considerably .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther square .
almost 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Luther square .
in the presence of St. Ign@@ a@@ zio San Marino on Wednesday , a hitherto un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill were baptized on the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he will now be honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the study of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that the protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries ago could often only live in the secret of their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stood as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time a s@@ inner sin@@ king .
his negative impressions are likely to be encouraged according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther King had then introduced up the split of the Western church with his theses .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works called Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , that has now been published with colorful pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Old , which in 150 motives has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of Bible stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective topics adapted , that can quite seem rather ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar is worked at his Bible Project for which he met a subjective no@@ artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were formed cycles , which devote themselves to themes such as Cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity .
in this way he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther &apos;s publisher with his the@@ ological outlook , as well as the Kettler publishing company with its focus on art@@ books .
and that is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who diver@@ ge themselves on the basis of painting with the respective Bible writers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bi@@ av@@ mar of the Bi@@ av@@ ail of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bi@@ av@@ ail and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mir@@ rors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible from Martin Luther and one set of the artist who was in his own personal thoughts of the particular situation .
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equals twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions have ultimately been a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant sovereign reign of reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the education has been going on with the stock stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ tire this , in order to be able to carry me again with the Lord . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in a faster time ; &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds is today characterised by re@@ cl@@ ams and which is loud .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik will be displ@@ aced
artists have another desire and glad@@ ness , to show things .
images are always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar alt wants to let the viewer go into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost presented on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like as he understands his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care to grasp the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains just &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; arose , a images @-@ Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen tro@@ pics - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction of the BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , manager instru@@ cts , par@@ ables for a circuit tour : one year later it was finished almost anything - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was finished again .
failures in politics and administration , for ver@@ dr@@ ing , especially among the residents who don &apos;t want to tolerate the train .
thus hills seen above , new place sought - now with för@@ m@@ ly planning and application for building permission .
the approval was taken in October , the First District Apostle Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now share in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year has never happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be started with the work on the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundesliga team will join a poster in the weekend .
football responding to the coming situation in Germany and secur@@ es its policy its aid in addressing the problems at hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one can say in principle no one does say to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting to everyone to get this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
in the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the office of the Chancellor and meet the State minister in Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive woman there must be politicians .
the German Bundesliga team has therefore expanded its in@@ mate initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Well@@ come &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A workshop in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine represent a clear sign when it takes place on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ka instead of the usual Sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) to the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that all of them will help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Be@@ aches of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ knowing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama is every one that is not allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could swing Bundesliga team no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have been so incredibly busy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication play against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invite 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach presented the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements went into their own projects is great .
just as great that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for an Welcome to &quot; we spent in football is being lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will be jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , with 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in each case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coverage : SAP @-@ Stand E@@ ef now loses an eye in the accident
the Leader of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has left the left eye for several reports , according to a fall at the beginning of July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA he was midnight on a water glass which he took in the left hand , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost ver@@ ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , and then out of tow@@ ed into the street - he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ ki &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t might follow his work .
&quot; in early October we meet at the meeting session in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functioning &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software concerts .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader H@@ asso &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : any thing can happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you go down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Sp@@ are substitute Magn@@ ets except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ es t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te a similar photo and explained that he suffered the violation , as he was pl@@ ung@@ ed by the wheel .
therefore he comes at the afternoon in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ ire , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europe League will finally cr@@ ush .
the national player is missing the Bundesliga team in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga in Top@@ play against Lever@@ k@@ usen , &quot; the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el becomes his pedi@@ m@@ f not only on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the p@@ ke@@ eper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place by tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises at an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the soccer team the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future comes to use in all the Europa @-@ League matches , it allowed Ti@@ ch@@ el to be open .
with high probability he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ wards statement of fellow @-@ player Re@@ us that the Fin@@ alist minister must be the target of BV@@ B in the European League , holding middle @-@ campaign Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access the title &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the autom@@ aton IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated driving on driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 , which come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
the Concept Paper of the Transport Ministry , among other things emphasises the significance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid switching on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently taking a test track on the 9 highway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany aims to employ around internationally for the permitted maximum speed of self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government will also want to use the Vienna Convention for a change of the Vienna Convention which only sees man as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology mainly focuses on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds .
according to one of the research presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
however , vehicles on public roads were still expected to be expected only by 2020 . &quot;
added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 20@@ 25 to about 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the pel@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ police officer S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied , however clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ ensity is still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday on the AA pre@@ presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test @-@ organization DE@@ K@@ RA is acc@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to believe that only eight percent of the Germans believe that aut@@ on@@ ous driving cars will prevail in the coming ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all .
in France , 21 percent of the surv@@ eyed said to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet prepared to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a collection of digital , Bit@@ kom would only agree seven percent to release the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , that could be present in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , at the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would have left the car to control under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Tim@@ o the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bundest@@ ur@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Tim@@ o has also been missing and we are Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
there is a mix of quite big fashion show and a wax w@@ ns : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which are sc@@ ary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who has been involved with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the scene and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny , the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was so easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk ) to the Kuns@@ thalle the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the mo@@ des@@ pot has changed his initially temporary position on his person at the beginning .
actually , he had been against it , for : &quot; for me an exhibition a little bit after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly any previous work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed but it is an outstanding choreo@@ graph@@ ed total work for which much effort was operated : to indul@@ ging the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material have sc@@ aled the creators according to the statements of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to München .
just before the start of the October Revolution there was another special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ iter @-@ Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ cum@@ ene @-@ attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Ted@@ dy &apos;s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dis@@ mis@@ ses of fashion he got himself later on .
he sto@@ le the fashion stores and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later , I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to reserve the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it started on the long bo@@ ating machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were created in great abundance for customers , which they worked for example for ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , this alone is no longer working , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the jo@@ kes of Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze Fashion was played a major role , then has been displ@@ aced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt shows some examples : tip in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and on regional tra@@ its .
at all are the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion that breaks itself to past bul@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a growing total @-@ up potential .
those who are not cat@@ ers in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market .
with us , they are already making half of all orders .
B@@ ra@@ ke Pl@@ auen is member of nine further companies member of the industry @-@ association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry the proprietary label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the sales have been broken .
private trade and also the W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale is almost no more .
our products are hardly reachable by the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass ware , nowadays in the Asian region is made much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed through chains .
also strong , export , current to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries also to score on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer von der nitrogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we conduct a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially toler@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; that refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma @-@ design@@ ate U@@ te Schmidt currently teaches at the snow@@ y outside the West@@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in embro@@ ider@@ ies and shar@@ pen@@ ed .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there will be a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , which have to think especially economically . &quot; says Schmidt .
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly specific to maintain a customer base .
a couple of years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter became the historical snow @-@ tip .
the machine cre@@ eds in several places small ch@@ icks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ s@@ am @-@ Sch@@ wa@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate technique they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also delivers to the United States , to Australia and from Finland - especially to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and surrounding area and who want to rec@@ ess the rec@@ ital .
this way I see my jewel as modern ambass@@ ador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film
legends do not want to be touching , but Disney still lacks a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , not a new film , but a kind of continuation , playing with the magic n@@ anny for 20 years after the first movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with family B@@ anks in times of the World Economic Crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI is pushing to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open to the outside world for further growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group , which was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
real@@ ising new action and drive reforms , will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi &apos;an .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on regulating the market , relaxation and border controls , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the citizen &apos;s system .
after the statement , a negative list is produced , which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally state company environment and open the market open , commented on the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen up controls of the powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China &apos;s limits will allow China to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer , state controlled sectors to open , further areas for private investments are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and improve services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to request by optim@@ izing the requirements and application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee its activity , and the professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors to use , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as in a statement which has been published after the meeting .
EU wants to double Mer@@ cury num@@ eric value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers allow for a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the Consumer Trade Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which rules an appropriate working paper for the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects associated in pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt therefore ought to be raised the threshold values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ de or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram Mer@@ cury , per kilo@@ gram of fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly regre@@ ts with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold at the basis of the still existing limits for approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dou@@ bling of the limits , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irrever@@ sible .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to watch the limits on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram Mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch was doing it as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , like some car@@ p are mostly we@@ bit@@ ed so low that they already keep the planned top levels today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ge of distr@@ actions that helps alone the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mer@@ cury is a powerful machine for man poison@@ ous metal , which extends over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities particularly inf@@ ants can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Department of Commerce declares to its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum levels but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; may not be expected .
Mer@@ cury is obtained primarily by the carbon com@@ bus@@ tion into the environment .
according to a written request from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture , a written request from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to the Green Parliament , Ren@@ ber@@ Bar@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of Mer@@ cury in the year out , two thirds of the total volume in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March is quoted from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings before mer@@ cury in fish have already been counted among the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ um RA@@ S@@ FF .
