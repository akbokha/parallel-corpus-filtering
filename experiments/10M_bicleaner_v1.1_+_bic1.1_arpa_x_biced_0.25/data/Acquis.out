a reag@@ ent for blood @-@ group determination must react with all tested blood samples , which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g , or another on the label &apos;s label .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manufacturer recommended , such factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic characteristics ;
the Tit@@ er is measured for double the double in a suitable medium by ever .
the Tit@@ er is the re@@ iter@@ ative value of the number of the strongest ser@@ ge@@ al , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that should be used on object purposes , activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group@@ ing international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity will be worked at the time of standards .
according to the definition , a specific number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition may be observed regardless of the titles that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ists , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions with an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ acity .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture inside a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination are available for the international standard pre @-@ definition ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in the basis of the title of unknown reag@@ ent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO OMS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , such as the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B scissors according to the definition of 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge of the International Laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative Tit@@ ration of the International Standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , its required properties should remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form according to label is maximum a year after the final satisfactory efficacy test .
this is based on the label expi@@ ration date for dry res@@ agen@@ ics , according to the results of holding experiments ; it is gover@@ ned by state regulatory authorities .
drying reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container in which they have been dried and the so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ acted may lose at most 0,5 b.@@ g. of its weight if it is caused by further drying over phosph@@ ate pent@@ oxide at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied solv@@ ents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic used to continue the requirements of the added substance to specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human Orig@@ in for blood @-@ group@@ ing must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml .
the reag@@ ents , whether in flu@@ ent form or after recovery , must be transparent and must not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the international exchange for certain reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group@@ ing should not be colored as if possible , at least as long as not until a International Convention has come about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group@@ ing are spread in such a manner and in such quantities that this is not only sufficient for execution tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so large in a container that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy test described in this protocol .
the manufacturing facility has over all production stages and controls of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
reasonable samples of all reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory , until with some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ent processes used to contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary ai@@ ds to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and preservation of the reag@@ ent stability .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of their real estate .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
in each single container , a black @-@ and @-@ white label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , when dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the re@@ formation used required liquid ,
furthermore , this label , or label on the box , in which each container is located , or the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , when dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the re@@ formation used required liquid ,
every broadcast is included in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons of the group B which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A immun@@ isation .
anti @-@ A serum @-@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .

anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons of group 0 who can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gens A and / or B , i.e. those of group A , including sub @-@ groups A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gens A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
there are ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in general due to anti @-@ A serum from blood don@@ ors of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the Anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding compar@@ isons , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
it is also parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ g@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group coll@@ um or a corresponding comparison of the B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum also has a easily identi@@ fiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed in an object bearing with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , if the same tests are dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the Anti @-@ A blood@@ grupp@@ en@@ ser@@ ums or with a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate of equal activity .

if an anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed on an object bearing with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 √Ç ¬∞ C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each speci@@ f@@ ity can be one of two types , which distinguish themselves through the conditions , among which a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ated blood cells is achieved .
with others , which are referred to as &quot; in@@ complete , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids , such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers on object uses hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are curved in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of the Sera to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change when international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood type serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not included with human red blood cells that don &apos;t contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a ti@@ lt of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum can be dissolved in parallel to the same , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ ums or a corresponding compar@@ isons to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum can contain with blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , which are intended to use objects in accordance with the test of Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed up to 40 ¬∞ C. In 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination have to be seen within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not included with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Sera are therefore only specific to the C @-@ An@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are curved in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must amount to at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended to use objects in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed up to 40 ¬∞ C. In 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination have to be a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen e of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 vs. C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended to use objects in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in any form of anti @-@ D ) , have to be mixed within 30 seconds to have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be produced directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction of determined reaction conditions at the same time .
if an serum is intended to use objects in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time is intended to show a reaction in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not inferior to the ant@@ agon@@ isms antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of group A immun@@ isation .
anti @-@ A serum @-@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , the A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of the blood groups A and AB , including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there is no human blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the Anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding compar@@ isons , separated with floods of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object bearing with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent water flow , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt is carried out with the recur@@ ring , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the Anti @-@ A blood @-@ grupp@@ en@@ ser@@ ums or a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate equal to the same Avi@@ d .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , the B an@@ tigen , that means those of the blood groups B and AB ; there are ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group coll@@ um or a corresponding comparison of blood cells of the group B to ti@@ tri@@ cky ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object bearing with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt is carried out with the recur@@ ring , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard pre@@ par@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard pre @-@ par@@ ate equal to the same Avi@@ d .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood type ser@@ ology must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against comple@@ mentary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are immune to the injection of human serum proteins .
