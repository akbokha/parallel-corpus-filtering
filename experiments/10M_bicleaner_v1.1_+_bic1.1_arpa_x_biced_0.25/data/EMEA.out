Abi@@ li@@ fy is prescribed for treatment medium to severe manganese episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection @-@ solution is applied to rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral medicine is not possible .
these diseases can be used to take the solution or the melting tablets in patients , which the swal@@ lowing of tablets has been used .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transfer between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene means such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a less@@ er extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder can play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ emerge .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , re@@ emergence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by up to one year .
the efficacy of injection @-@ solution was compared to 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and Placebo , which have been resur@@ rec@@ ted to 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ solution was diagnosed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , who suffered from gest@@ ed rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients underwent a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body re@@ acts the melting tablets and the solution to take effect .
in both studies with injection solution showed patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduce the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ ring of Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased slightly more effective than placebo and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , inf@@ ath@@ ic acid ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased memory ) , drow@@ sin@@ c@@ ation ( increased memory production ) , fatigue , exhaus@@ tion ( increased ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe episodes of patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and with whom the lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , compared with the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection @-@ solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate to su@@ stain the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the auth@@ orization of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode shown in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages of 15 mg dosage was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to greater sensitivity of this patient @-@ group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justi@@ fying this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours belongs to mental disorders and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene should be applied to treat patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ eration : in clinical trials , which one year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
if with an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty occur , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of history or at states that are related to caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene to placebo in comparison to placebo .
there were , however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer &apos;s dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and appeal for undes@@ i@@ rable events with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ al or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic fluid materials , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic fluid @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene to the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene is used in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective drugs with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma levels of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should potential benefit the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ ac@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ ate / 3 @-@ methodology xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
due to inadequate data base to humans and due to the concerns of animal studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential is justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , the patients also should be warned against other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of listed side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled term study about 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo controlled term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes for Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was diagnosed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally important differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in clinical trials and since the market launch an un@@ inten@@ tional or estimated super@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of a su@@ do@@ zation of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene has a high plasma binding .
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a presses .
Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene revealed a high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ ors as well as a fresh aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and the hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg , the Pos@@ it@@ cartridges @-@ E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one of the Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study , 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities , which included a response to the study medication , were similar to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement that were defined as secondary studio species , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene revealed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene group and 57 % under placebo .
in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene showed a placebo superior to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer &apos;s patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene showed a placebo superior to placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to a week of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental features that partially spread over 2 weeks , the companion of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 . in a placebo controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene had been superior to placebo during a stabil@@ ising period prior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar shift , predominantly in the prevention of a retreat .

there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic features of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure , compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw hits on their metabolic capacity .

in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer &apos;s patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , which was compared to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the relation between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max means value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
in addition to a consequence of the dose of sul@@ fate of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in the G@@ alle von Mon@@ keys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is 1- up to 3@@ times the average price dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits , these effects after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose was observed .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ tion@@ ment solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ gi@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ ings in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene should be stopped , and using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
to minim@@ ize the reset and minim@@ ize vari@@ ability , a injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may vary depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the pharmac@@ euticals or acute therapy before being used ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene injec@@ tions in patients with ag@@ gi@@ ance and behavi@@ oral disorders that caused differently than schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene injec@@ tor can be considered necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme conditions or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene injec@@ tions are not included in patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( caused by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene should be applied to treat patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ d@@ ration ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ eration : in clinical trials , which one year or less di@@ gest@@ ed , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ves , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dan was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , in a study , in healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ( 15 mg of dose ) , and that were intra@@ muscular in the same time ( 2 mg of dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma levels of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ A prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , can have similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age height before the start of the accompanying therapy .

in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ or or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental features that partially spread over 2 weeks , the companion of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene compared to placebo in respect to the prevention of a bi@@ polar shift , predominantly in the prevention of a revers@@ al .
the Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; System@@ ic exposure was similar between both sides .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma thickness in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene injec@@ tions was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkey , and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target range after repeated treatment with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .

it should also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ numbers in the blood before the start of the treatment .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) states that Abra@@ x@@ ane has been containing more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing the first treatment , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs , it has to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited to the Abra@@ x@@ ane company in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and not shown for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine in @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
for sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to break down to a level of 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no clinical studies carried out with patients suffering from kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an album @-@ related nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ul@@ ating of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be depos@@ ited and symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient should not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thri@@ ll count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a substantial content of Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been detected in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac inci@@ dents in inde@@ xed patient collective does not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
in case of the patient following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these may be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tika and con@@ sti@@ cking means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not practice at pregnant or pregnant women , who do not practice an effective conception , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible .
women in the age @-@ able age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane to apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , during and up to six months after the treatment is no child .
male patients should be advised to advise treatment over a sperm , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( often ) that can affect the traffic light and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ing , Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the adverse events are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a monopol@@ y at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ inine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease :

pain in the breast wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , gen@@ esis , pain pains , muscle sp@@ as@@ m , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , f@@ lange pain , dis@@ comfort in the body , muscle weakness Very frequent :
Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ yst@@ 1 The prevalence of the sensitivity actions is calculated based on a final in connection in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no cog@@ nitive connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing of their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bit of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital intervention and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ocy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components are medi@@ ated in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ax@@ el promotes through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ tran@@ eous transfer through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( p@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two ar@@ dy @-@ blind@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received all 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion of prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a reduced general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy of a periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy grade 3 .
the natural development of periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy to sound base on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active ingredient composition ( AU@@ C ) rose linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off to multi @-@ phase ways .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extended ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft connection by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solv@@ ent half @-@ quality pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) than after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily based on 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ad and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative action was 4 % of the total dose of less than 1 % of the metabolism 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ax@@ el , which points to a vast non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
in the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packing tape . • With clear display of correct use of the product portfolio for transport through patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological drug is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference holders &quot; ) .
patients with normal blood fer@@ rous use is used in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with illness , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to take a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his co@@ eli@@ tist , if they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ations should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ or in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or patients with kidney problems can be caused by an@@ emia by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or by which the body is not sufficient for the body of his own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , compared with the reference agent .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks at least eight weeks before they were inj@@ ected either on se@@ amed or continued to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the project period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were inj@@ ected with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to abor@@ tions , were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side @-@ cra@@ tive headache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug was provided for se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which makes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical specialist personnel in all Member States , including information on the security of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg granted approval for placing of se@@ wer@@ amed in the entire European Union .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ inn@@ ate patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and fol@@ ks may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical development and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins around more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
due to vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed on or under hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets .
given these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is 25 % reduce .
patients should be supervised close to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ ese symptoms .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher earnings in patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher earnings in patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical development and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
given these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be supervised close to ensure that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value for at least 1 g / d@@ l ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the u@@ ticul@@ tur@@ tle number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be maintained at 150 / kg each week or 450 that / kg each week .

clinical studies have observed an elevated mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular diseases when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given to a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is attributable to the control of an@@ aes@@ thes@@ y@@ symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically corro@@ sive cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to present recognition , the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
in HER2 patients suffering from ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may be trans@@ fun@@ med ) .
if the h@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted to possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 ) treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapies ( see section 4.2 ) treatment with the goal to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in patients who should also consider specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the start of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia were examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ take a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in the basis of cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that for patients with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting sh@@ allow@@ ance value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not been demonstrated that in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , the overall survival or the risk of tumor is dimin@@ ished .

if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break off your therapy with ab@@ out@@ amed and define how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the death of dying could be increased .
in increased or increasing cali@@ br@@ ating , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium values are back in the standard range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust cover by in@@ sufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation does not exceed certain value .
according to the present recognition , the treatment of blood pressure with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al weakness ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ zed , does not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of eff@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adapt your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood pressure ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) possible .
this risk should be derived from the advantages of the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ge@@ och@@ rom@@ atic or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and influence the tumour to affect the tumour .
if you imp@@ ose a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the treatment of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before treatment of an@@ emia .
if your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ out@@ amed because an elevated risk of blood drops after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines / apply / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ osing the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) for building the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV .
depending on how your blood@@ arm@@ ut ( an@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will present regular blood tests in order to verify the treatment success and ensure that the drug works correctly and did not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
once you are working well , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 / kg twice weekly , spread between two equal injec@@ tions .
your doctor will present regular blood tests in order to verify the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ emia speaks on the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks , until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treat doctor will conduct regular blood tests .
if necessary , the treatment time before surgery can be shortened , a dose of 300 i.e. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before the operation , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your physician keeps this for appropriate , also learn how to spl@@ ash yourself under the skin .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone spr@@ inkl@@ ed ) both in women and male men@@ opause .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tal risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who have suffered a little trau@@ matic boun@@ ce as in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle .
administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta is attracted to the ass@@ ort@@ ment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
for the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hips over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme which builds bone substance ) in the blood once again or by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other O@@ steopor@@ osis edi@@ cs ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 out of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors that apply A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients who are explained in which the medication side effects are explained and pointed out when they should apply to the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run@@ time period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advised on patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient @-@ group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose @-@ adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 who are missing data for un@@ question@@ able and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are only limited clinical experiences for these patient population .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid adjustment of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ under symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advised on patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

kidney dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions that expressed as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cancer ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study at O@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cancer within 10 days after the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ations of calcium ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , below 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area was especially reported in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ sis ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .

in case of an over@@ do@@ zation that leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , it can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone element or a BM@@ D score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing flu@@ idi@@ om tin@@ c@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate effects compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a rejected a lasting effect on three years that resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ins , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .

treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the starting value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
impact on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in the total th@@ igh and scra@@ pie as at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led about 24 months compared to placebo treatment in an increase in the BM@@ D increased by 5.4 % to the tot@@ als and 4.3 % on the scra@@ per .
clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon R@@ FT study were randomised to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study of CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once a year compared to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months .
clinical efficacy of the treatment near Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 . effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain management was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as a response ( on the therapy had been addressed ) could be taken into a retro@@ observ@@ able phase .
patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 were treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who were treated at the follow @-@ up study , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , compared with a median duration of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of contin@@ ous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ing independent .
after that , the plasma levels increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0,1 % of the maximum value .

if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding placebo ( for undes@@ i@@ rable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ i@@ rable effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng At the assessment of side effects , the following items are basically laid :

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Library Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explained how the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to discuss recommendations on the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • Es ( mon@@ otherapy ) can be used in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) cannot be used . • It can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ medicine medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ur resin , or insulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ae and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ ur resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar levels decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy were examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ li@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ u@@ rea production in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , the patients receiving the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , compared with the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving in addition to placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to friction ) .
acet@@ one may not be used either in patients who may react sensi@@ tively to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ ones - acid in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to provide an approval for the office of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and in@@ appropriate for contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose infin@@ itely variable .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , however , was not led to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels increase up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ values are as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms that hin@@ ts on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , degra@@ dation , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the incident of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment should be carried out .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases linked with fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ or@@ el@@ ution in therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a lower reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins around 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins um 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consists of oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur resin , or as a double combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , above a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a deteri@@ oration of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but de@@ file doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological ab@@ norm@@ alities should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ rable events regarding bone bro@@ kers from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated fra@@ c@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 questionn@@ aires in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 870 ( 2.5 % ; 1.0 cargo ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 female patient ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient is willing to wish for a pregnancy or enter it , treatment is ab@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on have no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ y@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines referred to by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is estimated that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on that reduces hyper@@ insulin in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in the mother &apos;s pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the width of the lens , as they also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ gra@@ dients occurred on three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as compared to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch was rarely reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history .
there was a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ xed randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative groups .
during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator or Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R ) ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has continued to be over two years to investigate the time until after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( over 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo controlled study on 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate , despite the three @-@ im@@ on@@ ary optim@@ isation phase , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction in the insulin injec@@ ting in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves showed a statistically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks post@@ ural analysis of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and slightly , however clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decreased values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the sober tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved over a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , and also on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized to either existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on becomes fast res@@ or@@ able , with the peak concentrations in un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ y@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma cent@@ ration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ ers were found mainly in the fo@@ xes ( 55 % ) and found a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , lower than in healthy volunteers , but resem@@ bles the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of Mother &apos;s sub@@ stance .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration Plas@@ ma@@ ins @-@ En@@ forcement with hem@@ at@@ lution , an@@ emia , and reversible ex@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is estimated that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on that reduces hyper@@ insulin in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance to the parent &apos;s body and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ theli@@ um .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was investigated in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar , as strongly as with another human insulin .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who possibly have to react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) on human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted to , if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to take the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that the advantages of acet@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes would be overweight .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to provide an approval for the supply of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast @-@ initiated effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
injection @-@ pin must be loaded in the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients who have significantly improved blood sugar levels , for example , can significantly affect the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ effective , bi@@ ologic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNS on insulin of animal origin ) can cause that a change of dosage is required .
if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required if the patient is necessary , it can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal insulin had occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia had less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin .
in particular , the patient should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can carry out that insulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively .
the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy , and his patients are still in@@ ferred to others of them .
4 Un@@ less hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , which may occur at a non @-@ controlled Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other parts .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adapted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can influence on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to provide an approval for the governance of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be re@@ ared , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin .
3 If moving to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose adjustment is required , these can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion is necessary .
in particular , the patient should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can carry out that insulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively .

the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 1.5 @-@ 3.5 hours and the entire time is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ances , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plaster notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ alli@@ ances that can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damage ) .
if the u@@ rea amounts to two or four weeks still more than 6 mg per dec@@ iles , the dose can be increased to 120 mg daily .
during the first treatment months , inci@@ dents can still occur ; therefore , patients are recommended for at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , further medicines for the prevention of gre@@ asy .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( p@@ seudo @-@ medications ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of Hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary aci@@ d@@ ration was under 6 mg / d@@ L in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients suffering from Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of the patients who once daily intake a u@@ rea production in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with cor@@ di@@ ments in history , there may also be an elevated risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic Hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in disorders that have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the patient &apos;s history known or currently present con@@ no@@ des and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ aci@@ dic su@@ ction after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still available &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and teenagers have no experiences yet with children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

liver diseases During clinical trials of phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
therefore , before the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ utory treatment and further development , depending on clinical development and other liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no exchange studies at Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ Tim@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhi@@ bit of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ or ) .
at test subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily is associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at or the same active ingredient is required .
in a study with subjects worked 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak cost of the effect of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of an ant@@ aci@@ d@@ um , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , which is delayed by Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies can not end to side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxes of a vehicle , to be careful from machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not affected their performance .

diarrhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies there were no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity actions .
7 Open @-@ time extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 906 to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treated events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data .
the following treated events were either reported either in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or at a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study like below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly ser@@ um@@ ber acid ratio &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were included .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a serum levels of study ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum levels of study at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) in regard to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were conden@@ sed for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg .
the lowering of the serum respiratory system at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and maintained permanently across the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ or@@ bit@@ ing values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al limitations on the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clinical significant differences in relation to the percentage of serum concentration in the patient , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ acid concentrations of 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of arthritis ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a barrier @-@ feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gyp@@ sum size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of gre@@ asy notes up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma percentage ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at after administration is simpler and multi @-@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ ing proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration was observed when this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration range that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative metabolism are formed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ . 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 origin@@ ates .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C market , Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at found approximately 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine there were also about 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ate ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney failure - after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , medium or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ Tim@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 m m@@ g. h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 m ( h / ml in the group with severe kidney function ) .
12 liver function restriction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) of liver function restriction changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C by Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to AU@@ C by Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ ity In male rats , a statistically significant increase of u@@ bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , with about 11 times the ex@@ position of the human exposure .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic rate and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , approximately in the amount of 4 times the human therapeutic exposure occurred , maternal toxic@@ ity came up with lowering the lowering performance and a development delay with the offspring of rats .
ter@@ atology studies in tra@@ jec@@ ting rats with ex@@ positions that were about 4.3 times and with tra@@ its rabbits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , had no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at or the same active ingredient is required .
diarrhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies there were no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity actions .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are hat@@ ched ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not take place until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 is already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company used data to come from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to investigate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were only al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data on the fact that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive devices such as abdominal pain , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( swal@@ lowing ) , tri@@ mmed abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed belly ) as well as aci@@ dic walking .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against ageing , vitamin D3 or any of the other parts may not be used to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied to diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ orie levels ) or in patients who can not stand or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications have to be precise to reduce the risk of elev@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients are supposed to cut the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place in front of the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical intervention in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , only be given under particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) .

the doctor should be attentive to all signs and symptoms that hin@@ dered on possible ös@@ opho@@ bic reactions , and the patient should be pointed out when the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or re@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious cont@@ act@@ less adverse events seem to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point to an evil irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are given to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

clinical assessment by the treated doctor is crucial for therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the patients will need to depend on taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their sow@@ ing .
they should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned for the next week of the week .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interventions were not performed , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials in cooperation with a variety of usually absorbed drugs , without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not able to apply during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients who transplan@@ ts a kidney or liver in order to prevent a decrease of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer is already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with programming / programming and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Ad@@ vaginal met with programming / programming or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients , with which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of a year ( for example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and exam@@ ines how Ad@@ vaginal met in comparison to programming / programming of the body .
tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rho@@ e ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other parts may not be used .
patients and physicians must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Ad@@ vaginal raf , since the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the same drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tations , should pre@@ arrange this medicine or take changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the respective daily dosage ; Modification of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ igen control of one in transplan@@ tation medical devices ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains unchanged .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of depreciation and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below )
after conversion from Progra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was measured as the level of tal@@ es , both with both sides of kidney stones and in transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ ons are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .
in case the condition of patients in the first post @-@ operative phase cannot allow oral medication , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of the genital Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustment can be necessary later , as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ising the patient after transplan@@ tation .
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t detection of the oral Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be converted to a daily intake of Progra@@ f capsules at a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . thus , this change@@ over in relation is 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a change@@ over from other Immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must start treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis .
heart transplan@@ t in adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vaginal , is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day .
other gra@@ ft receiver , although there is no clinical experience with additives in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , at pan@@ kre@@ ast@@ ral transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for application .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood@@ lines in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function can no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular basis of the serum concentration , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over of c@@ ic@@ rid por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the conversion of a c@@ ic@@ rid por@@ tin to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood . the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shock absorption and toler@@ ability in the single drop of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to carry frequent controls in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion from programming to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dose adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
because Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials insi@@ sted that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the blood level cannot exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tac@@ kles levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with ren@@ al and hear@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t and other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the respective daily dosage ; Modification of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ igen control of one in transplan@@ tation medical devices ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t shock , which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as therapies , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t of transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , and transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents are not yet in clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vaginal raf .
due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a detection of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the cur@@ rant body ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is contained , or other plant nur@@ ture during a treatment with Ad@@ vaginal raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in these circumstances .
in rare cases , as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e was observed , which can therefore be found under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure , and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to suitable clothing or using a solar control factor .
if patients taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of pre@@ s such as headache , changed consciousness of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should be a radical investigation ( e.@@ g ) .
da Ad@@ vaginal sex capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ants , lact@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase @-@ deficiency or glucose @-@ lact@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of pharmac@@ euticals or herbal medicinal products known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ - blood levels in simultaneous treatment of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was made with tim@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluor@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ ather@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing of gastro@@ intestinal pollution .
highly dosed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute exhaust transactions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with pharmac@@ euticals , which can be metabolic by CY@@ P@@ A4 .
da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive , and thus increase hormone exposure , is particularly cau@@ tious with decisions about recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on , and extend their semi @-@ value .
the results of a minor number of examinations in transplan@@ tations provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , an elevated risk for undes@@ i@@ rable events in relation to the course of the pregnancy and the result of pregnancy .
during u@@ ter@@ o exposure , there is a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns to possible adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cali@@ a@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants can often determine because of the patients and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK @-@ virus associated neph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive Leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vaginal raf .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ last@@ y including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zing .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ical protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ate @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transfer because of the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular range of lymp@@ ho@@ ur@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us inhi@@ bits the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the T cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

published findings of the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of two primary organ transplan@@ tations , has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant to pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 people transplan@@ t patients with 4@@ 75 patients had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 630 cases after a intestinal transplan@@ t was used as primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral programming was published in these published studies in the large study , in which program in liver , kidney , and heart transplan@@ ts were used to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
data transfer transplan@@ t in an intermediate analysis of a recent survey conducted over a recent survey was reported above 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
also a chronic transplan@@ t shock , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , was treated less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year amounted to 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ rid por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ ine ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute transplan@@ t sur@@ ge , after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) , and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study carried out in 205 patients who were treated simultaneously with a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation , which received a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ ine ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per Protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the targeted valley mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric study showed in 155 patients ( 65 only gut , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ mic transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated over@@ life rate of 75 % to 1 year , 5 % to 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods used to detect Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ aug@@ mentation , additional initi@@ ation of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ists , lead to tal@@ es between 10 and 15 ng / ml and the latest transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ulation value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the untreated faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed higher clearing rates .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was reduced in stable patients ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than 10 % lower than programming .
it is recommended to carry frequent controls in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
21 For treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t shock , which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure , and oils .

advances will be used for treating bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by lack of factor VIII related , con@@ genital bleeding disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application apply to whether it is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A is caused by a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human line factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ise is approved by another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , however , is different , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A study , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of advance in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ tic sep@@ sis was awarded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advances must not be applied in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against human rights factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to provide an approval for the office of records in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution for the sub@@ stitution of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gel , after the place and the extent of blood pressure and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity will not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ments are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the danger passed by the patient .
during treatment , the controlling dose and frequency of injec@@ tions are an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different sem@@ ination periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long@@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ h will not be achieved or if the blood is not gover@@ ned with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to investigate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be drow@@ ned .
the appointment should be set after the patient &apos;s request , with the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial activity of factor VIII &apos;s immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent within the first 20 ex@@ position stage and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , according to conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the resur@@ gence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients in the patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated inhibit@@ ors ( 5 patients ) , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) . the unexpected waste of blood cl@@ ots factor VIII ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) occurred during a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained during all time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE of 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) just a patient after 26 Ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE reached a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE by factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statistically significant upward trend towards anti @-@ CH@@ O cell @-@ protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that occurred to an allergic reaction or sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes were reported in several repeated product positions in the study .
7 As for other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported on more sensitive skin reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency unknown ) .

based on the data available , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the value risk provisions as a positive result , but in consideration that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored .
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply further extension procedures for 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) officially with that the company is continuing its application for the marketing auth@@ orization of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , bone or soft parts ( tissues , which links other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a sort of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus &quot; that has changed so that there is no copies of themselves , so that no infections can trigger in human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body of the existing p@@ 53 gene , normally we@@ ars to restore DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , if the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can further grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ strate , in bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP requests the answers to the questions presented to him , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the testing of initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP sent to day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors bring advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the security of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in may be manufactured in a reliable way , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in direct contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP doesn &apos;t matter whether the withdrawal for patients who currently have clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chang@@ ed Re@@ action &apos; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours .
aer@@ op@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ g@@ inal surgery ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective dimensions were the changes of the hypo@@ cr@@ o symptoms that were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary covering a standard sk@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of all hypo@@ cr@@ ite symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported that Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income reported about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under aer@@ op@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( severe pain ) , an@@ op@@ ulation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ op@@ aze may be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ op@@ aze also should not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glaucoma ( high eye pressure ) , cardiac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ self ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid disease ) or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strokes .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to provide an approval for the transport of Aer@@ op@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break , break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under 12 years due to mis@@ fortune and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after removing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in time .
after decl@@ ining the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breath , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may continue as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity for combined use of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ants such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , l@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which are applied to per@@ oral or nas@@ al as secre@@ tion of Rhin@@ ology , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data is not sufficient to send recommendations to the dosage .
safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to send appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the patients have to be informed that the treatment at the onset of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of palm @-@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a gain of head@@ aches ) must be depos@@ ited .
in the treatment of following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents under digital is patient ( patients with hypertension ) patient with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of history , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder semi @-@ instruction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines could reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used , however , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo were detected , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme has not been identified so that inter@@ actions with other drugs can &apos;t be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ strate of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ comprehen@@ sion of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , yet with a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and based on vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ving properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be used in pregnancy in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible surfaces .

CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as At@@ roph@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ate P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective tolerance or tasks that are associated with flying .
in clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of sl@@ um@@ ity was observed in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ing or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine agon@@ is@@ tical efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets was determined based on the total score for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al mu@@ ck ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the weak@@ ening effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy associated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the equivalent of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin badly damaged .
a component analysis study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine following the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional studies for security analy@@ tics , toxic@@ ity in re@@ peti@@ tive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ality , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not realize special dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally consistent with the active ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in .
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine used in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ ato@@ v .

for children aged between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( among them four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of qu@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after a six @-@ week treatment .
further studies were submitted to demonstrate that the body forms the syrup , the solution to take @-@ up and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % for patients who received a placebo .
in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo treated patients compared to placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who possibly have to be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe offering a approval for the office of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should end up according to the previous disease and may end after the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed .
in the Persian @-@ allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergies time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not intensi@@ fied by the effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , considered in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that reported more frequently than in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ate P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective tolerance or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ zing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as the result of the total value of life for life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us dimin@@ ished the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the eti@@ ology are similar to different forms and chronic patients can be easily controlled .
since the hist@@ amine release a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected , besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of primitive symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine , were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ant , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , which were comparable to patients with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no evidence points for a clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs are not excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ strate of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fat , low @-@ rich breakfast ) is not included on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin in a compar@@ ably degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxic@@ ity fil@@ s of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ able gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ality , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not realize special dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals in relation to symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the tax@@ ed doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us support .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examinations , and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin reduced and experienced a higher sub@@ static load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabolic metabolic is identical , is identical with children , the normal metabolic .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ sh@@ em@@ sis or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not intensi@@ fied by the effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us syrup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported on the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ indo@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children can be extra@@ pol@@ ated by the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin when adults are extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days in adults , not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
clinical trials recommended for adults and adolescents at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were carried out in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for any imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , alcohol was not affected by the simultaneous consumption of alcohol , nor to increase the alcohol @-@ induced power increase .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as the result of the total value of life for life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased effectively by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
the prolifer@@ ation of this restricted phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ul@@ ating in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , the metabolic syndrome .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 3 to 6 hours about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no response to clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies show that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ os were comparable to the recommended doses of recommended doses by adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs can &apos;t be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us syrup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ las@@ i with child@@ proof polypropylene connection cable with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once take daily in the mouth , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the Bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ats will be taken to take away without damage .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were used in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which were used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vitality signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of sl@@ um@@ ity was observed in comparison to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective tolerance or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear @-@ flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

June 2008 Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) officially with that the company takes its application for auth@@ orization of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the cancer of H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people against flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a trunk to the influenza virus , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a bar@@ gain pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ ee appears to spread easily by man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ an of this Stam@@ ms faster antibody .
subsequently , the virus cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the surface of the membrane that recognis@@ es the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , cleaned and used as an integral part of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not executed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines issued for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ics vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information regarding your treatment , please contact your treated doctor .
if you wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to insert , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has taken an anti@@ viral drug of the patient previously , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood evaluated that the virus will address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of rite and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and holds them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure diseases , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby del@@ aying the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , however without ritual viol@@ i , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ia .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase with low do@@ cking ri@@ b@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken during 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
main indi@@ v@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load according to treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than an in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the viral load reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ e ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied in patients , the St John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood .
as in other medicines for HIV , patients who are using A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( devi@@ ations of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that the advantages of as@@ generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat patients treated with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefits of as@@ general in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not taken any prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as at the time of the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to provide a approval for the domestic market of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) and children aged 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ nights ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of k@@ nights ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ glomer@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ nights or other protagon@@ ists were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the application in children under 4 years , due to failure of data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or even liver function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be included , due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r during taking Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase should be used together with low doses of k@@ nights and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk of heavy liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the subject information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis displays an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are used over CY@@ P@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tribut@@ ary function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin are not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of the reduced plasma levels of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene glyco@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied to caution with certain patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , was reported above the onset of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ her@@ edit@@ ary of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy , which are associated with the development of a type of diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ ag@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis , especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of ather@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ cavi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can be hum@@ bled by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St John &apos;s wort , the am@@ b@@ lown up mirror and , if possible to check the viral load and add the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicinal product is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also E@@ states below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to prove the efficacy and uncertainty of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ abo@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) were administered in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended , however , because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
this is why in the gift of E@@ asi@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adap@@ tion is required .
the treatment with emotion in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous ass@@ ort@@ ment of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thereby increasing the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is required together with A@@ gener@@ ase , is advised to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of 700 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole twice a day to a increase of C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ nights .
other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , it is wise to be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can lead to a decrease of the plasma concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ g@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby increases the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma effects and enh@@ ancing P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the k@@ nights of 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily by CY@@ P@@ A4 , the plasma levels of plasma levels are expected to expect at the same time of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plastic pi@@ pelines increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ubar@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug is not recommended using Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
it is recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations of up to stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased during the same period of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ tor@@ so .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium @-@ turn symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is to adapt , if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ a is not predic@@ table , as well as alternative methods for receptions are recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the simultaneous treatment of ag@@ ility ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied according to the possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lact@@ ating rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is over with people into breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given to the u@@ terus at the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed an increase in 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the further development of income , including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r to the matern@@ ity .
the aspects of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the flow @-@ related side effects were slightly up to moderately , coming up early and were seldom used to treat treatment .
many of these events do not clari@@ fy whether they are used in connection with the treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the gr@@ under@@ disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which did not previously treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , and at more than 1 % of the patients were listed as well as treatment operations ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed below .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral fat tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat accumulation ( sti@@ ff@@ les ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .

cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients that were observed twice daily with low dose of cavi@@ ar ( 100 mg twice daily ) , kind and frequency of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose cavi@@ ties , very frequent .
if necessary , the patient is at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary support measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both an acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ ary cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as to periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 re@@ lics in humans are not defined yet .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - such as with other rite cavi@@ ties with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a four rolog@@ ical predi@@ ctions could be examined up to week 48 with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure in the 59 included , showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ cavi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were treated in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical predi@@ ctions about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ interpretation systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , and at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation sample can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always move the latest interpre@@ tations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance based analysis , clin@@ ically vali@@ ant inter@@ interpretation systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically clin@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ off@@ s ( cutting points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of results of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross@@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ lif@@ cavi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients ( one of them reported an resistance to against At@@ az@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / k@@ nights ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / k@@ nights ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isol@@ ates .
early demo@@ lition of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the following treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults with K@@ RT@@ I ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alogy ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ing k@@ b@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three patients ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis marked the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / k@@ nights in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average change of output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub @-@ adhesive threshold of 0.4 log 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of imm@@ ortal A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 , of which 152 will be treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day .
there was no low dose cavi@@ ar at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 Based on these data should be considered in treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ bran@@ ched &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were administered together with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake is influenced by the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood circulation of the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ think@@ able am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ in@@ surg@@ ent am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active stock during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drug P3@@ A4 can be used or absorb the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is from the solution 14 % less flexible than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of kidney function disorder on the elimination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schemes can lead to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r plastic materials comparable to those that are b@@ lown up to a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome at dos@@ ages of exposure to the human beings ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been cleared and relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there were little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance in clinical trials , both of clinical trials and clinical use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome aber@@ ration was included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ b@@ abo@@ r neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical day through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young , which were treated from a 4 @-@ day age , showed a high mortality , both in the controls and with the Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r animals .
in a systemic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which lay significantly under ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed based on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of k@@ nights ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use is to be detected in patients with weak or lighter liver @-@ function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an elevated risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) were administered in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended , however , because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
the treatment with emotion in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ or would be low .
if these medicines are used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is required together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will be able to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ g@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby increases the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
in a clinical study , in the k@@ nights of 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r by 22 % bz@@ w .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after suffering from potential food for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats which was given to the u@@ terus at the end of the stagn@@ ation in u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight when post@@ pon@@ ement .
the aspects of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
if necessary , the patient is at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both an acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ ary cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm for acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered in treatment with PI @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ bran@@ ched &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ in@@ surg@@ ent am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active stock during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drug P3@@ A4 can be used or absorb the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of kidney function disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome at dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of the h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been cleared and relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there were little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance in clinical trials and clinical trials .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome aber@@ ration test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
studies of toxic@@ ity in young , which were treated from a 4 @-@ day age , showed a high mortality , both in the controls and with the Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r animals .
these results make that the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully equipped yet , so that Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) and children aged 4 years .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ up was not occupied with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules with the taking of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ gregate solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dose of cavi@@ ties can be avoided , this combination must be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose @-@ adjustment for Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is not necessary for Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction to the high propylene glyco@@ l content is A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in children and children under 4 years , among pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of 47 of a transfer of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an elevated risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug - 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ ag@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma effects and associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with side effects including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher plasma levels by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk of human beings is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion may not be applied due to potential toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the pro@@ propylene glyco@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lact@@ ating rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is over with people into breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given to the u@@ terus at the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed an increase in 55 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the aspects of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events do not clari@@ fy whether they are used in connection with the treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the gr@@ under@@ disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - such as with other rite cavi@@ ties with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
early demo@@ lition of a failed 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the following treatment .
62 Based on these data should be considered in treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ bran@@ ched &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large extension of Vet@@ rop@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood circulation .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been cleared and relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .

the applic@@ ability and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition of treating Al@@ dar@@ a up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , it is possible to apply for six weeks a week . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ os , it is given for six weeks a week , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream has to be dil@@ uted before bed@@ time on the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) before the skin is washed before it is washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active substance ) compared to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital range for 16 weeks .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete allocation of patients . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and carried out Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either a day or five times a week .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete allocation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ os .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of War@@ ts in the genital area , 15 % to 52 % of patients treated with placebo showed a complete reduction rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long to continue until all the visible flow rate in the genital or Peri@@ od area disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment system should be vo@@ iced if intense local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if the treatment area is observed .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions should only be completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he not@@ ices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in a thin layer and rub into the rolled , with fold @-@ war@@ ts infected skin area , until the cream is completely coated .

in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one of the circumcision &apos;s leading Stri@@ c@@ ture was observed .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which have required a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty having difficulty , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following an treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for the treatment of external feeding in the genital and Peri@@ od zone , there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of ti@@ lt reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elimination of f@@ eig@@ ples , however , a lower efficacy shown .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or hair @-@ based hair was not investigated .
local skin actions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions after finishing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ int@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of patients or due to sever@@ ity of local skin actions , treatment can be made of several days .
clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed following the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , should be dra@@ fted in super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and other suitable treatments .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences are not recommended , hence the application is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a smaller probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ os , inside the nose or ears or in the lip@@ stick @-@ area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os of anatom@@ ic places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application is not recommended , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local Hau@@ tre@@ ads appear frequent , but these reactions usually take effect in the course of therapy or go after the removal of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local Hau@@ tre@@ ads may cause great dis@@ comfort , or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acc@@ - les@@ ions have less complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immune stimul@@ ating characteristics , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

a minimal System@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream due to the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when using in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single @-@ painted bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resignation of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low @-@ induced skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years , and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super fi@@ ci@@ ary cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rati@@ os , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also resulted in the mouse no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year @-@ old study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice of mice spent three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ ually , is a risk of human exposure due to systematic exposure .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice that has been treated with the effective @-@ free cream , previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( as its effect on the reduction of the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver was investigated ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me passed the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , abdominal pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used to treat patients who may not react sensi@@ tively to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or any of the other constitu@@ ents ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) every year will be updated every year , which may be known , check and update this summary .
the producers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who watch al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. granted approval for placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg @-@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ ys@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient can carry this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure is not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies should be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are expected to form lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , it has to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of a sensitivity reaction after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ ent@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or medium @-@ in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ dden and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate on half of the in@@ fusion rate , when the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , serious in@@ fusion response , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decl@@ ining , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction is occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the previous reaction is occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cell admission of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data in new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended to feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions were identified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ i@@ rable drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the incident occurred heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , air@@ still@@ ness and facial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly serious displacement form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version during the age of 5 ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early release from the study ) at 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ardi@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients , where it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of antibodies to low antibodies had a robust reduction in the Har@@ n mirror , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res had a variable reduction in G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low @-@ neutral medical effect on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ oni@@ das@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ i@@ red drugs typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is removed rapidly from the circulation and recorded by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although the patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients were recruited by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a reduced export volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the pro@@ cent@@ ral modification of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study , where she received for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the content that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the projected pro@@ cent@@ ric FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clinical and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ bat@@ ant before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant until the study period .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease between the patients who summar@@ izes the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( expected in the 6 @-@ minute walk ) , generally a improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was performed in an open phase 2 study , which was mainly examined the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study below 5 years ( 16 patients with heavy duty form and 4 with the medium @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dosage increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the intermediate form form a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients , only limited or no progress in cog@@ nitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study investigations were carried out to pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schemes on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , represent a representative alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will have any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to elderly and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ality , the pre @-@ clinical data allow no special dangers for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) in patients who cannot be removed ( drugs against cancer ) when cancer is &quot; non re@@ se@@ z@@ able &quot; ( v@@ icious - cancer alone cannot be removed in other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who had previously not been treated in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and obtained injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or in which certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be applied , decre@@ ed or reduced the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier of@@ stat@@ utory in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a leng@@ thy effect of cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ig@@ ning Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease before .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated with a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( further medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy had received an average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients , in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ epi@@ theli@@ al cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. granted a approval for the office of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every side @-@ side bottle must be delivered with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the side bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin shown in the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except with excessive disk epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for excessive drive epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
reduction and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and the intake must be continued during the total treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to receive a intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third be@@ et@@ ric cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood picture should be produced before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ka@@ ocy@@ tes and a thri@@ ller .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose check will take place under the failure of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the fore@@ seen therapy .
after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood pressure .
if patients are developing non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity at least degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient should use the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients after 2 dose reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 or so@@ - at the onset of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years of age , an increase of interest rates are included in the age of 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adap@@ tations necessary to carry out the dose recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in ab@@ norm@@ ality of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ asis ) are not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in regard to the bone mar@@ ker and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before whose absolute neut@@ rop@@ enia is once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ se number once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ count , thri@@ lls and maximum non @-@ ugly toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity like Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and Inf@@ ection with Grade 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was noticed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients have to be instructed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic measure for reducing toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( C@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ oric acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and mind@@ ing 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid @-@ based fluid collection , a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the ergonom@@ ics are expected to occur in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , these in@@ oc@@ ulation ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible she@@ ep@@ di@@ sposition of reproductive ability is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted , advice regarding the es@@ mak@@ on@@ ser@@ ving .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ thesis ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) resulted in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of a prolifer@@ ation of side effects .
therefore , caution is required if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and mind@@ ing 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the disease status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , demanding and more careful removal of food for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed before the beginning of treatment , advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ e- .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into breast milk and un@@ wanted effects when increasing infants can not be excluded .

it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie @-@ poor , fatty nutrition .
patients who do not take any weight loss after 12 weeks , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t waste some fats in the food , which caused about a quarter of the fat @-@ led fats un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two trials involving patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg according to an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no more relevant weight loss could be observed .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fin@@ atus ( wind ) with chair , gre@@ edy / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering and soft chairs .

the probability of occurr@@ ence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabolic control can take patients who are taking a medicine at diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists , whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
for use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alities ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta car@@ otene in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure an adequate vit@@ amin@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time or@@ list@@ at received , was observed in a lower decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the medication , since the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months and 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the frequently names are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
the frequency of known side effects , which were determined according to the market launch by or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size .
6 . it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ enses with regard to possible resp@@ ecting gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without having significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects , such as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported .
based on research and animal studies , from a rapid recovery of systemic effects , which are attributed to li@@ ft@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at are assumed .

Alo@@ xi is applied to chem@@ o@@ therapies , the powerful trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting are used ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) and chemical therapies ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group no sufficient information .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the domestic market launch by Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and vomiting for nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi prevention prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ et coll@@ age , patients should be supervised with an@@ am@@ nesty or@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able to extend Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval leng@@ th@@ ens or which tend to be an extension .
except in connection with another chemical therapeu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days following chemotherapy for treating nausea and vomiting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron contam@@ inated against tum@@ ors ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless necessary , it is regarded as necessary by the treat doctor .
in clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which may be diagnosed with alo@@ xi in connection with headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ stac@@ king ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar rates of adverse events showed such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out because of the great distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 mc@@ g / m2 of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) that was given to day 1 without the dex@@ am@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are conden@@ sed into the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the culmin@@ ation of the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. in single doses ranging from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After i@@ v &apos;s gift follows a Initi@@ al decrease of Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ ations a slow elimination from the body with an average season half of about 40 hours .
the average maximum temperature of plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the overall dose of dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.0@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average total of 11 doses ranged from day 1 to day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zent@@ ration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations emerg@@ es that at once daily intraven@@ ous application of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached the value of 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max was measured according to the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .

according to a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ject , the overall body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function disorder the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ ory and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relevance for clinical use .
10 of pre @-@ clinical trials revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can extend at the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose was given in approximately 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , ad@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses of dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi according to a unique application , relevance of these results will be minimal .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the approval of regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was suggested to the treatment of al@@ al@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon was similar to a biological medicines called R@@ of@@ er@@ one A with the same medical ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference In@@ ten@@ ders &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long hal@@ ved ) hepatitis C ( a virus infection caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage the liver tissue damage , and also the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was taken to stimul@@ ate this to the formation of active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data presented to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ er@@ one A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , effect of effect , security and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business cycle only of the EMEA is . what were the greatest concerns that the CH@@ MP promp@@ ts the auth@@ orization to be reconc@@ iled to the office ?
in addition , concerns were reported that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the active substance and the market@@ able medication .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ er@@ one A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ant on more patients than with the reference agent ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test was presented in the study to study the question , in@@ correct the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ cis@@ ions of incoming skin infection ) and small infected car@@ er@@ ations ( r@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , r@@ ins@@ ing and con@@ stric@@ ted wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infection that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface is not more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacteria , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was re@@ trac@@ ted after the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected ho@@ ur@@ ers , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in @-@ like response rates : when the results of both studies have been taken together with skin dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ans ( puri@@ fied hollow rooms in body tissue ) or infections , which have been proven to be effective or probably due to MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an appeal .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go at the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections exceeds the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small la@@ z@@ ations , r@@ ushing or paraly@@ zed wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. to provide an approval for the domestic market of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
the patients who showed no improvement within two or three days should still be examined once and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ tis@@ ation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is ab@@ orted carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections , which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials for secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative treatment should be considered to be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in people after top@@ ical use on the poor skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 . after simultaneous use of 2 @-@ times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ ing adjustment will not be held if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity based on oral surgery and are in@@ sufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the red@@ ale / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to the gift of an systemic antibiotic .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is continued , it is between the benefit of nursing inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported cases of irrit@@ ation at the administration location , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vative of P@@ el@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ opilot ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the re@@ mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis , with interaction between the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ izing anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
due to binding on this binding , P@@ el@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line transfer the pep@@ tide transfer , block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ val@@ ency of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms are possible , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton Valentine &apos;s Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was put up daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , single plasma samples were produced .
the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system absorption on people after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 of the poor skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirts .
metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there was neither male nor female rats sign of restricted fer@@ til@@ ity at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure of people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) has been bev@@ elled skin :

ambi@@ rix are used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
am@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix are allowed only to be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the resulting vaccination program can be led to the end of two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vaccines may affect the immune system ( the natural separation of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine has been approved since 1996 and has been approved as Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults is also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the final injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of the ambi@@ rix was similar in a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at injection , redness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not react sensi@@ tively to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ica , a. a approval for the office of the Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , with the first dose on the appointment of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh@@ er chim@@ ney can be used for Hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vaccines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccines .
it is not yet assured whether immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ous persons who have addressed on a hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , as well as protection , as they may also be protected in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies due to immun@@ ological memory .
3 How in all injec@@ tion@@ ants should be used for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dised vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved so in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required .
because intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or bleeding distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception as an exception as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular gift .
when ambient temperature was administered in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ ver therapy or patients with immun@@ al defects , no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vaccine doses by adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ vative vaccine strain .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix which was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ness on a calculation base per vaccination dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the patient following the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine .
according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given am@@ rix were vacc@@ inated with pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % for the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combined vaccine .
however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable ( i.e. over the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ured was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccines , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general reactions were observed in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with the ambi@@ rix , there was a no@@ bility of pain ( at the injection station ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vaccines required to have severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen reported was not different .
in clinical trials which were carried out at vaccination in age between 1 and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study which was conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was imp@@ ass@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with the 3 @-@ dose im@@ pregn@@ ancies in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose .
the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .
the immune response in this study observed immune response to both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed that the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies are comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months of vaccination in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by Baden in the waters contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
in any case of all vaccine , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even when the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccine doses have been infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or sick / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent any condition .
protection against other infections , causing the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if you have a allergic reaction to the Ambi@@ rix or something part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever / fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conven@@ ed administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / her child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective treatment ( 360 ELISA units of a formal in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .

however , it may be that the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the ambient time , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible as possible lim@@ bs .
if ambi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , ambient or lact@@ ating women is not administered unless it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 @-@ im@@ pregn@@ ated doses ) : • sor@@ eness or dis@@ comfort at one point or redness • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite

ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the domestic market , CH@@ MP re@@ signed the opinion that the benefit risk ratio remains positive for ambient ambi@@ rix .
however , in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , Ambi@@ rix are limited to traffic , the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to its low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ astic can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the history of history .
Am@@ mon@@ astic is divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed , mixed under the food or mixed with an Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a no@@ stri@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ g could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ critical medicine , i.e. without an active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ astic is also able to loss loss of loss , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ ten@@ tion , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ comfortable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ g is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle to high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ astic was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as due to the approval of the condition at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was presented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzymes manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) an indication for use when in the history of history , hyper@@ pol@@ em@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer at an early mani@@ um deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing such as a risk for the formation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets will not arrive immediately into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied to patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and eco @-@ level clinical conditions only with caution .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out on the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in a high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delay of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ i@@ rable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ ite patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lact@@ ose acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
case of an over@@ do@@ ation occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with a short one dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a metabolic type , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is separated over the kidneys .
poly@@ phen@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea . both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early in early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the forecast of the early mani@@ fold form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease resulted in treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free an@@ alog@@ a within the first year of life to death .
through hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , protein reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy during pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was diagnosed with many other mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ um form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ pol@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neurological condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with an indication of healthy adults and patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ inst@@ ated metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients from sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets were found 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in bacteria , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) can be detected no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations appear in the plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is left out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated production of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no cl@@ er@@ ous effects in rats ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is used either by oral ( babies and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via an Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a no@@ stri@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , acid and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ ene prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer at an early mani@@ um deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat def@@ ences were exposed before phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ l@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came to les@@ ions in the brain cells of the brain rin@@ gement .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ k@@ ite patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lact@@ ose acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
poly@@ phen@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea . both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neurological condition can occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were found .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the final product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medication above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare illness , certain liver preparations are absent , so they can &apos;t leave the sti@@ ck@@ les @-@ rich waste products , which can accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the nursing time you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the drug may over@@ go into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , flav@@ ours , ob@@ itu@@ des , dis@@ orient@@ ations , memory defic@@ its and deteri@@ oration of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or your hospital with your doctor or your hospital .
if you forgot AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS taking the respective dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS spread between the same single doses or over a gast@@ ric fi@@ ves ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a no@@ stri@@ de ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ules . • Cut a straight edge , e.g. a knife press over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • remove the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar ) , for example with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the breast with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ag@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox is involved in sole gift or associated with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or revisions ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ gone a PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as effective as h@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , where it was much more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it should not be applied in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that angi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and while one PCI is a acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the domestic transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ aning inf@@ ar@@ ction ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) , when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
following clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose is 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a dose of 0.5 mg / kg will be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be reduced .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT levels , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg input dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated with a PCI ( whether using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be ab@@ dic@@ ated and the ACT 5 minutes after finishing the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) which led to the approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be carried out 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ct@@ ant h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of severe h@@ ep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled Hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ zed patients
patients are carefully insp@@ ected with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding occur on arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who are subject to a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment of principle occur everywhere .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be considered to ensure that the value of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ ative R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in returned to the level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge on the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants ) can be assumed that these active ingredients may increase the risk of blood .
in each case , the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in each case regularly .
the experimental tests have inadequate effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fra@@ ct@@ ant h@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with h@@ ep@@ arin was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than with male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less frequently than in groups with h@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY is defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cor@@ ial , retro@@ sp@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood flow or bleeding within the point of punc@@ ture , reducing the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a blood pressure , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alis@@ ations that occurred in more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ ats , ears , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients receiving one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with h@@ ep@@ arin was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than with male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Hep@@ ar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system classes in Table 6 .
in case of an overdose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately breaking and the patient close to signs of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ oc@@ or , which bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ rical region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or straight line .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ anders the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby creating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with serum from patients , where it was used in the past to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced to in@@ duce Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregate reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in showed a dos@@ ing and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one card was performed in the patient below one PCI , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected or as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin control of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or can handle insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ ture differs in a slightly lower of human insulin , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter mode of action has been a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where the body does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the substance of gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin injec@@ tions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can influence on blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to provide an approval for the office of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or dol@@ phins or sub@@ cut@@ aneously by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin metabolism , the insulin demand for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced .
any change in action , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may move a change of insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin requiring diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient on an other insulin type or an insulin model should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the profile of the insulin profile and can therefore change the schem@@ as of the treatment scheme .
to the substances which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , angi@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ot@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ ren@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , S@@ ali@@ y@@ lic and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ ckers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pine may be weak@@ ened or missing symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen .
animal experiments showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin scar@@ ves in human breast milk , but in general , insulin occurs neither in breast milk , nor it is res@@ or@@ able after oral application .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fails to continuously change the injection plant within the injection system , can occur in the result of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y on the injection station .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of consciousness may be given by a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person , or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose through a doctor .
after a glucose projection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the urine cause of severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be occurs qu@@ icker in the response time and the effect of action is shorter than in hu@@ gely enough normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional b@@ lower glucose effect , and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ ism has a double @-@ fast response rate as normal human insulin and achieves the full drau@@ ght effect around 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data was clearly shown that at an application of insulin ing@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin which will be given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin ing@@ es@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was caught , a better post @-@ den@@ den@@ al control was given as with human normal insulin which was given for 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is an@@ gled in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as in human normal insulin which is 2 Mi@@ xed before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ ms , the 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) was given before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
