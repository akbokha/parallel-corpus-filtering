<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Library Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to discuss recommendations on the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need additional information on your disease or treatment, please read the packages (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and talking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and insets; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness, alternating the patient manic episodes (periods of abnormal levels) alternating normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is prescribed for treatment medium to severe manganese episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-solution is applied to rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders, if the oral medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">These diseases can be used to take the solution or the melting tablets in patients, which the swallowing of tablets has been used.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transfer between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripizole probably works as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripibenzene means such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter is to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can play a role, Aripibenzene contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-emerge.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, reemergence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection-solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia, schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and Placebo, which have been resurrected to 160 patients, where the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injectionsolution was diagnosed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, who suffered from gested restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients underwent a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body reacts the melting tablets and the solution to take effect.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduce the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurring of Manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased slightly more effective than placebo and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), infathic acid (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision (increased memory), drowsincation (increased memory production), fatigue, exhaustion (increased aliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe episodes of patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and with whom the lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripibenzene, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection-solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate to sustain the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the authorization of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode shown in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripibenzene (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages of 15 mg dosage was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to greater sensitivity of this patient-group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justifying this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripibenzene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belongs to mental disorders and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripibenzene (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have increased suicidal risk with Aripibenzene compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripibenzene should be applied to treat patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are prescribed for hypotonia (dehydration) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskineration: in clinical trials, which one year or less digestible, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripibenzene.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dynasty occur, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripibenzene should be used in patients with seizures in the history of history or at states that are related to caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripibenzene in patients associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripibenzene to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixer's dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and appeal for undesirable events with Aripibenzene.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacial or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic fluid materials, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic fluid-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripibenzene to the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripibenzene is used in combination with alcohol or other central-effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripibenzene, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripibenzene by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma levels of Aripibenzene compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, should potential benefit the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, might have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diactiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are given together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripibenzene showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethacrylate / 3-methodology xymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripibenzene.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data base to humans and due to the concerns of animal studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential is justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, the patients also should be warned against other anti-psychotics to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripizole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripibenzene, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the adverse events that can occur in connection with a anti-psychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinmates and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch an unintentional or estimated superdose of Aripibenzene were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hemoralysis treatment with Aripibenzene; however, it is unlikely that hemoralysis is in the treatment of a sudozation of benefits, as Aripibenzene has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripibenzene in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a presses.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripibenzene revealed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptors as well as a fresh affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenches and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the gift of Aripibenzene in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg, the Positcartridges-Emissions-Tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, an D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripibenzene demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one of the Haloperidol study, 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities, which included a response to the study medication, were similar to the study medication in both groups (Aripibenzene 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement that were defined as secondary studio species, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripibenzene revealed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripibenzene group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks with patients with a manor or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripibenzene showed a placebo superior to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixer's patients with a manor or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripibenzene showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manor or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripibenzene showed a placebo superior to placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to a week of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripibenzene also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manor or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental features that partially spread over 2 weeks, the companion of Aripibenzene revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10. in a placebo controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks, Aripibenzene had been superior to placebo during a stabilising period prior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar shift, predominantly in the prevention of a retreat.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydrifts and Hydroxyzole, the N-Dealkyrie is catdialyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationshalbtship is approximately 75 hours for Aripibenzene in Extensive Metabolists on CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as an pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific analysis for pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripibenzene.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic features of Aripibenzene and Dehydro-Aripibenzene were similar in patients with severe kidney failure, compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli active ingredient that promotes the storage of microtubules from the Tubular indigenes and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting of their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibit of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital intervention and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumocytosis of plasma components are mediated in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of Albumaxel promotes through the endothelial cells.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural development of peripheral neuropathy to sound base on Baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient composition (AUC) rose linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous gift of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, paclitaxel plasma concentration took off to multi-phase ways.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extended extravascular distribution and / or soft connection by paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors, pharmacokinetic properties were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent half-quality paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-gift (43%) than after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily based on 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and for two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypad and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative action was 4% of the total dose of less than 1% of the metabolism 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaxel, which points to a vast non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed a biological drug is similar, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference holders").</seg>
<seg id="360">Patients with normal blood ferrous use is used in which in connection with a blood transfusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible, and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with illness, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to take a self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his coelitist, if they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobbinations should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decor in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or patients with kidney problems can be caused by anemia by an erythropoietinmangel, or by which the body is not sufficient for the body of his own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells, thus reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of epoxettin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection in a vein in the context of a major study with 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused anaemia, compared with the reference agent.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks at least eight weeks before they were injected either on seamed or continued to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the project period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were injected with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abortions, were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continue Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise of blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, side-crative headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against epoxettin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the drug was provided for seamed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which makes Abseamed, will provide information on medical specialist personnel in all Member States, including information on the security of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins around more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) should be avoided for a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed on or under hemoglobin targets.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increased by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxetine alfa dose is 25% reduce.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Library Report (EPAR), in which explained how the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to discuss recommendations on the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • Es (monotherapy) can be used in patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) cannot be used. • It can be applied together with another diabetmedicine medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphur resin, or insulin, the previous dose of Sulfonylharnae and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphur resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar levels decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy were examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphuylliant, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphurea production in a decrease in the HbA1c values increased by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin were examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving the Actos in addition to insulin, compared with the HbA1c values of 0.69% to 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acetone may not be used either in patients who may react sensitively to pioglitazon or one of the other ingredients, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketones - acid in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to provide an approval for the office of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate for contraindications or intolerability (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose infinitely variable.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema, if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced makrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about heart failure, however, was not led to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels increase up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyvalues are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that hints on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, degradation, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark Harn, are the liver enzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazon should be continued until the incident of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, dosisdependent weight gain has been detected, which can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases linked with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemorelution in therapy with pioglitazon, a lower reduction in the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobins around 3-4% and hematology (relative reduction in hemoglobins um 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity, the Pioglitazon consists of oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulphur resin, or as a double combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with Thiazolidindian, including pioglitazon, above a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a deterioration of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but defile doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema; a suitable ophthalmological abnormalities should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events regarding bone brokers from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 questionnaires in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (2.5%; 1.0 cargo) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 female patient) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient is willing to wish for a pregnancy or enter it, treatment is abated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon have no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenymon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines referred to by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-Reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC by Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is estimated that under treatment with pioglitazon that reduces hyperinsulin inemia and increased insulin resistance in the mother's pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and the width of the lens, as they also be observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, ALT-gradients occurred on three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as compared to placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced makrovascular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch was rarely reported on heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of messages undesixed randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (5.1%) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator or Receptor-γ (PPAR)) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has continued to be over two years to investigate the time until aftermath of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients (over 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study on 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate, despite the three-imonary optimisation phase, were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the middle HbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to the patients who still only received insulin; a reduction in the insulin injecting in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, under pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotives showed a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotives.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks postural analysis of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and slightly, however clinically significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, under Pioglitazon no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed, while under metformin and gliclazid decreased values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride level, this also improved over a effect on the triglyceride absorption, and also on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced makrovascular disease were randomized to either existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon becomes fast resorable, with the peak concentrations in unaltered pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazon, while the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon had no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenymon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma centration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazon in humans the markers were found mainly in the foxes (55%) and found a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-Elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolism is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function, lower than in healthy volunteers, but resembles the rates of oral Clearance of Mother's substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated administration Plasmains-Enforcement with hematlution, anemia, and reversible excentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is estimated that under treatment with pioglitazon that reduces hyperinsulin inemia and increased insulin resistance to the parent's body and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) were induced by the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family adenomatous polyposs (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindian increased to an increased frequency of colontologists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 questionnaires in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (2.5%; 1.0 cargo) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 female patient) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with pioglitazone or gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-quotives compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postdendial triglyceride level, which has increased over a effect on the tryglerid absorption, and also on the hepatic tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in terms of their primary endpoint, a combination of the whole mortal syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckles, Coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, lay the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not associated with cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages undesixed randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon, showed an increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was investigated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks, the concentration of a substance (glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured as well as blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar, as strongly as with another human insulin.</seg>

<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to conclude that the advantages of acetane in the treatment of diabetes would be overweight.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S to provide an approval for the supply of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a fast-initiated effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients who have significantly improved blood sugar levels, for example, can significantly affect the hypoglycemia-warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast-effective, biologic, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin or insulin analogue) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNS on insulin of animal origin) can cause that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switch to Actraphane is required if the patient is necessary, it can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, in which hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of animal insulin had occurred, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia had less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">In particular, the patient should go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician, as such trips can carry out that insulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy, and his patients are still inferred to others of them.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplantations, should prearrange this medicine or take changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the respective daily dosage; Modification of formulation or regime should only be made under the engmaschigen control of one in transplantation medical devices (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of depreciation and tolerability in the individual case and on blood-level regulations (see below)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talmud should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was measured as the level of tales, both with both sides of kidney stones and in transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-talons are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate aftertransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas may take several days until the Steady State is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustment can be necessary later, as pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilising the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the transplant detection of the oral Advaginal therapy should start with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosisrecommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a daily intake of Prograf capsules at a once daily intake of Advagraf. thus, this changeover in relation is 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after a changeover from other Immunosuppressants on Advagraf once daily must start treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for prophylaxis for prophylaxis.</seg>

<seg id="1427">Other graft receiver, although there is no clinical experience with additives in pneumonia, pankreas- and darmtransplanted patients, in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, at pankreastral transplant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for application.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bloodlines in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function can no influence on pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular basis of the serum concentration, a calculation of the creatinin and monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry frequent controls in the Tacrolimus valley during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirror of Tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion from programming to Advagraf, dose adaption, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus blood-blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Because Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials insisted that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the blood level cannot exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tackles levels of Tacrolimus usually lie in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with renal and hearted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplant and other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the respective daily dosage; Modification of formulation or regime should only be made under the engmaschigen control of one in transplantation medical devices (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is provided as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in these circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, as Kardiomyopathy, chamber or hypertrophie was observed, which can therefore be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid exposure, and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to suitable clothing or using a solar control factor.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available, the CHMP has continued to assess the value risk provisions as a positive result, but in consideration that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply further extension procedures for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) officially with that the company is continuing its application for the marketing authorization of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, bone or soft parts (tissues, which links other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a sort of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that there is no copies of themselves, so that no infections can trigger in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"" "" "" "Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to reform the normal p53 protein." ""</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body of the existing p53 gene, normally wears to restore DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, if the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can further grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of substrate, in bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP requests the answers to the questions presented to him, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of initially submitted documents, CHMP sent to day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors bring advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin may be manufactured in a reliable way, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in direct contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1654">"Changed Reaction 'means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeropaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal smuginal surgery (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective dimensions were the changes of the hypocro symptoms that were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary covering a standard skala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all hypocrite symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported that Aerinaze's income reported about a decrease of symptoms by 46,0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients under aeropaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are speedometer, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (severe pain), anopulation, headache, fatigue, insomolence (sleepiness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropaze may be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenerous substances or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeropaze also should not be used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (high eye pressure), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyself (hyperthyroid disease) or already have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by cerebral bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic strokes.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to provide an approval for the transport of Aeropaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is the whole to swallow (i.e. without them to break, break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to misfortune and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after removing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrine in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the mucous membranes in the upper breath, treatment with desloratadin may continue as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity for combined use of Pseudoephedrine, with other vasoconstriants such as Bromocripitin, pergoid, lihydroergotamine or other decongestiva, which are applied to peroral or nasal as secretion of Rhinology, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxygenazolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data is not sufficient to send recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and the effectiveness of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to send appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients have to be informed that the treatment at the onset of hypertension or tachykarst or of palm-pitations, heart rhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a gain of headaches) must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups: • Patients under digital is patient (patients with hypertension) patient with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of history, diabetes mellitus, bladder semi-instruction or bronchospasmus in the history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines could reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally used, however, no clinical relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences between the desloratadin and the placebo were detected, regardless of whether desloratadin alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme has not been identified so that interactions with other drugs can't be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not hemmed and neither a substrate of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The incomprehension of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, yet with a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and based on vasoconstriving properties of Pseudoephedrin should not be used in pregnancy in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases to a drowsiness, which can lead to a impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightened, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tensions, euphoria, excitation, breathing heart failure, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, concealed pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxie, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as Atrophin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, peupillenrigid and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhessionate P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes, including amplification subjective tolerance or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of slumity was observed in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycaring or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine agonistical efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was determined based on the total score for the symptom (except nasal muck), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in regard to the weakening effect, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy associated with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the equivalent of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of an pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were desloratadin badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component analysis study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine following the sole gift of Pseudoephedrine in bioequivalent was to exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies for security analytics, toxicity in repetitive gift, for genotoxicity and reproductionality, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin do not realize special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the active ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">The combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine used in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day non teratov.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (among them four trials in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of quaddling, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after a six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to demonstrate that the body forms the syrup, the solution to take-up and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius to an average decrease of the symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 26%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% for patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials in Urticaria, the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo treated patients compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who possibly have to be sensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe offering a approval for the office of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see under section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should end up according to the previous disease and may end after the symptoms and can be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the Persian-allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergies time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in the context of clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally used (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study at the same time intake of Aerius and alcohol is not intensified by the effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, considered in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that reported more frequently than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of the patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, given up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhessionate P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multi-outlets, in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis was Aerius effective in preventing symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, tear-flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persizing allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As the result of the total value of life for life of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius diminished the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigating the underlying pathophysiology as the underlying pathophysiology regardless of the etiology are similar to different forms and chronic patients can be easily controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release a causal factor in all urticular diseases, Desloratadin is expected, besides the chronically idiopathic urticaria in other forms of primitive symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of puritus and the reduction of size and number of addling at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronically idiopathic Urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamine, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin who were treated with placebo-treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilant, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, which were comparable to patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence points for a clinical relevant cumulation after a daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadin who was not identified yet so that interactions with other drugs are not excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not hemmed and neither a substrate of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fat, low-rich breakfast) is not included on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out by Desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparably degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity fils of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies for safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeatable gift, genotoxicity and reproductionality, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin do not realize special dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken regardless of meals in relation to symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see under section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The taxed doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see under section 4.4) and that no data suggest that a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius support.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic desloratadin reduced and experienced a higher substatic load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which metabolic metabolic is identical, is identical with children, the normal metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose gactose-absorptionshemsis or a saccharase isomaltas- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in the context of clinical trials with Aerius tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally used (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study at the same time intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol is not intensified by the effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) officially with that the company takes its application for authorization of Aflunov to prevent the cancer of H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people against flu, caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which could cause a trunk to the influenza virus, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A bargain pandemic breaks out if a new tribe of the Grippevee appears to spread easily by man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form a Grippevan of this Stamms faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the virus cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the surface of the membrane that recognises the human body as a body-foreign), cleaned and used as an integral part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not executed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines issued for prepandemics vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information regarding your treatment, please contact your treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are caused by human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1) which is caused by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to insert, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should then be prescribed if the doctor has checked, which has taken an antiviral drug of the patient previously, and the likelihood evaluated that the virus will address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of rite and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and holds them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure diseases, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby delaying the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, however without ritual violi, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with proteasehemia.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase with low docking ribavir reinforced drug Agenerase has been taken during 206 adults who had previously taken proteasinhibitors with other proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indivator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load according to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously taken no proteasinhibitors, had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than an indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase reduced the virusload, but with the children who had previously been treated with proteasehemiah, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Proteasinhibitors, the viral load reinforced the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitor, there came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous proteasinhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoe (diarrhea), flatulence (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Ambavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should not be applied in patients, the St John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are the same as Agenerase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As in other medicines for HIV, patients who are using Agenerase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoneksis (deviations of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to conclude that the advantages of asgeneric medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat patients treated with HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee determined that the benefits of asgeneral in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have not taken any proteasinhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, as at the time of the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to provide a approval for the domestic market of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase should be administered to pharmacokinetic booths of Ambavir along with low doses of knights (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambabor should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambabor as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Ambavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram basis is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Ambavir twice daily with 100 mg of konavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ageneric capsules are used without the amplifying addition of knights (boosting), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg ambabor that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agglomerase in combination with low doses of knights or other protagonists were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for the application in children under 4 years, due to failure of data for unquestionable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Ageneric capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with serious liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or even liver function disorder with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also provide substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be included, due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ambabor during taking Ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with atherase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase should be used together with low doses of knights and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, increased risk of heavy liver side effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the subject information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis displays an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase or other Glukokorticoids, which are used over CYPA4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight, including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the tributary function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor is highly dependent on CYPA4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin are not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International normative Ratio), methods are available to determine the active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of the reduced plasma levels of Ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive can be changed, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiracy symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of a toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied to caution with certain patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to duration 5, if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors, was reported above the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exazhereditary of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy, which are associated with the development of a type of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug addictive factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hagophile patients (type A and B) which were treated with proteasinhibitors are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoms and hematthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of an antiretroviral therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneksis, especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of atherase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also provide substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly related to CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC by Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritoncavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambabor can be humbled by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St John's wort, the amblown up mirror and, if possible to check the viral load and add the St John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicinal product is not required if Nelfinavir is administered along with Ambabor (see also Estates below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cmax by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambabor were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily used to prove the efficacy and uncertainty of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Ambaboavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kaviavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambabor in plasma, which were obtained at the combination of Ambabor (600 mg twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambabor (600 mg twice daily) were administered in combination with 100 mg of konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra can not be given, but it is not recommended, however, because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin combination with Didanosin combination, however, due to the antacid component of didanosin, the proceeds from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">This is why in the gift of Easiirenz in combination with Ambabor (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaption is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with emotion in combination with Ambabor and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protein inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteasinhibitor and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced and potentially subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be made, as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Ambavir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous assortment of Ambabor and Rifabutin led to a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thereby increasing the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required together with Agenerase, is advised to reduce the dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however, the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of 700 mg Ketoconazole twice a day to a increase of Cmax of Ketoconazole in plasma compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazole a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with knights.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below are also substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are used together with Agenerase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs when they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasinhibitor, it is wise to be taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it can occur to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with ambabor can lead to a decrease of the plasma concentration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, dipin, Nicardipin, nigdipin, nimodipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipin and verapamil can be increased 10 by Ambabor, thereby increases the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with Agenerase can increase their plasma effects and enhancing PDE5 inhibitors associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the knights of 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate plasma levels (4 times daily), the fluorozone propionate plasma levels increased by about 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous treatment of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these Glukokorticoids, unless the potential benefit of a treatment is overweight (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends heavily by CYPA4, the plasma levels of plasma levels are expected to expect at the same time of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plastic pipelines increases this HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhubaryolysis, the combined use of this drug is not recommended using Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations of up to stabilising the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased during the same period of Ambabor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase should not be applied together with oral mdazolam (see section 4.3), while in simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4-torso.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on opium-turn symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as the Ambavir- dose is to adapt, if Ambabor is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International normative Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contracepa is not predictable, as well as alternative methods for receptions are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramin and nortryptilin) is recommended for the simultaneous treatment of agility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied according to the possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, Ambabor-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambabor is over with people into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was given to the uterus at the end of the lactation of Ambabor, showed an increase in 12 body weight during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of income, including fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of Ambabor to the maternity.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The aspects of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the flow-related side effects were slightly up to moderately, coming up early and were seldom used to treat treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events do not clarify whether they are used in connection with the treatment of Agenerase or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the grunderdisease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), which did not previously treated patients 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), assessed by the investigators as in connection with the study medication, and at more than 1% of the patients were listed as well as treatment operations (degree 3 to 4) are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral fat tissue, increased intraabdominals and visceral fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat accumulation (stiffles).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons who had been treated with Ambabor in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study at 245 NRTI- treated patients under Ambabor 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs about a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Normally, skin rash were usually slightly until moderately pronounced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with Ambbabor had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoneksis cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients that were observed twice daily with low dose of caviar (100 mg twice daily), kind and frequency of side effects (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were similar to patients who received Agenerase together with low dose cavities, very frequent.</seg>
<seg id="2015">If necessary, the patient is at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) when necessary, necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambabor binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the procedures of viral gag- and Gag-pol- polarity with the result of a formation unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both an acute and chronic lymphoary cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as to peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor (IC50) of Ambabor is in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µm in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambabor against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 relics in humans are not defined yet.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - such as with other rite cavities with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosagavir with 100mg of konavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a four rological predictions could be examined up to week 48 with 14 isolates genotypic.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure in the 59 included, showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, M3R, M3V, M3V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58V, A71V, V77I, V82a / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosoncavir twice daily: n = 107) with proteasinhibitors were treated in patients with virological predictions about 96 weeks, the following proteasinhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance-based analyses of genotypic interinterpretation systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, and at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation sample can be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always move the latest interpretations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In conjunction with the genotypic resistance based analysis, clinically valiant interinterpretation systems can be applied in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically clinotypical cut-offs (cutting points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to interpretation of results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambabor associated genetic pattern creates a certain crossresistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Ambavir and other proteasinhibitors for all 4 Fosamplifcavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients (one of them reported an resistance to against Atazanavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), inavir / knights (three of 24 isolates), inavir / knights (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">In reverse, Ambabor retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a versing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits, which can affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, in which with PI pre-treated adults with KRTI (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanalogy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosing kbavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three patients (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis marked the non-superiority of APV / knights in relation to the time-adjusted average change of output value (AAUCMB) in plasma load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, at a non-sub-adhesive threshold of 0.4 log 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of immortal Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV-infected children aged between 2 and 18, of which 152 will be treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was used twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose caviar at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered in treatment optimisation with PI-treated children of "unbranched" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambabor is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were administered together with Ambabor (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambabor 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake is influenced by the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Ambabor from the blood circulation of the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unthinkable ambabor, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of non-insurgent ambabor remains constant, the percentage of the free active stock during the dosing intervals in the Steady State across the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drug P3A4 can be used or absorb the CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Ambabor exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambabor is from the solution 14% less flexible than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable for a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, hence the effect of kidney function disorder on the elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes can lead to ambabor plastic materials comparable to those that are blown up to a dose of 1200 mg of Ambavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of the carcinogenicity with Ambabor in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne hepatocellular Adenome at dosages of exposure to the human beings (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular Adenome and Karzinome has not been cleared and relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance in clinical trials, both of clinical trials and clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial lymphoma test, microcore test in rats and chromosome aberration was included in human peripheral lymphocytes was ambabor neither mutually nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical day through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed, neither during the administration of Agenerase, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies of toxicity in young, which were treated from a 4-day age, showed a high mortality, both in the controls and with the Ambabor animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasmaexposition, which lay significantly under (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats), however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor skeletal changes were observed based on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Ageneric capsules are used without the amplifying addition of knights (boosting), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg ambabor that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (as its effect on the reduction of the Gag-concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme passed the Gag-concentrations in urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthralgia (joint pain), abdominal pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used to treat patients who may not react sensitively to Laronidase or any of the other constituents (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) every year will be updated every year, which may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who watch aldurazyme in terms of reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. granted approval for placing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, egg-stock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme treatment in patients with safe diagnosis of a Muysysaccharitin I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological symptoms of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient can carry this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure is not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any related side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies should be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies are expected to form laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, it has to be cautious due to the theoretical risk of a sensitivity reaction after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipyentka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or medium-infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be wodden and / or reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate, when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, serious infusion response, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are declining, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction is occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, where the previous reaction is occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracell admission of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data in newborns, which were exposed to laronidase over breast milk, is recommended to feed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions were identified mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the incident occurred heavy reactions, including bronchospasmus, airstillness and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly serious displacement form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, whereby it came to a seroconversion during the age of 5 (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to an early release from the study) at 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radioimmunopardicipation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, where it never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of antibodies to low antibodies had a robust reduction in the Harn mirror, while patients with high antibody titres had a variable reduction in Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low-neutral medical effect on the enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions, even if the occurrence of undesired drugs typically fell together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrats and the preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is removed rapidly from the circulation and recorded by cells into the lysosomes, the most likely about Mannose-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although the patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were recruited by the mean phenotype and only one patient proved the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a reduced export volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the procentral modification of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where she received for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the content that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the projected procentric FEV is clinically significant over this period of clinical and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepbatant before treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the Gag-mirror in the Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant until the study period.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease between the patients who summarizes the clinically significant changes for five efficacy variable (expected in the 6-minute walk), generally a improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was performed in an open phase 2 study, which was mainly examined the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study below 5 years (16 patients with heavy duty form and 4 with the medium-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage increased due to increased GAG- Spiegel in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the intermediate form form a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients, only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study investigations were carried out to pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes on the Gag-Spiegel in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly infusions, represent a representative alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2378">In patients who received Pemetremixed, a complete blood picture should be produced before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukaocytes and a thriller.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose check will take place under the failure of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the foreseen therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, the patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which apply for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients are developing non-hematological toxicity at least degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient should use the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken when in patients after 2 dose reduction, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 or so- at the onset of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, compared to patients aged 65 years of age, an increase of interest rates are included in the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for unquestionable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adaptations necessary to carry out the dose recommended for all patients recommended Dosisizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in abnormality of liver metastasis) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastasis) are not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophilencount, thrills and maximum non-ugly toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthatological toxicity like Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and Infection with Grade 3 / 4 Neutropenie was noticed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients have to be instructed with Pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for reducing toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (CSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyloric acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) must be avoided for at least 2 days before therapy, on day of therapy and minding 2 days after therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2396">Many patients, where these events occurred, had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid-based fluid collection, a drainage of the effusion of the ergonomics are expected to occur in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasionally, if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, these inoculation) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is required if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on day of therapy and minding 2 days after therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potentials with NSAIDs, such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use must be avoided with Pemetremixed for at least 5 days before therapy, on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the disease status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulant and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International normative Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites are expected during an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied to chemotherapies, the powerful triggers for nausea and vomiting are used (like Cisplatin) and chemical therapies (such as Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by an additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group no sufficient information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared with 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">With a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the domestic market launch by Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and vomiting for nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi prevention prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by severe emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thicket collage, patients should be supervised with anamnesty orstipation or signs of subacute Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable to extend Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval lengthens or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemical therapeutics, Aloxi should neither be used in the days following chemotherapy for treating nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron contaminated against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Doxorubicin, Chinidine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless necessary, it is regarded as necessary by the treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (a total of 633 patients), which may be diagnosed with aloxi in connection with headache (9%) and Obstacking (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions to the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar rates of adverse events showed such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-action relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out because of the great distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective treatment for aloxi- overdozation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide, and 250 micrograms or 750 mcg / m2 of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-time 7.3 hours) that was given to day 1 without the dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients, which received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 mcg Palonosetron, received 32 mg of Ondansetron which were given to Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetoed chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are condensed into the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the culmination of the ventricular de- and repolarization of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. in single doses ranging from 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After iv's gift follows a Initial decrease of Plasmaconzentations a slow elimination from the body with an average season half of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum temperature of plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the overall dose of dose of 0.3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.025 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average total of 11 doses ranged from day 1 to day 5 (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations emerges that at once daily intravenous application of 0,25 mg Palonosetron reached the value of 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax was measured according to the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron found approximately 80% of the dose found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron designed as an unaltered substance, about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous Bolusinject, the overall body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disorder the terminale Eliminationshalbory and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) passed a negative report in which the approval of regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was suggested to the treatment of alaleon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was similar to a biological medicines called Roferone A with the same medical ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Intenders").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long halved) hepatitis C (a virus infection caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage the liver tissue damage, and also the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was taken to stimulate this to the formation of active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data presented to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferone A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, effect of effect, security and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were reported that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the active substance and the marketable medication.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferone A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retardant on more patients than with the reference agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test was presented in the study to study the question, incorrect the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used for the treatment of impetigo (one with crucisions of incoming skin infection) and small infected carerations (riss- or chives), rinsing and constricted wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infection that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but for patients under the age of 18, the skin surface is not more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacteria, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was retracted after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected hourers, Altargo and Cefalexin-like response rates: when the results of both studies have been taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, found that Altargo was not effective in the treatment of abscans (purified hollow rooms in body tissue) or infections, which have been proven to be effective or probably due to MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of altargo at the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections exceeds the risks: • Impetigo, infected small lazations, rushing or paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. to provide an approval for the domestic market of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients who showed no improvement within two or three days should still be examined once and an alternative therapy is considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitisation or heavy local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is aborted carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections, which MRSA is known as pathogens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials for secondary infected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment should be considered to be considered if after a 2-3 day treatment is no improvement or deterioration of the infected.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which were achieved in people after topical use on the poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical use in patients, dosing adjustment will not be held if topical retapamulin was used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity based on oral surgery and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the redale / post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin to the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated, or the therapy with Altargo is continued, it is between the benefit of nursing infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied to Altargo, the most frequently reported cases of irritation at the administration location, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pelromutilin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilot (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The remechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis, with interaction between the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interagizing antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding of the ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-ties and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding on this binding, Pelromutiline transfer the peptide transfer, block some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalency of resistance the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms are possible, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine's Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin salbe was put up daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% retapamulin salbe received twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary wounds, single plasma samples were produced.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system absorption on people after topical use of 1% obe to 200 cm2 of the poor skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP shirts.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2724">Amrix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix are allowed only to be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the resulting vaccination program can be led to the end of two doses.</seg>

<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines may affect the immune system (the natural separation of the body)," "" "how it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and the surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine has been approved since 1996 and has been approved as Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix Adults is also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the final injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of the ambirix was similar in a sixth and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at injection, redness, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitively to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2739">The Standardization plan for the Grunrix consists of two vaccine doses, with the first dose on the appointment of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher chimney can be used for Hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalant vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalents vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardised vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved so in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In Thrombocytopenie or bleeding disturbances, Ambirix can be injected as an exception as an exception as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambient temperature was administered in the second year of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular pertus-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and matured was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- and 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions were observed in the Ambirixgruppe with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with the ambirix, there was a nobility of pain (at the injection station) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines required to have severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccine with ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen reported was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were carried out at vaccination in age between 1 and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 aborted dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since issuance of the first approval for the domestic market, CHMP resigned the opinion that the benefit risk ratio remains positive for ambient ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), Ambirix are limited to traffic, the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to its low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonastic can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defective or with hyperammonia (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonastic is divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or mixed with an Gastrostomieschlalso (through the abdominal wall in the stomach's leading hose) or a nostride (through the nose in the stomach's leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammong could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a hypocritical medicine, i.e. without an active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonastic is also able to loss loss of loss, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Ammong is effective in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle to high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonastic was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances," "" "as due to the approval of the condition at the time of approval, only limited information on this drug was presented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme has already manifested in the newborn (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifold form (incomplete enzymes manifested after the first life of life) an indication for use when in the history of history, hyperpolemic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer at an early manium deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing such as a risk for the formation of Ösophagusulcera if the tablets will not arrive immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which is equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied to patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and eco-level clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out on the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylacetate to young rats in a high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) a slowdown of neurons and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delay of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is eliminated in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorekite patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactose acid, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">Case of an overdoation occurred in a 5-month-old small child with a short one dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed a dosislimiting neurotoxicity with a intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic type, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is separated over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Polyphenometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea. both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early in early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the early manifold form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infant, and the disease resulted in treating peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking free analoga within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemoralysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen cretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic), protein reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first life of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy during pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was diagnosed with many other mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manium form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of the Ornithintranny bamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperpolylbutyrat and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat with an indication of healthy adults and patients with liver cirrhosis, hemoglobinstated metabolism and with liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites were also studied in cancer patients from sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets were found 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disorders or hemoglobin bacteria, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) can be detected no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle Phenylacetate concentrations appear in the plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is left out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated production of phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clerous effects in rats (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is used either by oral (babies and children who can't swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing) or via an Gastrostomy or a nostride.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, acid and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serene proteine in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer at an early manium deficiency of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat defences were exposed before phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the brain cells of the brain ringement.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorekite patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactose acid, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>

<seg id="2858">Based on research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were found.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the final product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medication above a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare illness, certain liver preparations are absent, so they can't leave the stickles-rich waste products, which can accumulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes "(ACS, decreased blood sugar), for example with unstable Angina (a form of pain in the breast with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without" St- Hebung "(an abnormal measurement value of the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiagox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox is involved in sole gift or associated with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa-Inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter) and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revisions) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergone a PCI was angiox in terms of all indicators as effective as heparin, except for heavy bleeding, where it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other Hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should not be applied in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) came to conclude that angiox is at the treatment of ACS and while one PCI is a acceptable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd. a approval for the domestic transport of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable Angina / non-ST-leaning infarction) (IA / NSTEMI)), when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is carried out in another row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">Following clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose is 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a dose of 0.5 mg / kg will be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly following intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the Bolusdose rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg input dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are treated with a PCI (whether using Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be abdicated and the ACT 5 minutes after finishing the second bolt dose.</seg>

<seg id="2907">Even if in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, most bleeding occur on arterial points can occur in patients who are subject to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment of principle occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin should be considered to ensure that the value of the INR-Werts (International normative Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bivalirudin returned to the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge on the action mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocytenants) can be assumed that these active ingredients may increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY is defined as one of the following events: intracorial, retrospitoneal, intraocular blood flow or bleeding within the point of puncture, reducing the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood pressure, reoperation due to a blood pressure, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localisations that occurred in more than 0,1% (occasionally) were "other" point of points, retroperitoneal, gastroats, ears, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients receiving one PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately breaking and the patient close to signs of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinocor, which binds both on the catalytic center as well as at the Anionenbindrical region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or straight line.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect is reversible, because Thrombin sanders the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby creating the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with serum from patients, where it was used in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was induced to induce Thrombocyte aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin showed a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatorial effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one card was performed in the patient below one PCI, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg of Bivalirudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study was administered by unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected thighs or upper arm injected or as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin control of glucose (sugar) in the blood or can handle insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulture differs in a slightly lower of human insulin, and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter mode of action has been a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body can not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where the body does not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of the substance of glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed compared to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin injections.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can influence on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to provide an approval for the office of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall, thigh or dolphins or subcutaneously by continuous infusion in the field of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin metabolism, the insulin demand for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in action, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may move a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or demolition of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin requiring diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient on an other insulin type or an insulin model should take place under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the profile of the insulin profile and can therefore change the schemas of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, angiopyramid, fibrotine-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifrenin, Propoxylic, Saliylic and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympatholytics such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpine may be weakened or missing symptoms of adrenergen.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin scarves in human breast milk, but in general, insulin occurs neither in breast milk, nor it is resorable after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical studies known of which undesired drugs are listed, sorted by system organs and ordered after decreasing of their departure (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silence, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, drowsiness, excessive dog, lack of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to continuously change the injection plant within the injection system, can occur in the result of a lipodystrophy on the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness may be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person, or by intravenous gift of glucose through a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the urine cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Ga- be occurs quicker in the response time and the effect of action is shorter than in hugely enough normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin-relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional blower glucose effect, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulism has a double-fast response rate as normal human insulin and achieves the full draught effect around 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was clearly shown that at an application of insulin ingisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postdenial glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin which will be given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin ingesisin 2 minutes before the meal was caught, a better post-dendenal control was given as with human normal insulin which was given for 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is angled in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is given as in human normal insulin which is 2 Mixed before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery for 15 minutes (GLULISIN: afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human norms, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) was given before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
