the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making these light available .
for further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; counter @-@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... open the card tools and select the required modules there .
this is a list with standard setup modules from the K@@ DE ; Ad@@ d@@ ons package . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have an additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can check the page , or the list of stor@@ ks , if present , extingu@@ ish .
the most promising filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filters &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are inter@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View may be graph@@ ically portra@@ yed with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose size is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the size of the sizes of the lower objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the size of the size of entries in it . consequently , large files can be detected , even then easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the right @-@ area meaningful and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view of color mode , may be either depth for easy detection of the yeast letters or the image of another file size , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can define if there is enough space available , or if the surface is provided by sub@@ ordin@@ ated juris@@ pru@@ dence ( whereby the error error may occur by restrictions at the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . moreover , you can define the relative position of the labelling in rect@@ angle .
in case of acceptance algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be held propor@@ tionally in the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always kept . please note that less space is lost for the frame , if the square is square .
as the division of the surface is carried out for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left . here it is for the labelling and to avoid space losses due to always beneficial to areas that are possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second allocation .
you can define the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent &apos;s entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

one easy to use camera interface is provided , so that you can download with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ p . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ tised ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera appears as a plate drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital kam@@ er@@ as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , advanced software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to host and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is now dated . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you can find a full list of supported cameras on this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be compiled with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . if the Ex@@ if support is provided by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the sc@@ andal . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will possibly be able to see anything else , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ tised ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ tised ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .

what is a digital Stock Management - off any part of the process of fashion ? digital Stock Management considers every part of the process , following the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , protect , use and use photos again . we will focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , rate , group@@ ing , secure , evaluate , play@@ ful , archi@@ ving , maintain and exp@@ orting the image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ urely , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ection@@ ated and exported content that hab@@ it a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data , to provide information on or documentation of other data , which are administr@@ ated by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t want to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ ad@@ ata to save very fast searching and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know what to do in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos are supposed to be able to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to change them on a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . these images can be found quickly via your location . if you make enough photos on the same place . if you are going enough photos , then you will be able to print sub@@ folder such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the setup site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tised ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget that , you can subsequently store the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into files by selecting the respective point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it provides &amp; digi@@ tised ; they provide a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real job , as you should now select any photo keywords , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can select all pictures that need the same attribute , and start the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s now proceed with keyword , key words , as you frequently do in other programs , or do categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; digi@@ tised ; automatically insert the pictures to the right place . the change of hier@@ archy in the tree is no problem and can easily be done by that of a bau@@ ms to another . the changed keywords are of &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while the sub@@ strate is pursued .
the graphics features like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscri@@ ptions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos only , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance it &apos;s not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one begins to dream , associations , the historical period is back again , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed its perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos is more important than the image itself to create a story . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer it to the viewer to help Him about the motive that you are moving about what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for themselves .
with &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as marking . you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously . K@@ DE can even export it to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you must tell the story so for the opening act no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already comes with light speed .
the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ alization are already countless and become even deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure to virtually repeat your travels through pictures with ge@@ ographic data . &amp; digi@@ tised ; can also be able to open the photos on the location . however , you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all amended versions , so also for works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tised ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ actor and Writ@@ ers ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographers , e.g. to protect the photographers , then the name of a company or organization should be used . after that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for the author of the author ) : linked to the author . this field includes titles of the photographer . examples of that can be titles as : employee photographer , free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be filled as well .
editors ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ ble field to identify who works this photo . if the photographer wants to be listed here . if the photographer has been listed here , you can see the picture here . if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group / agency is here indicated here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although those who have no protection against abuse . each of them has no more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , or modify . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important for this protection .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tised ; will be available in the near future such a module for the stac@@ king processing .
topics : record error , turn@@ out , power poles , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster pre@@ diction , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data restore company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must have to be treated more difficult and you can &apos;t have more expensive than a few years . of course , you can claim to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your measuring space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it turns a lot to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control box mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything related to CDs and DVDs was also true of course for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author trademark and then on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected . don &apos;t forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media .
dis@@ kette retain your statistics for itself . their manufacturer &apos;s designs include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ error study
in brief : dis@@ ks stay the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the lower temperature levels , the error rate increases dramatically . some of the SM@@ ART determined the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially literary and publishing groups . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also save data loss due to an blackout , but these losses usually allow themselves to recover without large problems .
while most electric devices do not make much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest assured . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . remember that not any plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention that protects the protection against lightning bolt and that protects properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage can be used to your computer , you should pay attention that also all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also suitable for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for the road .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in an inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ spann@@ ings , these devices can be able to store your data and load the system . some models allow them to work back until the power is running . some models allow them to be sure that they have the same quality requirements such as a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk of avoiding your computer system and compare his safety with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be done for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about your computer with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go into your holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup goal for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantities of data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is not available in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more at your disposal , in the case of Flick@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 a year , you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned up with the TCP protocol and included in the large companies offering a backup and a divi@@ der memory . therefore they are des@@ aster safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that you don &apos;t tell you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have been destroyed in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably safer data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are a further source for transmission rati@@ os because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not especially affected by transmission problems , you should see in the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can cope with turn@@ tables on low level and can be scal@@ able with a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the notebook and 46 % for the work@@ load systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft , or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the research process during a sudden inter@@ ruption in operation is higher and a defined status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main cause of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bling settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final results are more deterior@@ ated for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ Gb hard drive is responsible today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone affected by any data loss . so you &apos;ll be able to secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates , or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , you have a flash , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster strikes a local and destroys a lot . forget air@@ borne illness : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore , des@@ aster pre@@ ference is always not a local store . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a frequent reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are supposed to be secured . it is a moment of moments without a history and represents a complete copy of a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of files have been changed since the last complete system has been generated . this creates a complete moment @-@ up for two time points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
backup backup : a backup of files have been changed since last backup . this creates multiple moments . you can restore the original status to any time once again . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only constant and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , only the difference of files were really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for each month . every other th@@ inner should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , associated IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table , you need to consider and re @-@ evaluate everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to be considered a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years should have used yourself as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this does not mean actually .
let us assume that you have the scal@@ ability with you and the range you want to have on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and lay on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2 fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that van@@ ishes slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it can be los@@ s@@ less , but supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is needed , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and has a slow compression . this format would like to be able to save your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression s@@ mu@@ g ( Def@@ end ) . however , a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed free and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and obliged to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mix of XML and R@@ DF . file information is available with an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , but it can fit into problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the rough format will be able . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as containers and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which is a wide range of applications and modeling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . for so long the pictures are available on cam@@ am@@ edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive editing , you can use external programs . if you go again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ p . in the section adding a photos to an album you can find a description , how you can already add on your hard disk . but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album data .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and switch off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a Fer@@ tig -@@ indicator appears at the lower end and the th@@ umb@@ nails are displayed on the camera . if this is the case , file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed on each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a entry and met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that by some digital cameras no all information is available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the picture . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tised ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer , click the button to download and then download the selection of all your camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ tised ; we recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option with the default selection of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , use the button to download and then select selected . the button Selected combination is available as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available to download . these pictures have been selected until now . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in front window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you &apos;re using the buttons All or Selected combination , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed as normal folder . select the list of folders you can read in the section My Albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tised ; download photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the required photos , you can delete these from the camera . you can delete all of the camera by clicking the button Clear . if you only want to delete , you need to select this first and then delete the chosen chosen .
please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera . so the photos will not be deleted in the tr@@ ash of &amp; K@@ DE ; they should be carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera image , you should make this faster , since this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames as fil@@ en@@ ames . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used once again after the photos taken from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image was done in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ory @-@ based support . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options while transfer@@ ring three more options to be done before the photos will be stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the author &apos;s ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all the downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ iz@@ ations , you should read the help of command @-@ time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in case letters when you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tised ; for a photo is displayed below the name , which shows the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are stored and automatically using , if you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; can use any information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic speed during heart failure . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information you embedded into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , then &amp; digi@@ tised ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic speed , use the button Ex@@ tended and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera is information about the date , which the photo was made , can &amp; digi@@ tised ; this sub@@ strate is based on image data . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same under@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information can be embedded into the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , stores &amp; digi@@ p ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to expand this option . use the button Advanced and select the option file @-@ based support at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer on their camera is the button to download . select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can select the files you should be uploaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the selection is done , prompt &amp; digi@@ tised ; you , where the pictures should be loaded up . select the desired folder and press OK to download the upload . pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as general concept in this document . thus , a position meant , which can be displayed in length and latitude . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphic an area due to automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten the photo , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to loc@@ alise the location of the photos , or simply add this aspect , it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has supported many GPS data fields , such as direction , ar@@ el@@ ites and cards refer@@ enced . directly with the correct hardware , via a detection of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well known places .
as far as we know , there are no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , however , you need to save this data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format to support the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and GPS , and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make a g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of liable ordin@@ ates that are produced for map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu . you can set up on these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action can be set on single @-@ scale preview or image editing can be set . they lay down the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised ; note , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ identity and copyright data . these data will automatically be selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected for downloading the camera interface . even in a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
car title is a syn@@ onym for the author of the author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as specified photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is an additional description to the author , this is also necessary to be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is an news agency , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a bearing picture , the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this means that met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the image and not only entered the database of &amp; digi@@ tised ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
image labelling as embedded fittings ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you are reviewed in the pictures . attention : in pictures , which included already inscri@@ ptions , these are over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ tised ; over@@ written .
the Settings page contains all the options for information that appear when the mouse pointing at the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can add the file extension of this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ tised ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who has no such enhanc@@ ements , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised ; igno@@ res .
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the ligh@@ thouses are set on this page . however , if you then open the illumin@@ table , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get ready for fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this picture mode can be inserted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for this statement .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG needs more time to output and un@@ packing . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
using the T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press , you can switch the Def@@ late -@@ compression sal@@ g@@ ings in T@@ IF@@ F pictures . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it has no influence on image quality , since the def@@ ending @-@ algorithm is maintenance @-@ free .
with the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss of loss , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was posted , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning process .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tised ; image editing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops rapidly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , use this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid samples with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the bald output is used . otherwise , when set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . by using the second sensors , the effect will be able to receive more details in four steps more details . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are burned , because of the in@@ ability of your camera shows the brigh@@ ter white in the settings . finally , use a certain unusual results , since it displays the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ ens .
this is possible since blue pixels in general does not feel so fast satisfied as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much color or white you want .
if you choose the option re@@ design , you get the possibility to put a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted to each image .
place the lumin@@ ance value for your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ tised ; -@@ image processing is made . in order to keep time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ we should be conservative .
a demo @-@ ti@@ ghtness algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle figures that have many cameras and that provides a Matrix coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ w comes with three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it looks like if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue fre@@ ading values here . this is surely the best method for a color way correction is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and returns as we should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tised ; information such as the color information from one color space to the other , so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions , if a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder S@@ etting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the ability &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the rough file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures are not administr@@ ated the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the cam@@ per@@ er and model that you can use . not all profiles are contained in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any color mapping or G@@ amm@@ ac@@ or@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not require to conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your photo is printed on a tool , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of leaving your printer on a blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles the fit together . this response is un@@ official :
the Canon profiles extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface supporting by a range of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewing and image processing is supported . many modules have been written to collabor@@ ate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . you will then select one list of available modules , and these modules will appear as new entries in the main menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can set in the menu under settings short command .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the di@@ asch@@ au settings should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ators adjust the time between image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross@@ roads switch the met@@ ad@@ ata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics show a list of all the cameras on the left side . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , be switched on and in image mode . you are currently serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom of the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have an US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera &apos;s camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , specify where you hanging your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ tised ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have installed your camera , your camera appears in the camera &apos;s camera .
you can select any identification card for your camera . if you have more than one camera in the menu , you can insert any more than one camera .
with the acknowle@@ d@@ gement dialog for editing &gt; Images in the Mül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the del@@ eting of a photos in an album , you can find further details in the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes by the right side bar can be tac@@ itly charged by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any refund . otherwise , you must use the amend@@ ments to the button changes .
you can also sign the monitor screen from &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the beginning , it acceler@@ ates the starting procedure of &amp; digi@@ tised ; .
the attitude of both searching for new photos are looking for &amp; digi@@ tised ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ tised ; if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ tised ; you know if it should be extingu@@ ished out of the database .
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can use the main window to your taste . these settings can choose among settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tised ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the updated advertisement / Edit .
the image editing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised ; you are therefore not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can set up in the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ames , magni@@ fying factor , and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
you should possibly edit a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as .
as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the File Recovery or button the button to restore image editing in the tool bar . you then lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store .
almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Return or re@@ produced by selecting the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to return and get C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ change @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool@@ bar you can press a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between is also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the photo editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image height , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full @-@ Mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar code . if you don &apos;t want this , you can modify this in the setup dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can call this out of the &amp; digi@@ tised ; main window . see the section for setting the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the image file image and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or full sentences . all image viewing pages can select from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and exp@@ ose print assist@@ ent . if you follow the wi@@ zard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation components , even in image processing . it will appear when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ cks on the same rider can appear on the side@@ bar or disappear again in the rim .
in the inscri@@ ptions of the text , you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . it means that all the special characters are allowed to use in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and want to use special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you have said it , you can either use the button to use or switch to the next image , the inscri@@ ptions are then stored .
besides the user @-@ button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . but you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . but this will always be performed if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings , which is always written in the pictures .
the section assessment shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate more pictures simultaneously , select these from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering of the keywords , the keyword tree and a box box with the previously in this &amp; digi@@ tised ; -@@ meeting requested keyword .
the keyword tree is adapted to the given search word . you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief at the input of keyword in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding suit areas in the tree . all key words of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field of Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filters .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - file , keyword and search results . if in addition , one or more keyword filter from the right is used , only the cutting amount of these are displayed . all displayed keywords are available .
you can also draw and off . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialogue you asks if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is selected on no keyword , which was selected to three pictures . they were taken with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then there was a keyword from the right sample tree to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
these search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on settings different .
if you have a rule with and create and notice that it should be one or should be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
you can define a Advanced search of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I used it mainly to &amp; digi@@ tised ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason why to insert a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photographic or sc@@ anned colors . using a color @-@ managed workflow , you can make sure that colors on your monitor or scanners are making the colors you print or publish the colors from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons must be expressed for the results that he wants to express . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orials is sufficient to provide sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informal decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image flows are fulfilled every six listed criteria , you don &apos;t need to take care of color management .
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ colour space . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image spending is via e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so , if s@@ RGB does so well and life for all so easy , why should I use another colour space , so that your thoughts may have to do with color spo@@ ils ?
a visual example of lim@@ iting s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours which can be seen , the hu@@ ff @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colours , you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click on information and then on information About RGB working rooms .
do I have to set my monitor on my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you need to monitor your monitor using the circle . if you use your monitor on s@@ RGB , then you &apos;ll need to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard to use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the standardi@@ zation of norm@@ alize , identical , automatic and contrast expand from the menu auto @-@ correction , try automatically to make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , which seems best at your photo .
norm@@ alize this method sc@@ aled the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sha@@ ding . this function is often a mag@@ ical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
compar@@ ing : this method refers to the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity is as flat as possible . this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonder at a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast enlar@@ ges : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values in between in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the White House of &amp; digi@@ tised ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted as a colour space with 8 @-@ bit color . if you can do so far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you are working on the white frame in rough mode , which can be used in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will be better to correction .
this tool is based on a white bal@@ sam@@ pled by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . they start it on the menu entry colors white from the image processing .
the front window can be adapted to the size , both the original picture and the preview of the target picture . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ ers is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynam@@ ically changed , once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the Shadow Adju@@ st@@ ment allows you to improve the att@@ est details of your photos or download .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the image show around the colour temperature of the white @-@ scale . this type will also be set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the survi@@ ving indicator indicator increases the colors , when more than a color channel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this will appear in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as well as loading exactly this . any setting of the white comparison that you have set you can save in a text file and then load again later .
the button pre@@ ferences makes all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white @-@ off . note that even neutral settings will be given another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image is changed .
you can adjust here the code depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires even more record field , calculation time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG available .
this tool opens the same dialogue , such as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ strate for the use of color profiles . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can draw the text of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of ton@@ al correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction . in the manual for key correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool color effects provides you four colour effects , a solar control effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ ari@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was the effect of the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier of the additional light . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors have been inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally produced as a negative image that is not designed to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . he differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for a daylight optim@@ istic colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who barely complete landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ ction . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filters can give the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contra@@ indications of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are happy with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you can make a photo at bad light conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of them . all changes you can carry out in the preview . if Him you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ y / contrast / Gamma , the tool is based on this tool very complicated . even if the dialog can be complicated to this tool , you need only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphite , three sli@@ ders are stuck inside and the right side can change to the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controls and make sure the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this box box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures , the linear hist@@ ogram is commonly dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three controls : the top for the dark shades , the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original photos in order to automatically adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output : the output values allow the selection manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output values as with the input values . for example , compression is used as a background to create something different in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values will automatically be placed in depen@@ dency of the image values .
save as and shop : stored in the fil@@ esystem , stored and re@@ charged in the fil@@ esystem , and then the Gimp format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows , means and sun stock . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ an indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example for the alignment of the input used on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and correct image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modification channel : this box box allows to specify the channel which is changed by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the linear mode provides a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a student to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark expressions are corresponding , and the corresponding picture pixel can be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking , a matching line is displayed on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : using these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that creates you can be saved in the file system and later is loaded . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
if you create this method and the three color@@ pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the Red , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ an indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected at the lumin@@ aire channel . shadow and Sonn@@ ent@@ ö@@ ne has been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color descriptions of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window is showing you a preview of the window . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ ers . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are right down : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to keep these channels . if you want to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , it is particularly convenient if you are able to reduce the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel mixer is able to generate great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color appears to a visible noise that occurs in colour channel and their noise pattern in every channel is different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ ing first .
storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any automatic mixer setting allows you to store and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ an indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture displayed in the blue channel . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . the development of digital photography is black / white a job step , since color pictures can be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profile .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film supply with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scen@@ eries and fits especially well @-@ portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film supply with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ ang@@ ter .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic movement effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light to the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates warm bright and medium tones that add a little cold into the sha@@ d@@ ons . this is very similar to the process of execution of a pressure and the development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image can be used for it .
relief : shift this parameter after the right increases the note of the depth and three dimensional qualities of texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . a possibility of keeping its attention is to keep the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under image frame , the module can be started out of the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you put the image type with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ bs it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , reverse it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting for a button and decor@@ atively adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the value area for width is 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple one @-@ format text in a picture of any item . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive . simply type the text , and place it with the mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the larger the image , the larger must be the character set . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
every setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image was saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil to apply to a template .
the menu painting sten@@ cil to be used in image processing can be used to put templates on an image .
for sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to change the file size of the template . if you need to add an email to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ p @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time you need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root canal was placed for sten@@ cils , a supervision which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is enlarged the under@@ lying picture . it is cent@@ ered in the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . if you want to use the template &apos;s position . if you want to use the template to the whole image , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move under the template &apos;s image . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the front size .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . it actually sharp@@ ens it no bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang .
Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correc@@ t@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution , so that the same phenomenon can be printed along with only minimal differences . SLR cameras usually require more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than ordinary cameras for the private users .
JPEG image often has a camera of internal sharp@@ ening . images in the rough format must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners turn a sharp@@ ening device already during reading the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening factory withdrawal . you can upgrade to the menu entry .
they should not be careful when the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the usable technique is re@@ frac@@ tive . you can obtain more information about the menu entry . below Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to record a little soft is much easier than it . use the tool for a soft mark with the menu entry and experiment something with settings . the window window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove mu@@ gs from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the picture . the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried first . if you make the need@@ ful mask to make , noise and impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius poses as many pixel on each side of a channel affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ als . they should therefore sharp@@ est pictures of the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the use differential . it can therefore define a minimal difference in order to be applied for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of sharp@@ ens and therefore pure @-@ law in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ rade ; tools Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze re@@ foc@@ ates a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ focus quot ; in which it makes the de@@ oc@@ ative approach . this is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters . they can usually start better results than in@@ sharp . you can start it from the menu by calling colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze in the image processing .
in practice the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ß @-@ folding . the Gau@@ ß @-@ folding has a very long tail , which is far from the source pix@@ ies , which is far from the original qu@@ ail . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is influenced by the distant pixels , which causes un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the main parameters for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value is 1 good results . you can make a higher value if your image should be very sharp , but then pay attention to notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0,1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is very bad . if the noise filter is very bad . an usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still missing .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is caused . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you have a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase correlation and / o@@ der@@ mal filters .
match size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . however , note the size of the match size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . if you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitr@@ ary parameters which you have set is stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all access , color and intensity correc@@ tions to the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that many operations will not be visible immediately , but later left un@@ comfortable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and compressed images , eg . JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ et produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by causing un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of uncertainty . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for further information on the methods of sharp@@ ening correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator is the sharp@@ est of the range of the trunk , in order to create a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the colour table allows a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts associated with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings .
detail contain@@ ment p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass rate over the picture . a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the details should always be submitted .
weight depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth in all directions while a value is close to one direction only in one direction . if you have a film body or CCD noise will create a high value of cell @-@ like pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best at a value close to 1 .
fl@@ att@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this defines the maximum smoo@@ thing factor . therefore , set the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
re@@ petitions : how often the algorithm is run through . usually here is 1 or 2 .
angle step@@ ping distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : el@@ ong@@ ings integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen , there should be too small . be sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral pac@@ emaker in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More to Quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small . but he doubles the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it to release him .
the buttons save as well as loading exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be re@@ charged .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last long last and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used in a photo that was used in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black Art@@ ef@@ act in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; smokers is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides chosen image filter to remove patches , and other arti@@ facts which are coming from dust or hair on the lens , can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects from sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ci@@ ble noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel . the color indicated above the image and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thereby creating minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance to the front in front of light changes . if the value is increased , smoking filters will need to re@@ adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubric@@ ating again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response is removed or noise can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas , which typically become stronger , however , also the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance is re@@ acts . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear at the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
store under and loading : these buttons are exactly used for this . all parameters for space reduction that you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) . the ro@@ uting was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen the picture is much easier than one image . use the tool for a soft mark with the menu entry and experiment with the glasses . the front view on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ red arti@@ facts , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes that emerge in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised digit@@ alised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the con@@ tours and thereby maintains the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the texture is developed with another tool , the image error correction , performed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ um and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pres@@ sive compression s@@ mu@@ g , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and shop exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ oring can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last long last and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can be restored like a photo with equ@@ för@@ mig@@ es noise .. The module is applied to an Il@@ ford ( TM ) hp @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grains on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo rest@@ oring . this time , tex@@ tures can be found on an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner , which can be seen with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ rade ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove hot@@ pixel from photos that have to remove eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem with high @-@ quality rough mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the button dark image . the tool will be automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture shows .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to connect the dark picture directly to the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image . please note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and will automatically charge this in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the window window shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ fac@@ tions .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ch : it is determined on average of neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is allocated to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 pixel block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
square : this is the standard fil@@ tration method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , out of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ ment , i.e. exposed corners to correct the image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , in particular the medium and large photo format , can often reduce the entire sensor area not evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reaching the light that reaches the sensor . Tel@@ e@@ objective also show this behavior .
but he also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ ser , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lens should also be used , even with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects are created by movement .
with the wide exposure of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by sim@@ ulated a equivalent transformation to a rough image that is applied without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i correction is applied to an image of Cent@@ er@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ work@@ correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light output levels at the point of the largest density the felt . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly a light intensity of 2 , ent@@ sp@@ richt@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a little degree of Vig@@ net@@ scape .
leuk@@ starch , contrast , and gamma settings : the processor &apos;s image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ lt correction reduces the lumin@@ ance of the target image using these options . controls only positive values available , as you have to increase the settings only .
if you want a fine re@@ load of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing out of the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ment correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ment in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture has been carried out on the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Lin@@ ear di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lentils on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion . colour@@ ing di@@ stortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second @-@ degree handles the general geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but it laughs at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of coefficient corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical di@@ stortion is almost eliminated almost .
general : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped di@@ stortion is corrected and positive values kis@@ ses @-@ shaped di@@ stortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion fourth degree . this value seems stronger in the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse hall@@ mark of the parameter .
zoom : this value determines the image size and leads through a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image size .
bright : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview of dist@@ orted correction . values which you use for your image will be stored and used as default values .
the tons or cus@@ hion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out prior to all cutting or size changes . if you want to re @-@ cut this correction than all the first . if you have a photo @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be the effect of the fal@@ ter .
to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool bar and horizontal aux@@ ili@@ ary line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the tons / cus@@ hion di@@ stortion with the help of the lines .
if you corrected a ver@@ ge @-@ shaped di@@ stortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation cutting out of the image processing or using the zoom kno@@ b .
for most images , the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some images such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so that all angles in the image will have 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight di@@ stortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org site which is re@@ produced under this URL . filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust the fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of the color of green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter paint can@@ als are mi@@ stre@@ ated to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to turn the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming effect on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) . the film &apos;s sensitivity was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ lich@@ és .
the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; filter film grains is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer great silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the fil@@ ming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ iny appearance , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , if you need more grains , so you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film @-@ based effects on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ rade ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and style live well for this effect .
there are two controls in order to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick pain@@ t@@ brush can be better suited for big images . fl@@ att@@ ening controls the ice or , from the other hand , the hin@@ ts .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the work is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and plain 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter charcoal drawing used colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ ized design . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start making .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top controls cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( edge ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ rade ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ rade ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ty landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using di@@ stortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ e@@ ders 1 : share the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an artwork using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe out the picture along steep lines that go out of a centre . this is sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture by turning the pixel to a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ pe the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focus camera . the object seems back to the background .
movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft drawing : wi@@ ped the picture soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shining soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
bulk soli@@ ds : wi@@ pes the picture by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the uncertainty of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent uncertainty : finds the color basin in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate calculation and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel these calculation anytime with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ he@@ ather protected algorithm .
the dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the image . since the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the drop of drops on the image .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing a range of Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a face that will remain freely . if you start the filters off Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelves felt . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through spi@@ ke or turning into the right orientation . the tools you can find in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers Spi@@ ral .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase the photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture of shr@@ ug@@ ging is simple . the big question is how can you find a picture above ? how can you find out the missing information ? how can you find out the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and specify the destination values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation for the enlarge of the image . &amp; digi@@ tised ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size , and are listed below :
aspect ratio maintain : if this setting is enabled , the size ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons save as well as loading are used exactly . any inser@@ tion for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it may take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by expanding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
the cutting of photos is not only a run @-@ run operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the mouse is simply just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . this allows you to change the size of the necessary area by pulling in the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can simply create a new rect@@ angle by using the mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button the button button of the image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save to the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the front section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in dialogue remains unchanged .
in accordance with aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and cross @-@ section format is assigned to width .
the tool is using aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons to cut the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you see the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the image and not the original image .
the settings of the composition help allow you to da@@ zzle , so that you can put your pictures better . these Help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , harmon@@ ic triangles are an option to split a rect@@ angle in a harmon@@ ious triangle .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth pattern , such as spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings , and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two numbers . the above @-@ standing divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition is considered as a visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents liquid aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . these Help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ thirds , the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads to the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angle of golden spiral , also called gold right corner . this rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used to handle the golden spiral . this can be a line with or different objects . this one can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden triangles also deri@@ ve from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ alled triangles . diagonal to leave these lines can be seen as a st@@ ati@@ cal object dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame , create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . select transformation free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can reset the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top .
to your help , the Free press module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointing to the picture table . after you can fix it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in the previous section .
after you have shot an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers cut from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option is smoo@@ ther the picture a bit after the rotation . please note , however , the above warning .
all per@@ mitting transform@@ ations are carried out to a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be charged automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which you can help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
corner left above : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angles right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
corner left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
corner right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the image becomes a little emb@@ ell@@ ished . this effect is small , but two adjust@@ ments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you will get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some this is the image using transformation cutting out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture becomes dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers .
make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you push for default , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the objective will be displayed on the right .
to your help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the lock , the image becomes a little bit wis@@ ely . this effect is generally neg@@ li@@ gible , but two scra@@ m@@ ings are twice as much s@@ wis@@ ely and therefore you should avoid this .
after scrat@@ ching , the painting has un@@ nice triple holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate this is the image using transformation cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and , in some cases where these libraries were comp@@ ili@@ zed . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised ;
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F below .
&amp; digi@@ rade ; shows only files in formats that knows . this happens in the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ plug ; accept . in the section configuration , you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedure on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s may also save loss @-@ free when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource @-@ format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ Image Converter of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised ; .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; does the loading of raw pictures only supported with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tised ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ tised ; supported :
many digital cameras will support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . if you don &apos;t understand film editing software and , therefore , no built @-@ in possibilities will display or edit them . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ p ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use the program to launch the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you can exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the white module white .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ tised ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft characters , noise soft@@ ening , re@@ frac@@ tive , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform di@@ alog@@ ical type before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison list of the pre@@ fix area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected curtain range .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected curtain range .
divide ver@@ tically . the left section shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the felt .
split horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the front area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn off to show over and sub@@ jection . the used colors can be adapted to the general setup site .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from a preview . you can view this frame with the mouse inside the picture and see on the part of the picture you want to see . preview in the left section of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower right corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module are noticed .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting of photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . check out all pictures within this coordinates are displayed and displayed . naturally , you advance your images Geo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application may be used to edit colour pallets and to select and ren@@ ame colors .
the pallets are installed by &amp; K@@ DE , either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case you are in your personal file for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , they can select from a list of installed pallets , or search the folder according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line . it can be moved by being cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ etten@@ view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with supp@@ ressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if cur@@ sor cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted in either the color panel on the cur@@ sor . the color becomes either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . you can adjust this mode by selecting the cross@@ box revision under the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created so in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a tick @-@ end characters if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the p@@ allet and the output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you &apos;ll find it on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graphic ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are available in science , particularly in computer science , and so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs , the &amp; graphic design ; programs , the &amp; graph ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . graphic programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; programme in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( thus a change in Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph is re@@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; Compon@@ ent in an &amp; Kate ; Compon@@ ent
loading of large Graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which uses the &amp; graph ; tools &amp; dot ; for presentation of graph@@ s required . in detail are required :
the main window shows the opened graphite , each in its own window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graph , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list , click on the first icon to display the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner , if the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without any special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction in a graph .
if the just in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , it can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu option settings ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph file outside of ongoing &amp; cal@@ c@@ viewer ; instance , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; ch@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to be able to open the current instance in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can store your choice permanently , but these are also compatible with the setup dialog .
during the program start , you can open all graph@@ s your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the Gra@@ ph should be divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose if the parts of the graph@@ s will come on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again gives the possibility to establish the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ loading or ignore the changes ) or program the program every time .
the page opening provides the ability to determine the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if a Gra@@ ph will be opened out of a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the page seat management provides the opportunity to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up . you can define a standard behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine , at any start , be asked .
the context menu , usually with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opened further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graphic ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for geri@@ zed Graph@@ ene . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of oriented graphite . the algorithm lays down the edges to the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible .

to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ sigh@@ ted dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you have to download a possible correlation with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded with an automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS sp@@ inning data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera will be converted to the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation indicates a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . lies the devi@@ ation among them , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any column data from one place , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this field .
the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this boundaries here and then push the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ating can also be found and set up with the shown map and increase it . select the region and increase your accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to the version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is coded UTF @-@ 8 to enable a best @-@ term internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings . you only need to select these albums . the albums will not choose from hier@@ arch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the range , it will be displayed quickly and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely expl@@ aining each page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored in all your images . select a folder on which you have typ@@ ing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . the size of the file size does not affect the file size . all other settings are explained by themselves .
the rider instruc@@ tors allow you to watch some of the settings from the album Reiter for front pictures , these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . push the break down to break the process .
if the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages , to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press the link to close the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the dialog .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can use a background color for the dialog box . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you must first select the pictures that are packed into the m@@ peg di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create m@@ peg m@@ asch@@ au ex@@ tras .
the pictures selected from you are displayed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sorting images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning the file on a TV set , you &apos;ll need to use the respective TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is defined by it . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt she should set them black . the name and the path of the generated file can set you under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you have adapted all the settings your wishes , you can now use the output of the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now eat fast or in all the rest of a coffee , and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via button settings right below .
the print assistant allows several pictures to print on a leaf paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ amy . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print it with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original copy of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings to the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are used for the white balance . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can save one of the three output formats and save the extension of the file . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you need to edit your pictures frequently or do not use the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use the break .
the stac@@ king @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to once . so , use this mode , for example , if you are sure to test with a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures . however , this is helpful if these were generated in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available yet . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all pictures in an album . it uses the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the game .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the image of the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image below or enlarge . there are four types of image change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image screen size .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed at this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can set the print solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance . more pictures can draw on the list of some pictures and place there .
after you started the module , the pictures window with selected images will be displayed . over the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file extension dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right page will be displayed .
you can also draw pictures on the image list and add there to add the list of the images added to the list .
with the button pictures , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of some pictures .
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message to your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . the pictures from you selected pictures are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails , if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time it is used again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the correct path for your installation in your input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the di@@ alling code of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you choose JPEG image format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , in search of errors , watch . their e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose , you can sh@@ ew this window ? en .
after the launch of the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between selected and all pictures of this album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option is enabled to use very elegant image processes using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the seal will be very slow .
the file names will show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the left corner displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . after that , you can manually break with Es@@ c .
the option pictures randomly choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
in delay between the pictures , the temporary distance between the single images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effects . you should show that before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . randomly cho@@ oses any transition between the pictures .
during Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar on the left side of the left side . move the mouse in this corner to turn you .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and restart , jump to the previous and next image jumping and stop di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left side of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo album ; see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , now in any group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords are present .
in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have received your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at your hard drive and of course the current presentation pictures . in the following , each is described for yourself .
if you push the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only images are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have chosen all the people , places and other settings , you can view images to look at the pictures of your effici@@ encies .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , for each person a self @-@ looking picture , this applies also to places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture .
to display pictures beside the names , select the button , which you want to be right outside on the tool bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . it has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keyword ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures ) .
however , you need to define what image for each individual will be displayed . in order to view this , you will need to select the image section window ( in closer ) and select the image section for the corresponding person . in the case window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes , and select which part of the picture should be displayed and cut off .

with the options in the bottom part of the window you can search all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here becomes pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; and look at the quick @-@ speed , screen photographs and entry videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for the first time start , or select a few sample pictures and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an inter@@ related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the tim@@ eline bar here . as the name suggests , this glue shows you data about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . every glue then shows another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the LEICA only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively using the following ways : you can select the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time data will draw . if you select a range , you &apos;ll just view pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user hand , the integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version you can create about the HTML menu .
before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each area will be accurately described .
first , enter the title of the title and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo album ; HTML example @-@ pages see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file will be created on the viewing site . you will find detailed information about the export files you will find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer . for example , that &amp; k@@ photo album are obvious here . for example , you can &apos;t use all pictures exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures before a certain amount .
in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most adju@@ sting possibilities are unique , which is why not specifically received .
down on the page you can set different resolutions on the pictures . this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore get your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , and if it would like to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and URL where your website is stored .
best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each successive proposition a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added at the next time . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you &apos;re really looking for viewing a URL . if you have been created for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files are not in the final target file you will need to copy them there . so the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder are located .
the just described installation possibilities have included all three on base ord@@ ner or UR@@ Ls . in these cases a sub@@ folder is created , whose name is set in the output file .
if you are looking at a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you have already done a lot of time for viewing the pictures , you &apos;ll need to apply at the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo album ; this work is not even going to do this job .
with &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other data in your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it , whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images . the advantage all pictures have been together , and this file may be so independent . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file search the pictures on two times . first , the pictures are not found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export images are described , which can export to the File menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im -@@ files . there are the following three selection options available :
in the manual manual , copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copying the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most pictures have been compressed using JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not compressed to com@@ press the files . if you want it , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is limited to the image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you want to limit the images otherwise very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select &amp; k@@ photo album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you are person@@ able to person@@ alize the category persons of the resulting file ( if you are a Danish ) while this category is required during your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported into your database and which categories do this in your database .
in the fourth step you can use the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse pictures and look at : when you see pictures , you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see a picture of your friend on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will see the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the searches and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but it also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; store all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male security tools , copy on a disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where you would like .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this with future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings , set up ... enter into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained to the various installation possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call a preview and options for viewing . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can define for each image various features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog box used to process existing groups already . for any existing group , you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue Op@@ tions , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a Mitt@@ gli@@ eds as stated in .
you can see the installation possibilities that are available to you with the list of members . in the left list box , you can select the category . in the left window , a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; its mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin interface . please find information on the Ki@@ pi website .
the modules can be accessed by the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together with multiple applications , it may be that the modules are using &amp; k@@ photo album ; you should always test new modules using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or call the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would have not warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that are also called K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo album ; this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo album ; the current album that &apos;s simply the current view , so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to pass on ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here is &amp; k@@ photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example all persons , then every entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for Virtual albums , i.e. , for example , use the category persons , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would have selected persons to view , and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select the modules , which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . at the moment , there are no more information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , now just click on the record pictures that shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes on the picture , where the image has been recorded on the picture , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures are recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by using individuals , places and words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the images within the list : if you have a family celebration and pictured on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names can be moved to above , find the characters faster and allocated .
if you prefer to receive an alphabetical list , click on the symbol for sorting according to date .
if you have chosen remarks on each image , you may need to edit all selected images and provide these pictures with notes . in this case , click on the right side and back @-@ buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the top .
if you have several pictures , for example , with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and provide the menu option of multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a standard , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transition or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry to a category and place there to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is ahead to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see .
you can shift the individual elements of the package by clicking and shift the edges of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a separate window by adding it out of the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you click on the button options ... which offers you the option to store the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you would like to check out this window later , use the button options ... and here window a / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you do not have filters . for example , you can see here . you can configure the size of the front pictures , by simply down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created .
you can also delete images in the picture show . select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removal key or select in the menu Edit menu . now you will display the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures stored on the hard disk . of course you have to view the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures with which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the fore@@ front pictures are available , so that &amp; k@@ photo album can show you the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it again . if you want to avoid the insert of your images , please get a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , click on privacy . alternatively , you can also un@@ lock all pictures you can see for others . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister , control and select the menu entry all except above view .
so , you have set what pictures in the case of the F@@ alles should be hidden . if you just give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so if you want to get locked out the pictures you want to get out . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to establish a password that needs to be entered into un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , just select password menu .
please remember that this picture protection is not sure about the hard drive and the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete this type of password protection . this type of password protection is intended to convert those who are with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not very familiar , to convert the view to private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures featuring &amp; k@@ photo album ; it &apos;s natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo album has to be viewed . this is why you can start a picture _ and video viewer . this can be described from the preview as described in .
the viewer you can see in . it &apos;s of course the picture , but additional information you need to enter on the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure them with the mouse and you can also configure which information is displayed and if available at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you choose people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in viewer , you can switch between them and go back by running the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in viewer , you can run these as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo album ; then you can download a new picture after a few seconds . as frequently there is a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped g@@ ash@@ au through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to change the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete room on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the image and look out in the picture , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us key , you can check out zo@@ oming the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of Zo@@ oma .
with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the t@@ ear@@ head paste the zo@@ oms , so every Pixel on the screen is equivalent to a pixel &apos;s pixel .
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and min@@ it@@ aste .
with the functions from the context menu you can rotate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes about the current picture with the menu view from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person , whose name you can have forgotten the image and configuration dialog of the image . in the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you &apos;re looking one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while you can view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in see a picture , where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have further features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have selected all pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and features can be shown in the front view , then you can add features to the pictures by pressing just the letter for the feature , after the image was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo album to paint on the picture .
the same old will not be saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can reverse it later .
in you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo album ; click on the image paint from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ fashioned ; work , you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire view .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of one already selected object , as all objects already are selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either to insert a menu in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following serial menu will be built , so that you can select the right position :
with extinction either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on users to adopt these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then , you can cancel the input error , and reset the changes with breaking down .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; file documentation in setting dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed property .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL @-@ user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you can edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ profit view .
press preview in the self @-@ friendly view and a small example of the scene is described with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture will be selected , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire view . this cross marked the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window .
each object has an visibility level . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are then displayed only if they are selected or the visibility level of small or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can save them any way . you can also store multiple shut@@ down orders and change between different orders .
to anchor a window on or below a view , pull the block to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , pull the instructions on the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view , and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views over each other , pull the facade in the middle of another view . you can then switch between Vi@@ ews through clicking on the views above in the views above .
the last possible wind@@ ow@@ els are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring place , drag the pre@@ ference to the desktop or click on the top left pointing arrow on top .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the collection bar . to prevent the switch , click on the little square between arrow and cross .
you can add extra views to the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sli@@ p@@ tive , you can anchor it to any location .
the current window view can save you with view window orders ... store . it will display a dialog box in which you can save the window orders under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be correct . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
an R@@ ender @-@ Mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview of up to full photos in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog :
any R@@ ender @-@ Mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode .
in the box card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can choose the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is generated with only one beam of pixels , various errors can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or window effects in ben@@ ds and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature is better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel will always be split up again and adap@@ tive because each pixel will depend on calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray takes a beam of pixels , then both pixels are processed by using a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel will be divided individually , and the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be checked with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light refle@@ ctions . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this box card you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels are supposed to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams have no object taken .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; option to import the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er supports ; yet not the full range of command from &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; please write these sources between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , check the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and insert into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; a scene ren@@ ames . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help menu , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Doc@@ umentation to the displayed property . set here the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ titudes ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files , do not have the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used to display selected controls .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera &apos;s view and in the window type label .
you can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can set the push @-@ up separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and turn@@ outs .
larger values produce an exact wire model and therefore a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the sphere you can set the detail stage for two directions .
if you cross a detailed projection for extended projections , all wire model views are used further , if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , a floor appears below the objects . the ground is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you want to check the edge of edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precisely , please refer to the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , how you can create and save window orders .
the combination field of the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of handmade window orders shows all existing window orders . you can add a new arrangement with button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can create with the button add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with box card , shared the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; installed and now you would like to follow any more exact knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a sphere on a plane .
but you should carefully note the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules for ren@@ dering will be applied as a result , you receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and just get a black image .
if you have everything f@@ law@@ lessly installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; the following pre @-@ set window orders :
take a bit of time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should note the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry , so you have now a scene without objects .
the wire view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you create . in particular , note that in the fourth wireless model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s view@@ point . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of view object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in the user @-@ documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change anything on the basic settings of the camera , but note that you can change the camera in the list of control points with which you can change the target point of the camera , with the left mouse button on one control point and drag it to the desired spot .
if you push the button of users or the SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E , the wire model views and the object tree instantly changes these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s view@@ point .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ able body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as bottom :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button to use or the ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire view shows also the level , even though at the moment only as limited end@@ able level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you are looking for the object tree , you will find that you can click the entry for each new object . in this case , you can only see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the ground to introduce its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the name in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material because you can still need settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t look any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are using a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you &apos;ll need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to specify two new attributes ( you can also do this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently but the chess board color list may only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select the colors each time and change the colors in view of the object characteristics :
you should already be able to execute this step , as you have to understand the basic mode of work by &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E or button to press ) , so that the ball is ho@@ vering over the ground , as you have moved the floor to bottom down a unit .
of course , ren@@ dering now makes a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . place a suitable material in the following step .
if you choose the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as already at the bottom , type the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select the colors and adjust the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to introduce some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or press ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E .
the at@@ titudes of gloss effect and reflection reveal some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; we hope you have already learned so much you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the ren@@ ders hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene , and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye to see the scene . without a light source , you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene is supposed to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; created
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu , and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space .
rest@@ art@@ ing the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have stored changes in the scene .
repeat the latest revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used editing .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog box in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard root and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ ts ; modify commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog for setting the tool bar . you can add and remove this option tool@@ box for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands and remove instructions .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to finish rough surfaces , without any hi@@ ves on the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , through use of an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can choose images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . if a matching file name was found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; there are five cart@@ on cards . in three of them , general and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the mode of mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with background color , which can set you down below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow .
with this option , &amp; ball show ; at the end of the last folder folder . at the next start &amp; ball show ; this folder opened in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is added to large images the display windows on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
determines if the sli@@ deshow starts with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image change at a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is broken down from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different business cards of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; short instructions for display windows and short commands for the browser window .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ day view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short position .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short position .
shows presentation pictures for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short position .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is also closed when no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only sensible if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ arrived ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; it is &amp; show@@ ring ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to contribute its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; it makes you just as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you use this , your browser opens a page to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is completed and you can simply follow the guide to pass your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you want to answer each user &apos;s user mail@@ ing@@ list and show you soon . if you wish to answer any questions from other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list however , you should be powerful this language .
the best start to participate in and show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . guide to the developer of the developer mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ picture ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access this settings , you have to set up on this settings . you can set up on this settings . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the scope of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the lower or transmission inde@@ xes is selected . skill should display the colors with what you are supposed to stand in contrast . under@@ supplies should display a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions at the selected pictures . you can also see this page bar in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than pictures and res@@ ins .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and retri@@ eve . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog for saving or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard @-@ scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can &apos;t be opened , or if no standard scanners are displayed , a dialog is opened to choose the scanner .
users can select the user to use and press OK to open the scanner . stop off &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to add a picture , the user can only start a Vor@@ sch@@ can and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the pre@@ h@@ can is started by preview button .
to select the picture , the user can zoom in the picture and out from the actual selection . zoom can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview can fit into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if there is a preview of Save a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a window window , shown below . when saving is pressed , then the picture is stored and lie ? en leads to a break and you enter into the main window .
through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview of users . if this preview of users should not wish to be selected , the option must be selected .
this attitude allows them to select how &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores up . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog box in front of each sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically is to store with a generated name in a previously defined file , then you must be able to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where images should be stored without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored according to each scan , this folder will be used as a standard for the saving dialog . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture @-@ fix for the automatic images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets uploaded to a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the # # # string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality for saving image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE On @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and settings can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .

&amp; am@@ arok ; you can set up a list of these pump@@ kins . below , you can set a list of these short@@ cut , click on the Player window and select a global keyboard short@@ cut , click on the Player window to click and select short command button . select button 1 click here .
you may also set up existing multi @-@ buttons so that they operate as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ short commands work . thereby , make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and will describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context brow@@ sers , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function could break &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has a number of own command lines options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use the key dialog , so that the user can not run .
start of the &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ et Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE connections for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; get dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or make it easy to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with amar@@ isk and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should lie every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . mostly the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be easily accessed here . here an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends messages to all of the scripts . in this reason , strings should monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if it does not have any use .
configure We@@ ist the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store and loading data , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ er@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menus . sub@@ menus and it@@ em@@ ap will also be handed over to the selected entry menu . to add a custom entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ res@@ u@@ It@@ em ( subtle menu ) to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; stops or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for instance . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Ex@@ tended amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages straight right .
the main critic must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and put the link to the Viking Script side of &amp; am@@ arok ; for your entry on K@@ DE apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can simply pull music easily into play@@ list , instead you need to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick @-@ search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists will be right for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually you need to enter and install Amar@@ ok &apos;s base folder to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and automatic autom@@ akers , you should have any difficulties when comp@@ ile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ arok ; has like most applications to activate or dis@@ able most of the applications using the configure script or dis@@ able . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirement .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; am@@ arok ; you should use full use .
&amp; am@@ arok ; can be set up without trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cart@@ on cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok ; .
player window will display the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thereby , the color scheme is changed for mood bar@@ ometer .
note : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; am@@ arok ; saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser is required by &amp; am@@ arok ; if a browser is required .
other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not located in the list .
play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; am@@ arok ; . activ@@ ating this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored .
to keep up current pieces at the piece , the play@@ lists window / stops to keep it always in the visible window frame .
when changing the context @-@ browser change automatically the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played .
in the section of the image you can adjust &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can adjust the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ arok ; alternatively , you can select fon@@ ts for the following areas : play@@ lists window , player windows and context brow@@ sers . press on selecting ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
selecting the user @-@ defined colour scheme for yourself , you have the choice of choice and can define an own color scheme . use them to use them for front and background colour .
play at the start , that &amp; am@@ arok ; after program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped at the last place .
the bottom @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to display the switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look directly at the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to choose from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow of shadow causes shadow , that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors use the ability to watch the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for colour selection . if Own colors do not use , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used .
the input field display text represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD , which can be adapted to your needs . below , the O@@ SD can be adapted to their needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama @-@ users . thus , you can define it on which screen of a multi @-@ screen monitor setting the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the audio output audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the radio box . some drivers are able to activate further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the collection card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok ; to refer to music files . to include a folder in the collection with its name , mark the cross@@ box in addition to its name . this section also includes connections to insert , as with the selected folders .
browse these categories as well : this causes it to search for music as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. , or delete files ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search carried out to take the necessary changes to your collection .
import@@ ing the play@@ lists : works that &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup is required in the sub@@ window MySQL setup .
the MySQL @-@ Setup is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the machine enter , it is entered into the database . afterwards , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is achiev@@ able . name : is the database name , to which the connection is manufactured .
use us@@ ername : and password : to insert the data required for the database .
the cart@@ on card ( .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m ) . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
here , enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played tracks and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved in each piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and the gallery with screen shots .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window manager will present the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so , we try to support am@@ aro@@ e on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will be able to make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again .
it is mostly that Tag@@ li@@ b tells about reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler Version . if , for example &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x compiled , then leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace per e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is the fact that many program will write data as UTF @-@ 8 into a met@@ a @-@ info , but these are not described as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; s $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 can always be active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects can be easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . you can keep the status dis@@ able on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a icon until this attitude will show its effect .
if you receive this mistake : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K can see the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ em@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any repe@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K will find the correct version first .
there are some ways to clari@@ fy most of the installation problems by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or using the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a mistake if you have something on the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how come there music pieces now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired file . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to stop the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted into the Statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has been modified with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by users while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate it , you have to display the evaluation list in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column . click anywhere in the new application column in order to set the evaluation for a piece . you can also use short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press the mouse button on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the list of play@@ list .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to play@@ list and let them fall there , just like you &apos;d do it with other files . as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar the play@@ list , right next to the Add button , is the button play@@ list . click on it .
probably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so fairly every single video format . G@@ spre@@ amer may even support text and p@@ ng !
it may be ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied in default no MP3 de@@ or ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , SI@@ AST@@ ET@@ AST@@ E
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ eck@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . this can be achieved by a sound card using hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix @-@ module for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of cause and a solution . you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ essing ) .
this does not do . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t just send a white noise . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them , and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . go directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point in the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper is set to :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause some playback . read this bug report . the enlarge of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA @-@ setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you can not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ spre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to obtain the faster art co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ n _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was highly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ w@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the driver driver , r@@ ushes &amp; am@@ arok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ spre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store ff@@ m@@ peg down , comp@@ ile and install it . then run in the module folder from G@@ w@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the G@@ ST @-@ config file folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute G@@ ST register again . now , start &amp; am@@ arok ; .

thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . place in your calendar program an alarm and let you run with the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok player play
this command leaves &amp; am@@ arok ; playback the playback . make sure that &amp; am@@ arok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be able to pull off the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of bed .
how to get the latest in &amp; am@@ arok ; the current title can be experienced when one is in another computer ?
if a functional SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you perform@@ ers and titles of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ ername am@@ arok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification is available in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA file .

this basically fits the previous evaluation with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less impact has every individual rating on the overall result .
you can apply the evaluation for a piece by clicking on a column inscription on the play@@ list in the play@@ list window . there , you can click on the evaluation of a piece by clicking on the piece and edit : review or F2 . you can also edit your review on the met@@ ad@@ ata dialog .

the queu@@ e @-@ management received your major withdrawal in &amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have more control over the play@@ list , appears in the play@@ list a number next to the title . this number represents the sequence in which &amp; am@@ arok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as a second , and so on .
if you want to add the queu@@ es on the waiting line , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click on + . you can also add the pieces using the mouse or the context menu in the play@@ list . the sequence of the pieces can then change in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to the establishment of this follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your complete collection and adds further random pieces during playing .
add pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( previously : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces in your play@@ list are already . you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic play@@ list .
click on the desired play@@ list , drag it to the play@@ list window or click the right mouse button on you and then choose Store . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old play@@ list so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill your play@@ list and you can add at least one piece even from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added each of your collection . therefore , your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then activate the latest dynamic mode : settings of dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode may also be de@@ activated again .
button New fill the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialog for editing the play@@ list and you can change the respective settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to click on editing . then , the dialog for editing the play@@ list of the play@@ list .
enter here any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continuously grow , and they will not listen to the setting for coming pieces . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under respect of setting recording pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces stored at the beginning of the play@@ list . in this way , you can easily see which tracks were recently played .
this is the number of pieces , which are to be added after each played piece for play@@ list . if you want to grow more than 1 , then the play@@ list is continuously growing , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can cross existing play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ arok ; random pieces from each of the requested play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok ; scripts install by clicking on the script . after installing the script , you can install a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script no longer , you can delete it . click on the script to delete the script .
if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please look at the writing of scripts .
the dialogue window visu@@ aliz@@ ations plug is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok ; used . the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the cross section next to the name .
this fast guide is to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . in order to complete the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other losses of compressed formats , remember that you can get a worse quality when it comes to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss of loss . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialogue window you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this quick instructions will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . in order to complete the steps , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialogue with the possible settings to burn .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button . you can now see a dialogue of the so or something like that :
in this dialogue window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked after an empty CD medium that the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tools U@@ IC can not find the &amp; K@@ DE ; Wid@@ get modules cannot be found . to add this problem , you will add q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search engine for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS by your base folder of &amp; K@@ DE ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is listed under www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org ; you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get rid of the latest news from forums and news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ time mode or DA@@ O ) based on tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; it has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore select &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o is reached ; however , a higher quality when used audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio coding and to use audio data stream . OGG pre@@ bis benefits from open source and is used in direct competitors to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and en@@ coder modules .
mad : here is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . lame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read FLA@@ C files and write .
dra@@ g@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . using FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video revision . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a well @-@ equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video @-@ CDs and Super video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creation of mixing CD &apos;s and Mp3 @-@ Colle@@ ctions ; for example , the different albums of different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that make the music pieces different lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently @-@ opened projects . the accompanying sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
stores the current project . when the project was already saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save will be displayed with which you can choose file and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to store for each single project file .
closes the current project . if a project is changing and not stored , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then break between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing arguments and open the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any stored project which should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each stored project is asked what to happen , as if you were called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the following dialog files to the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project list . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files are published in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Bren@@ nen &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the Medi@@ c dialog only when the project contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can take a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are about what is that ? -@@ help is described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be involved , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn sometime later . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the copy of a DVD . furthermore , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the copy of copying dialog . therefore , the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW drive . thus , you can delete all the content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between writing modes and instructions .
burns a pre @-@ defined CD image . the dialog asks you according to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously used DVD image . the dialog asks you according to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down immediately by pressing the burning button .
a first DVD video can be converted to this dialogue window . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used also standing . it contains information about the certified video , code settings , and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is represented in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small gro@@ ove is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is closed .
if the folder view is a or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media Info , lock and un@@ lock the running work or throw of the media .
if the content view is a or out . the content view allows to choose and pulling files into the projec@@ tors view . the view view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
sh@@ uts the head@@ line in the projec@@ tors view , or from . the head bar is a narrow range which contains only visible projects if the projec@@ tors has open @-@ open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only pretty out and separates the projec@@ tors clearly from the remaining views .
this opens up a dialogue window to modify the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the key order further down below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileg@@ es are required , so you need to enter the password manager for the system administrator ( root ) .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is meant to person@@ alize and for the fine design of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the function range , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task to give you the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then give something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; presents features such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions to create new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the new project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , one can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface that is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is a audio CD ; it &apos;s an audio CD ; it can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the machine installed .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; files located in wav @-@ files on the hard disk ) and of many co@@ den@@ ers , which are to be installed in WAV files ( This Ko@@ di@@ erer packages must still be installed due to the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if it has been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders are already installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to comp@@ ile . but if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which code is supposed to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers provides a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , Audio Quality and Com@@ pressed factors .
a word for copying the audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is not possible to read any audio CD ; it is not possible to use any audio CD ; it is not possible to use a copy of audio CDs ; it is not possible to avoid an audio CD ; not to avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while entries must be made only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , afterwards the daily use of how to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is covered manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step , for example , more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the program .
the CD@@ DB will start on request of the CD@@ DB file , pursuant to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made connection to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the tab card tab , the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the choice with another Encoder can be read when the standard can be read . it is noted that previously the en@@ coder in the tab card configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that a already en@@ coded file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; to read and en@@ code them .
opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming ( such as read the &amp; CD ; ends ) .
opens the main setting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with various maps ( such as en@@ coder , for setting the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG comp@@ etes is available .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as Standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good com@@ ug for music by adolescents , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ facilities . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Insul@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you really want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that will be entered or automatically entered by the free@@ DB file via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / uses with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code to create file names and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with code programs there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt by lame and the title parameter is added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button closure in wi@@ zard ) :
that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download / enter the information up / enter , so that all other information can be downloaded in the hosts . it is too note that all other information is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; for more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company hurt . all information can be obtained at a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; shop , physically , or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is active to choose a cross@@ cross box . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used by the server ( but it can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic will be needed to be used on the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the burden between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Spiegel@@ ser@@ ver@@ n for online invo@@ ices of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what explo@@ it program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more precise , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note is that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for storing the wav files , the co@@ di@@ ers can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first open entries for audio data ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free com@@ pressing for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined code . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a consol@@ ation window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
that can have many causes . check the device code name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and read it and whether the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give advice how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission on it ( eg . by trying to copy them something ) .
the first section treats the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the action to read out a &amp; CD ; what to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the compressed code for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 - 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings any time , we are probably not able to read them in any case of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device code is delivered to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device description of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to create existing entries in the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the maps of General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion is defined . in our example everything will be shown / entered as shown in screen photo .
only if you should ask in@@ complete information , so that you will be informed if data are missing ( tags ) .
the maps CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are convenient and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically automatically via the internet of a free@@ DB file .
note : the machine must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; connected to the internet that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selective field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; associated entry , starts immediately if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily changed . the directory and file name will be changed with con@@ qu@@ icker - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you can use free@@ DB locally in offline mode , if you choose the database before . however , you can choose free@@ DB in the offline mode , at least the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following board map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the information call , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server to the Internet . how does the system know which data is supposed to get the CD ? read the section above free@@ DB . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t want to download the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server near you . on this way , the burden is distributed between the machines . this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work related to the server , but there are many fire@@ walls of the protocol 88@@ 80 standard bo@@ ck@@ les , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one of the same drive on the same drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author does not know , so simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : when you cross this file , the path / folder will be specified in which the wav files are stored on another drive . if the box is not checked , the files will not be checked in a private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files .
all as you type on screen photo is . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something has to be b@@ lown to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo facilities . the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for a very good HiFi stereo system . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the constra@@ int of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is organized in the previous section , is described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD ; we don &apos;t see the screen photos contained a little differently than those for one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will learn the data manually instead of getting rid of them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully collected from the free@@ DB , all tracks are already filled out and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings can be selected manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen , the title of the piece in the first line of the input &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into the &apos; Update &apos; title , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ly per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters in the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the tab card settings ; throw a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the co@@ ders to get more information .
simply select one entry , which obviously agree with the style of the selected CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are available under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there &apos;s a check @-@ sign in front of each row of a piece . just the titles are selected or out . make sure that all pieces are selected or put the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
when clicking on the button choose the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read on the hard drive . the status of the program will appear in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully en@@ coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . the machine used with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is en@@ coded , and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message will appear in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x and 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , are now maintained within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the cr@@ ushing package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package is a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is directed to persons , comp@@ ile by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance , how the program can be adjusted for your needs , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . at best , you can read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different box cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked out after the start @-@ up start of the program , without any reference point out of this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program ) or from the unusual short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , has probably started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot add this manual . it is as the first version to add or change it , may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has mis@@ understood this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others he did not have some properties with real @-@ time graphics and karaoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics to the screen with changing colour so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of activity every MIDI channel by high@@ lighting of the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can draw in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to pull out .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( deck@@ ing events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure .
seat support . if you end &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song , K@@ Mid will start with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and click the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry @-@ play from the menu , or make the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the medium mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and go .
if you find that a song is too fast or slowly played , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the speed display , click on the speed of speed , double @-@ click on the speed page .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or the pick of the menu option in the menu piece , so inter@@ rup@@ ts the play . stress the space while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated that you will not need to set up a song . if you select nothing manually , you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries text events or push events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are played in the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to set a collection , first open the collection managers . you will find in the menu collection below the point . click here to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the bund@@ ling in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be stored . check out if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song in the collection manager . again , you can add a song with the button to select a song , with which help you choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the termination automatic link to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically at the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is enabled , and the collection will continue to be opened . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you will need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played out . if you select the series after the menu of the menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or edit random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the list list on karaoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the button arrow right .
to jump a song back , select the button , select the previous piece from the menu , or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button Clear .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter if it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus can always sound a trumpet when it was originally playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which saves all the necessary conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . pre@@ mise for it is that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Another Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ...
you see that def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , it is specified as the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that supports this instrument , on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , you can do a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a b@@ ump@@ ster . in addition , you bear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , in which each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum means ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds can be shown on a certain channel or instrument :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and any instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form notes on the per@@ col@@ t @-@ channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ note .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange some channels on others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following specimen :
n is the channel , which is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the respective key@@ map must be defined on the front in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , it will always be used patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example , to always use the Per@@ k@@ in patch on the per@@ tin@@ ction channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio are calculated in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be converted to the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is converted and then it will be re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to do so in the map file ( no dec@@ imal numbers ) .
this setting is needed , because GM will make a keyboard , which is to play a sound higher with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards to play up two sounds up to an oc@@ tave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; ch@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find it in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view in the menu settings below the point of channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the temp@@ o , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; ch@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; no AW@@ E support was compiled . to download the problem , you need to download and install a source of sources ( for example , k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic link to the collection before . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can reset the arrow key from the speed page of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o , click the LCD double .
I have on one &amp; K@@ DE ; - Desktop a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and / k@@ mid ; in this way , if I want to play a karaoke file , or I want to play a file only into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; - windows change and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; go .
if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only you want to play the first file . so , set the automatic link to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then , close to B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all the many thanks ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ates that , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ us Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to try to take a bit of time . when Hob@@ bies have programming , MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a huge anticip@@ ation if you send me a postcard from your living location or a Mi@@ di@@ - / karaoke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me , you should contact me as I already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and get rid of no one for money . I therefore want to go ahead , because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - correction of the error , that the pitch was too high with AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magnus pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error noti@@ fying or even a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and karaoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also look at the development and look at links to pages with other karaoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it works as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error correction directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there &apos;s always the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a window window that will be displayed only when information is in it .
it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu button , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archi@@ ved studio . when you submit an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the printed entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed through an editor , but also through the application itself . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this component is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must be selected from the menu with play@@ list and selected either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the edit mode or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change of &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / boot / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be a supported XML file .
the animation during boot does not need to be short , it will automatically end through opening a different source . however , this would be distur@@ bing in the end @-@ animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the advertis@@ ements of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; M@@ bps ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ guards ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MIL they are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here is the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the directive dialog ( K@@ DE ) .
the counter or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages regarding charging the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changes of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play of TV cards either through M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recor@@ ders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player can be used in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be selected from which one needs to be selected ( for example , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux needs to be functioning in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . ) in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . ) .
internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ el , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there tips how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more qui@@ eter , when I play from it ( not from the VCD file : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root as user root after entering the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested for each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interface and network support and is used to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional journal application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it will probably be accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; and &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be attracted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the c@@ ile ; web site .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation is considered . if the support for this project or documentation should be desired , the contact should be made via the c@@ ile ; web site .
if any questions arise or with the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; upon or are desired extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list of c@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and custom@@ ised access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the ability to complete , comp@@ iling and conversion tools for this . conclu@@ sively called , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start with reading the chapter of Work with the Editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right exit is : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH . if it is difficult to use , a la@@ ie ( engl@@ . L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros may use . a less challenging but realistic scale is that it desc@@ ends from the name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
living here is not the ultimate book to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to it . for example , lat@@ ex is not the ultimate book . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

just like other sign languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general properties like paper size , aspect ratio and text box are fixed , as well as a kitchen , with the command \ \ English class , the kitchen will start with the command \ \ \ { document } and needs to be closed with the \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) offers some toll for the creation of the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
document classes : this is what the type of document should be discussed : articles ( article &#93; , book &#91; letter &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; read &#93; &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will use the character encoding . it should be used to use the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . in addition , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the connection it will be balanced only in the cross@@ box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use German texts .
new users are now worried anymore . it is only a brief description of functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides - just like other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , at@@ titudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ matching ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have a simple problem search on the screen , however , it is nevertheless noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and time .
with the automatic verification of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically produces an empty line ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective section .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; once a DVI ; file &#91; framed file size &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the item output from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the socket search , the elements of the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked on an element in the &amp; lat@@ ex file , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding unit is available in the DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used by working with multiple files . with a Master document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick@@ set : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and automatically displayed the result ( if no defect in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode , the DVI ; file is set out on a regular basis . so , there is no access by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast growing .
in case of editing the tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ ms of the selected elements should be developed . the first selection box is designed for the quick installation of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the box field further is available for entries like items such as Tags , fu@@ ties , notes , or references .
name : with this command , a name for a section , image or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection for a selection box ) .
when using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files are also written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the final radio box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¤ e is used for the establishment of the fon@@ ts of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the fu@@ tile marks , etc . there are the following characters to be used for :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection of selection of documentation : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document art and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the bra@@ ckets for the instruction \ \ in the class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . will not be specified at the beginning , it can also happen in the text .
once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the belt or button .
the source code must be stored in front of the compilation . &amp; ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
the compilation of the document failed , should be searched in the protocol after the errors . if using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the fon@@ ts should have a different fon@@ ts . the instruction \ \ hits { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } encour@@ ages the cleaning of the fon@@ ts within the environment .
the inter@@ rup@@ tions are only required within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; to { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no gu@@ ardian ( number ) for the possibility of inf@@ ill within a environment .
there are many ways to mention the sense of reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands may either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ \ { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ rant pressure and is available as long as long as he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ \ { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex source code , a step @-@ for @-@ step guide is now followed for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wi@@ zard , a bit text was entered , a few adjust@@ ments should be accomplished for better read@@ ability of the document . here , mind@@ . a quote , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem for use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l has to be turned down again to the editor ( at an external viewer ) , the window must be closed down .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into one &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file is converted . easy to try and enjoy .
DVI ; is a large file format file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ ylon ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - by clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed correctly ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar creates the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion to different formats can start in the tool@@ bar .
the advance search is the direct jump from the editor to the respon@@ sive position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; ile ; provides a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . you only need to set Modern under settings c@@ ile ... tools are well balanced .
in order to search for the preliminary review , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source text and close to fore@@ sight . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer is then done so .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and to the corresponding line . it has to set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( Settings ... editor )
if using quick @-@ construction of &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t be open , you can make a mistake . if a mistake should lie , this will appear in the log@@ ging file or in the news window .
the log@@ ging file describes the source code in the source code . in the editor you can always be used on the error , in which the error appears . to consider the f@@ law@@ ed line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the f@@ law@@ ed line .
once attached to the corresponding kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , a window to select the document is published . the default setting is :
with a selection of empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written or the assistant to quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates are in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file open or creates a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template .
when creating a new document using a new document , some character strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables will set up settings on the settings ... settings must be set .
by creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be used as such as : \ \ in class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to creating a template is the use of the wi@@ zard and the resulting entries in the editor . once the document has been created , you will complete the following steps :
when creating a new document , the own template may be exposed instead of standard sizes .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn more about Kate ; and his mom should be attracted the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be used directly with reading the chapter of Work with the Editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command refer@@ ential , which can be called for the volume of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may reveal a selection of virtually all commands that can find in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click on the C@@ tr@@ l button to expand the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , clicking \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is merely \ \ par excellence .
when pulling the text with covered lin@@ ker mouse , the balanced text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , the source text of the source texts will be exposed in the Edi@@ tor@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the range of sources of sources and produce them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants like this trampoline . these are a number of book@@ marks within the text , or the relevant key checks of the leap to n@@ ett@@ est or last dive sign . this jump brand is highlighted as well , so that it will automatically be credited with the first input of a character .
the processor is likely to use one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding care products have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for their selection . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under adap@@ tations , the following commands are included in the text code :
however , a complete paragraph ( group of lines which included on both sides is an empty line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with transparent lines , and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source tex@@ tures . the only prevents thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the cancellation is separated by two empty lines .
if the word consists of the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a large number ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
the button of a part of the document can be removed first and removed by wires of the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key ¼ r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with its own commands . under processing , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of adap@@ tations .
it has already been noted that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders in processing environment for a m@@ ingly simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly from the command to the rest of the surrounding area .
this command is inj@@ ected by the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor before or inside the command \ \ &apos; begin with the environment , it is inj@@ ected to the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering the surrounding area of w@@ asted ambient commands a quick view can be lost quickly . this command stops the latest environment , so that the end of the end of the surrounding area is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the hidden cl@@ amp .
this command is inj@@ ected by the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the peeled cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the peeled bra@@ ckets of a &amp; tex ; group # is , is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many stock@@ pil@@ ed groups bra@@ ckets you can lose a quick view . this command stops the most important group so that the fusion structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple test marks are used as quality mark . for the purpose @-@ purpose implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is &quot; used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close instruc@@ tional sign for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic plug @-@ in for double text can be set up under settings c@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be eliminated .
it can also be used to specific settings ( e.g. , or French ) and in order to be used in German or French . there are also many other languages available .
in the back of Shift ; ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E is suitable &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position inside a lists area ( e.g. breaks or it@@ em@@ ize ) is , for example &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close within a tables -@@ area close t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with a close @-@ up line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users found the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to be encouraged . although this tab is not the door , for &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns is added to the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code that offers , it has been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to demand and the other two are for the automatic translation . all these mo@@ di can set up for different work@@ ings on settings c@@ ile ... fully set .
at the start of a new environment by command \ \ , { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { ambient } according to an empty line ( for the text ) .
at the end of the button , the final letter of the input will be removed and , but it is possible that the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter , on the other hand .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be found , so that a simply leap to these positions can be found , and the following parameters will be enclosed .
settings are c@@ ile ; set up ... c@@ ile ; fully custom@@ ary settings to these lists . there are different was@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as che@@ ers of the common language used .
the command mode is not valid for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ in order to be entered and the setting of complete mode is used . on the other hand , the environments are often used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the complete edit menu , or the button on Alt + Change button , the command will be automatically open and it appears in \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature is continued on a sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by wires of input bar .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command will be used .
settings are c@@ ile ; set up ... c@@ ile ; fully custom@@ ary settings to these lists . this mode uses the activation list of the displacement mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; ile ; under@@ line custom lists of custom strings , which are instantly replaced by l@@ apping character strings . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , for example , the letter L entered and the word read @-@ in mode , the letter L + Alt empty button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
generally speaking , you are not helpful for the automatic translation . however , it has been noted that many cases are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the full @-@ term for all is already written .
this mode can set up c@@ ile settings in the menu . here , the corpor@@ al value can be set off . here , the corpor@@ al value for the display of the displacement can be specified .

the dialogue graph@@ s designed the entries of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basic principles for the graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for the other types and orders of pages . the PDF output files are arranged , so you can re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to examine the outcome of the work , you must use the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu creation , creating converting and creating view .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can &apos;t be done with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you may not wait to benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found below .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug@@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialogue enables to manage all plug@@ ins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can type the search path . add plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching plug@@ ins .
often work on one project several people in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties @-@ Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user name of user and serves to identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who it is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( your identification ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nickname and attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of your team there is another advantage by the capture of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team manager if something specific happens . see in further information .
event promotions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . a example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so much anyone has worked , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script which plays a file into CV@@ S when it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list on the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see where the ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes option is simple . it can either select either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by note text .
comments can be sent to a potential member of the team . in this case , the nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project Manager . the appropriate enrich@@ ment or sub@@ project names should be led , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roles names are independent of big or small @-@ en@@ roll@@ ment , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : do the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ ant@@ a ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car complet@@ es can be changed thereby . entries are :
large / small en@@ roll@@ ment of tags : big / small en@@ roll@@ ment of automatically added tags . normal big / small en@@ roll@@ ment means that tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small en@@ roll@@ ment of attributes added : big / small en@@ roll@@ ment of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / small registration means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if desired , it is optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this is immediately added to the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags , except for the simple tags .
automatically update starting and end @-@ day : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic acc@@ ent of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the appropriate coding during inser@@ ting .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ eti@@ tes to identify different types of files . using the default setting , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way as a file opening of opening files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting is executed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files , whose DT@@ D is not recognized . but this setting is executed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for even stored documents , backup is regularly updated , according to the set time created .
the preview and documentation can be shown either in the edit area or own view ( or documentation in a box leader ) which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through through the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depends on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ line parameters .
the warning messages range is used to control the possibility of war@@ nings by anch@@ oring no longer .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view can be specified in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the Struc@@ ture @-@ click on the structure tree , it is possible to change through the structure of the structure with the mouse button .
in the area structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the up@@ dating of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened , empty groups are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in which the current document was found .
the area for determining the short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) , which can be folded to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s , this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause is slightly different than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here , the plug@@ ins can be administr@@ ated . plug @-@ ins are a third page , which can be re @-@ used by every K@@ part @-@ enabled application , the best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in insert a plug @-@ ins must be stated :
address : the path to plug@@ in unless there is not at a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
entry : this information is delivered to the plug@@ in , so it can open up the current file , the corresponding file ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse to store when this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct , then , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely re@@ designed . di@@ eting support for the not necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set up , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations on plug@@ ins .
at present , only a plug@@ in is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plug@@ in with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is not necessary .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . includes connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to enter a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and the current line is constantly going on . if this is done while the script is continued , the execution will be continued , the script will start with the requirement .
displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information to secure variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script has been stopped , the execution is going on , the execution will begin once a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , whereby when possible in functions and includes in@@ cor@@ rupted .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the directive and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the above @-@ a@@ woke value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ ity view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car responsibilities and scripts . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the brand @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script language or &amp; CSS ; S &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool bar . tag folder contain two file types , the text and instructions qu@@ icker into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details for conversion .
this document describes how to create XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , an &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bar provide a quick insert of tags in a document without a risk of a man .
tag folder are nothing but folder . you only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible to make other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything related to the possibilities and limits .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a mere element type , otherwise nothing else .
type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
sets a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Tag . that is a only element of element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only be found only for each attribute . additionally , there is additional tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source codes for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and the attribute tree in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a methodology . the arguments that are handed to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container that is group@@ ed together with the elements of a list . it can only occur for attribute description . it is a only element of element .
speci@@ fies the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; app@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this item is a single element type .
there is a list of elements that end one day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; Declaration start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces this , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , check only when loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this day XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 version = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; for one of a list selectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = revers@@ al 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
a action can set up with settings actions ... clicking on New Action leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion is allocated to this promotion . with clicking the user button , a key abbrevi@@ ation can be assigned ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ective settings and in execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can be started or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick release dialog , or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ D .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ ame / scripts / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the listed methods , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input , the default input can be determined , which can send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the document &apos;s selected range is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
accordingly , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal edition , on the default file . it can be specified , which should be done on the default text file , by setting the value the selected edition is set to :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to under@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes and you plan their use , enable you to edit dialogue &quot; tag &quot; when available , so that an input when using this action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly icon . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? if we replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ins@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics Other programs ( or where else it is in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ins@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ;
in regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ ck , further interpre@@ t ) , or should at least , a message to the user , click this symbol a &amp; lt ; start@@ ling ; -@@ tag in current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and put them on with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar , or it should set this for better overview through some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool bar set up dialog on Settings tool bar . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or could be the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool bar must be tested by sending all symbols to ensure that everything works .
ass@@ ure you in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( will be ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the form language that you like to like . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ os@@ itory whether any one has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you &apos;ll need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you to the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ one , relatively to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = listing 1.@@ html Section 2 = Report 1.@@ html Section 2 = Report 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = Report 1.@@ html - day 2 = tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html .
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = basic syntax = basic syntax .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that there are sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess tables ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the scope of content is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended to display the context of an context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( content List ) and file binding .
a simple list of separate context elements that are supposed to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to be involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the her@@ ni@@ ated resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send an email to friends , partners , or else to whom are sent . in different places , there is an email address , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download it and only made available if our team needs them as correct and us@@ fully for publication , for what it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources are assured , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked by their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have to pass a number of keys . in the dialog New resource needs to remain blank ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK .
upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , the tool@@ bar will instantly upload , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the configuration of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format . it gives the simpler way to convert DT@@ D automatically to a DT@@ D package .
conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ fication : the string that appears in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will be released
fine setting of the DT@@ EP after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; according to converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; adapted to the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these fundamental concepts and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first create these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; available , available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators differently factory devices , actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements constitute a personal collection of web development products for a single user . these are user specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ Mu@@ ch up to tool@@ bars , especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are placed in the folder &apos;s tree , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ing window , the building grounds , the boxes with information and the tool bar . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas .
one can click the cart@@ ons with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , re@@ loading , delete , or upload document , jump or upload of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or type of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right now in the editing area , lead to a further context menu on the selected document content , such as basic machining steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing under the mouse pointing tags or opening the file , if the string is described under the mouse command file .
at the top end of the editor of the editor , the tool@@ bar of the editor are present . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new features and thus adapted user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the data to enter this straight day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the construction managers ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and go through . in the display with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation designs .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , upload , or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programming , whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities for you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context it will be used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of the layout in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can send the available information to a script . the right mouse button are available , such as the script , edit , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an elementary document the cur@@ sor will be placed on the position of the element . by right click , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this allows changing the content of all available attributes with a few mouse cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , can be achieved via the usable information : the news window and the problem windows .
this cart@@ on display shows information about each running in Qu@@ ant@@ a script . for example , the DT@@ D used the current document and all modifications to the DT@@ D .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the check of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as it gives ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . showing on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command . the manual page of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they get a tool bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other back and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with Star@@ ts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be to deal with an obvious , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now even far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us should be ; therefore , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us should be .
well , to the above requirement must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is based . thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this allows automation almost any task possible . thanks to the program com@@ ets , they &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us may expand . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and has been quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of this documentary is with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; input , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you open . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . check in the section above templates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ ference folder , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ eme that it is correctly displayed and not understood by the browser as formations .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ eme that the correct method for inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors day .
switch the block selection and out . it allows you to select text blocks using the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
is looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed using GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ gers .
training and in@@ ti@@ cking of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the problem is enabled , once you are changing to the structure tree .
shows the symbol left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if you are reading book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu groups after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have further inputs / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find details .
invites a project tool bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialogue to add a new tool bar . this creates only the names . actions need to be stored on by settings actions , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar , whether you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the visible area . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
therefore , you can send their own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , thus the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the upload of tool bar on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or any other has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description .

this menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently charged tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool bar .

this should not be implemented according to the environment of the mouse model , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project , e.g. after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when you enter the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote computer setting , adap@@ tion could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default template . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder , where the tool bar for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and change it . if you want to download and change your script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go different .
if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be bound . if a project of the reason is to be re@@ opened , do not arrive .
using this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can take a precise choice of credits .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the ha@@ k@@ ite , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project Properties properties in the class@@ room profiles or changed with the key shift shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re @-@ read with project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is invited to open the project , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to choose the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plu@@ gin can be set with the button options . in this case , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted as well as the display of a supervision for the content of the server for each profile , by po@@ ise your own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can change event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a certain event happens , such as the backing of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project , open the tool@@ bar . the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project supervision provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file behave as well , however , the entries are opening and open with ... in the context of the right click menu ( click menu ) :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information on the place of uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing the removal .
the password is stored in the core memory and forget about programming . this possibility is useful if you need to save files necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password on the disk should not be found in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion from the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile will display this dialog :
this is the server &apos;s name to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate so it can &apos;t be read , but everyone with programming languages can be easily seen in the clear text .
a project view is only a set files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project with many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool bar , re@@ mot@@ ely stored on the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most of them . this helps not only increase productivity , but allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to their own working mode .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best about the menu tool bar is st@@ aging . use and adding . add the tool bar will be treated below in the section adding of tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and symbols can be set out either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be implemented with New Action , a new tool bar code or tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog box , where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will remove and action worked that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the Tool@@ bar and the actions in them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings ... and setting out actions ..
templates are linked to the essential document skel@@ eton , code cuts and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any standard file system connected to the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted every file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in stock room under global templates . more information about the Templ@@ ates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . it makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in storage room under global templates . see in for more information on templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted in documents , but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl . some examples include the storage room under global templates . see in for more information on templates tree .
as the name tells you serve these templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar Archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File as template as local template .
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the stock room under project templates .
select text in your document and click the file as a template . alternatively , select the selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with pulling and disman@@ tle to the Bau@@ man@@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only reads into a pre @-@ level folder . it can be used in file management functions such as pulling and disman@@ tle or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder right click and secure Site template , secured a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved as a local or global template .
project pen@@ cils enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ line and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; shape , add files or link with them . additionally , you can retain some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to determine the behavior of a folder in the pre @-@ check table with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu , the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , as soon as El@@ ter@@ istics attribute has b@@ lown off .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders . if a regular folder would be set up , unless it would be explic@@ it activated . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you can probably appear in a regular folder .
allows you or review the text for templates in this folder . this could be general head @-@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows you to fit into a folder with special head@@ line / foot@@ er a presentation of the matching head@@ line / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you can also add context menu ( click on that , right mouse button ) to add a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be re@@ achable via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code in two parts : the source code Editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL panel works as follows : it charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back when needed to the source code , in which the source code is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that includes the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ens@@ ein of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode is just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously run . with pres@@ sures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the keyboard pressure the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , whereby the position is preserved in the document .
the synchron@@ icity between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code is set adjustable via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a .... View may be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically select . in general , the recommendation can be set in addition . in principle , the recommendation is applicable for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow computer .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the title of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows the reduction of the h@@ ensive body . therefore , you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. impact words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click in the list allows the modification of the inscription , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content @-@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages on your browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is possible just like the met@@ a @-@ elements . the edit of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to attach a external CSS style file by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sors &apos;s use is as in a word processor , possible due to arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and using button or re@@ mo@@ red .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ bars , such as the source code , such as the existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the listen assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used to use the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style deposits . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ ts , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the Stil@@ ts can be followed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; you need to comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml existing at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available .

there are many graphical tools to the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes , and at the same time corrected the entry . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed in this section . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the reg@@ ression has changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters . later any amount of other useful functions were added later .
if you want to compare the text quickly , then copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ run file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people can work independently in one piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps the resolutions of conflicts and shows the result of the expected outcome . in this editor you can even edit the results directly . in this editor you can even edit the results directly . the screenshot picture shows three qu@@ ell files at merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you in the same and mer@@ run complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and operate the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check Ko@@ de frequently , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown clearly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it on a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger , if nobody changes the deposit . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then shows the color which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the typ@@ ing work by using only the file name from the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 file folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 3 @-@ o target ord@@ ner
the opening dialog allows manual entry from the file names , select the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the list . open your selection and shows it again next time . if you don &apos;t have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is carried out .
over the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ ing or merge of folders will be selected , for B and C , but then use a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file names from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging merge is active , the input field is active for the target and can process itself . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can do this step later when storing .
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ ing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in opening dialogue you don &apos;t need to select files , you can close the dialog simply with the break button .
you can also use pulling and drag : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how these functions are , it would only be to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and now you can simply copy the relevant sections , add , and then compare .
note : at the moment , you can &apos;t get out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the text of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the pulling and put text into another program as cut@@ ters and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse block a while over the line . then a small aid window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a color blue , B is the color of green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , you see the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
left next to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . in some programming languages , where white signs will not be so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , divi@@ des the summary column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is displayed onto broken lines .
the results window ( under the comparison list ) also has a Info @-@ line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; Ge@@ change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , save is dis@@ able ! ! ! ( use the buttons to jump to next sol@@ der@@ est conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference simultaneously has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group of the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then be highlighted by the beginning of the group . ) This group will then highlighted the current group with the color background colour to the current section , and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , however , no further line remains left in the group ; it &apos;s only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you can change your opinion and perhaps again another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and add somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ies ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the sources choose the options to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the image speed and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . you can also click navig@@ ates to the vertical picture line .
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insert @-@ button you can change between inser@@ ts and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left @-@ left mouse button is synchron@@ ized into one of all windows looking at the beginning of the respective group ( as already stated in the section and the edi@@ table window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image upward / Str@@ g picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all not automatically deleted conflicts after the manual . therefore , one needs to be differenti@@ ated between sol@@ dered and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the markings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy kno@@ b ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is activated , it will be automatically rep@@ uted into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copy expi@@ res . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally cover the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored in accordance with the basic operating system \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ out range \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ out of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of files used will be automatically stored and restored in the next startup . ( menu adju@@ sting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a typ@@ ef@@ ace with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides writings with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are shown in itali@@ c writings . if the scrip@@ ture is not supported , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered illustrated . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically displays an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
if you push your input or return , the entry of the previous line is automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy is then dischar@@ ged into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which type of line type you prefer to store . default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
in the same files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging will not ignore white signs .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a chari@@ ot mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then could be put files with different sizes in side @-@ to @-@ side comparison identical , however , like a white sign , but if this option is activated , this option must be disabled . if this option is activated , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ res the differences nevertheless , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
inten@@ sively searching for smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly in very large files .
in automatic @-@ step mode , this adjustment determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ disputed conflict will continue .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful if you need to have time in many files less important . if you are only about time to use conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning by folders and through a merge . see details below documentation to the directory @-@ comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already one such backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option is not the current program . you need to finish and restart the program . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is published globally on the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries are used for the top setting .
for encoding the coding settings for the coding is a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this does not affect how special characters are treated and interpreted as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , can be compared and merged with different coding files .
if you have processed a file , you can define what code to store will be used .
if you define supply commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can only cope with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the issue of processing command .
switch this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed in addition to the normal still another transition column with the necessary information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just run the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window next to each other or over each other . this may also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click will start merge and use the file name of the last source file as a default name for output files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which allows you to cut off @-@ cut parts or for correct the deposit .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is indicated ( see above ) , the output of command is only used by the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly corresponding to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users would not want to program this . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This is an erg@@ ent expression on each string and this connection refers to the found text in the first cl@@ amp . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems are used to include a number of keywords : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you have experim@@ ented with sed experiments , you may be able to understand it and maybe you might like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command line for line spac@@ e. sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every match between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ gens are different from per@@ l some details . where , \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and to merge . further operations are only changing the data , which sees the line @-@ off Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor is the issue of normal Pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice any specific differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to process many files in a file . for this reason you can compare and merge complete folder .
... makes a proposal to merge a proposal ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes , without them really perform ,
... includes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 keys ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 used as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to merge the merge . to select the merge , you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during reading the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
every file and every file that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the right or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions of all sub@@ directories , and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folder .
if you click on a file , the file comparison will be launched and there is a comparison window .
the icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge action is started , you will be informed about the problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as identical when its overall content is identical . then , folders have the same color . for folders , the age is un@@ parall@@ eled for his colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow , and later , when it is old , red is red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. A folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize mode , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder were specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ize with directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging ( copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge and then select the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date will be different , but the date is identical .. While such mistakes are not removed , the file will not be started .
while mer@@ ging will be a file after the other . you status column indicates that when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages , when something unexpected is completed , you should check out a final review and see if the status is ok everywhere .
if set up in setting dialog , the file @-@ like method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of de@@ o@@ yster , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either lead the just selected entry ( file or os@@ cen@@ aries ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merge .
please note : if you have no target file specified , then in the Three @-@ file association mode , C is used as a target , when two @-@ folders will be selected as a target and syn@@ cing a B and / or B as a target .
if you have chosen a target file , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in folder structure . check out these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key abbrevi@@ ation ) . to execute only the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to contra@@ dic@@ tory data types , there are still inv@@ alid lines , a message appears on the f@@ law@@ less elements . you can then select a valid action .
when you meet all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and break .
select Sim@@ ul@@ ating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( perform a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( see screen photo ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select another directory , or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were set individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not meet them together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files located on the specified pattern will appear in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden point . in other file systems marked a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links are displayed . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are switched off . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( please note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not appear on possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is switched off to an end @-@ release . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ der , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower if it is applied to files , which contain no text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder on a slow network , it may be faster , only the changing date and the file size . this speed advantage costs you to be sure . please use caution . this option is activated in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of changing date . there is no real comparison instead . these files are regarded as identical when when copying the date of lost lost . please use caution . this option is activated in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode , if two folders are compared and no target folder is indicated . in this mode , the proposals will be identical to the merge . the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
in case there are differences , it is proposed to merge the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , for it is assumed that the other file is not changed too . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ .@@ If a old backup file will be deleted with the .@@ original extension , this also affects the normal merge file , not only the mer@@ ging whole folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the file summar@@ ies will remain visible by the merge of single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want you to switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window divi@@ der window in the window menu , switch between the two views and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file via double click . nevertheless , there is a single file also directly related to the file . once you save the file , the status will be settled directly and the file will not be reset , and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder .
however , this status is lost , however , when you read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : new reading
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things should be aware of :
a path can be relatively short and .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or a file . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( ft@@ p : , FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . hence soft the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( please note the option of confidenti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files , if it is used as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then , start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch program is to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it does not work if not the original file exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . merge or the compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in the part mode .

I use GP@@ L programs already very long and I &apos;ve learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone this way or let him go .
you probably have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not have the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . you can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line will be treated as identical . i@@ F similar lines at next to Each other , this mean is because this is is often the case .
the Editor refers to any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost , however , when the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra file format , which could store this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly , No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information , how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes will be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is available in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and automatic machine used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ ile . however , problems arise , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switching ) ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching @-@ insert ) add text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders aren &apos;t appear in the folder structure , and consequently , not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function updates . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated that identical files will not be copied to the target file . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is likely to change in a later program version ) . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source using the Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already existing , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature look of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas to end their size to end or move it . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work areas as well as in the current applications . applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and other .
the medium mouse button windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible , both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu will depend on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if it has been cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; but if it has been cli@@ cked on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application , and the entries to minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and be@@ ating . the commands have the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this cross@@ box is marked , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work areas are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work areas . it is provided together with name , the names with ordin@@ ance numbers are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs will appear as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work areas will appear to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is determined : classic lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid appear , as from p@@ ager applications in some other windows managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work areas in a horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing side at the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager @-@ mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that he can display in size , view the windows as symbols or with their content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and to set up the switch from the switch ... letting the dialog appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialogue settings . but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t want to register as a user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you have to register the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and to as@@ sign a value . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic package .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screenshot of screen . you can use with &amp; k@@ gs ; you can use a magni@@ fier for different users . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a vision . this documentation should be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag ; .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you don &apos;t like , start a window like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of screen . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of screen and is referred to as a select window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse models like a mov@@ able lu@@ e . alternatively , you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; in addition , you can initi@@ ate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( eg . window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse model on the screen ( eg ; on the left ) .
would you like to avoid the mouse pointing out in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse pointing out . please note that it &apos;s not able to recognize the form of the mouse model . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse pointing .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the select window to your own needs . you can shift it with arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fying window , and hold the left mouse key , so you can capture the content of the magni@@ fier tube and move . this also goes with arrows keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can post@@ p@@ one the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the select window . note that the top @-@ left corner of the box office remains , and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ like ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into a file , turn into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the up@@ dating of the display . the stop for this up@@ dating shows that the needed CPU time is set to 0 .
select the up@@ dating rate ( very low , low , medium , high altitude , very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your introduced short command to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ rades ( with the button document again load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and reduction &amp; etc ; .
can also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; this is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research ch@@ eur or artists to the web designer or vision handi@@ cap .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate people at the re@@ peti@@ tive strain inc@@ eption ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and which each mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the drag with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain when clicking on the mouse and helps to use so many people trying to use the computer without pain . if you suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to avoid it even again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain , which arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by pressing the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be compens@@ ated for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the motion .
if the intelligent shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after removing the mouse button . move it to the end of the movement , before the release of the mouse button is run . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise , but you get used fast .
after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool has to run out a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ fel@@ icity is switched on , the shooting time is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is waiting again , when there is no mouse button to get rid of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now is activated by clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; go to sound and multimedia . go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider General . there is a slide @-@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you set up at a lower value to reduce the response time .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please find out the respective documentation to determine how you automatically start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values that were set at the opening of the dialog . have you already pressed the button on the user , the settings are reset to the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , use the smart gri@@ t . in particular , if you have to get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response time of &amp; K@@ DE ; at speeds .
first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to un@@ wanted reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ ck , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear quickly if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have the ball away , you would have to see the roles . these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the contamination can easily wi@@ pe off with a flat blade or finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system doesn &apos;t inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can no longer end through the release of the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can re@@ work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and put the cur@@ sor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you &apos;re looking for a keyboard cli@@ cks . safe zones for the mouse models are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent reading , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move again to any other action . however , it will likely cause them to cause some problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart phone if you just start making &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . check the text instead of a mouse click on the end of the text area , while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when it comes to intelligent shifting the shooting time . later you can use the intelligent shifting without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be used , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . that should be the case on most of the system .
the function of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers , and are set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is actu@@ ated shortly after the mouse pointing out . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I Syndrome and which is the suffering of the bri@@ dging pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is let go . in this way , the pulling and dis@@ closure can also be performed with the mouse .

the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is superior and contains essentially an input field for ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ uting of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you &apos;re k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the sets that you want to hear . each spoken is attached to the default memory . you can select from these sets that are to be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings Sc@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cart@@ on cards , voice output and at@@ titudes , page Wor@@ ds and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of voice output , give the command to the command of the voice field . in the box office below the input field , you specify the drawing code , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; he has two types to pass the lyrics . select the text box if the text will remain unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the box is not selected , the text will be continued as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command is based on your language generator . this command will find you in the documentation to your language generator . examples are found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
with possi@@ ble@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , use &amp; k@@ mouth ; the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications is further developed on this page , which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text box or in the box for text box books .
with the selection of so@@ da , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted in the default memory . selected the selected text passage in the input field only entered into the input field .
using the second selection box , you can define if the textbook book should be automatically stored when switching the editing window .
the book will be saved with the selection of textbook book@@ store . if you are going to dis@@ card changes , the textbook will not be saved . if you have any changes , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text box is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ bin@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ship . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth , a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this list box , you can select the currently used dictionary for the response .
with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export it into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
in this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is determined by paragraph of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be stopped .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ issued words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main part of the window for processing text box is divided into two . in the upper part , the text box are represented as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key book . if you select a textbook book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the order of text keys or text passages can change by pulling with the mouse to the new spot or with arrows keys and &amp; Alt ; -@@ button change .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text section , this is used otherwise the selected areas of the expi@@ ration .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text section , this is used otherwise the selected areas of the expi@@ ration .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the expi@@ ration .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifting factory @-@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands are displayed . by default , the tool bar is displayed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left hand side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another point .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main board with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hat@@ ched .
if this menu entry is crossed , it will be displayed with entries in the box office directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the narrow@@ ed left side and pulling , the tool bar can be moved to another point .
probably you have the command for voice output not right or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see entries for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a lingu@@ istic edition system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are currently supported . the license allows you to use Festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a built @-@ in language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free to use and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the speech output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option is to be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ y , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax enjoys the last sign of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ st / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on as default entry .
the language edition dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further voice service , all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various speech output systems .
because the voice of the language is only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use a possible rat@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setting you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on individual computers and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak text by the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved as a list of pro@@ verb@@ s pro@@ positions which can always be re @-@ spending the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a type of existing service , which allows each application to read text on the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a partial system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications using the T@@ TS capabilities . users also offers interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; also when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications embedded .
the speech output is performed via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ;
allows the creation of language spending on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
in the future : support for speech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ up @-@ met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the Language Edition Service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without the visible window , the T@@ TS services above &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configuration and configuration of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the K@@ DE Acc@@ essibility Mail@@ ing list . you can also find the list on htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility . you can also find the developers at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need to install speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the board map speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who can differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speakers .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ mounted speakers in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map card is displayed . this will then automatically start when you run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all already furnished speaker will appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application gives no speaker .
select one speaker @-@ click on the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select one speaker @-@ click on the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker @-@ click on the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of the speaker in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls to choose from .
if you click here , click on the new spokes@@ man on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the card card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is checked by &amp; K@@ DE ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; please click on the map card orders to create text orders and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language pro@@ pul@@ sion system of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the cart@@ on card in general to open this cart@@ on card . here you can set some general options .
mark this cross@@ box in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text files and read it . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system of &amp; K@@ DE is de@@ activated .
when it is finished , it will run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field of speech is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked .
if this passage is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can restart text files , stop , stop and record .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; reading position or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
on user or OK , click on all the changed settings on all sides .
the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the Create button in general and cross speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run , and select the text menu tools . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text before . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . mark the text which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you will notify you of your fixed events . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can set up various types of news . you can set &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , you can be noti@@ fied when in an IR@@ C channel you can find a message in which your nickname . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filters for the distribution of character provide a good way to correct and correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for regular work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tration , text will be edited , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation to select wrong words or short@@ cuts or to select certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working mode of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern Edition has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of screen readers will be read , the contracts are resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone is welcome that just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text entries . each order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text applications . text files are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular drum@@ ming .
all four order species are working in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . if a application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such reads , this output will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text files as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages .
filter editing the text and give it to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text , which allows you to specify either as words or a regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string sub@@ du@@ cks , which enable the replacing of chat @-@ emotions like : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding shape .
&amp; XML ; Modification use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format into another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; there are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send to a speaker . if you have set a female voice in an example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filter has an adjustable rules according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter decides that its rules does not apply , the text will remain unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or one &amp; K@@ DE ; mail to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent out , it will be mach@@ ined by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . the processing is carried out in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be moved from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters , and it will be displayed on the following entries di@@ alogs .
for the installation of character fill@@ ers you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns will be exchanged in text , then the text will be exchanged with the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ stroke will not be considered when compared .
specify a name for your filter . this name may be arbitr@@ arily chosen , it must only distinguish from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is displayed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , store the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks a list of languages here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when clicking on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately through comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can only use the application q@@ d@@ bus with the q@@ d@@ bus program . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , you need to copy the user name . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be displayed .
if all conditions are applied to the text box filter , the filter is applied only if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to other words , the default setting filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must thus be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you can find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; K@@ DE ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions then you can use it in di@@ alogs and edit these expressions . the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; custom@@ ary &amp; # 160 ; phr@@ ases in the big@@ u@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former trans@@ former &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transi@@ tions . but it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough .
you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filters are looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker features that the program gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the properties of the speaker , subject to speaker , send the chosen speaker .
if the filter is used here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the incorporated regular expression . is on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions are installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , place the characteristics of your desired speaker . if the text meets the above shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements at the beginning . click on the button to indicate the dialogue selection .
use these buttons to store or delete all settings , or delete all the settings .
the speaker optional filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions are applied to a box in the box . you must apply at least one condition .
the speech output API , of &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ bus ; interface of the language API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program of kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
the text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will give .
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ Filter was set up , but in use of the module for the festival websites do not read pages .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able is not working at all . you will also have to do this voice to read on the web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ section characters seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that all sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . is there problems with certain characters or words , may this possibly be solved by a string @-@ pin filter . see .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license you &apos;ll find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ g under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / .

KT@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information that are not included in this manual .
the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , set yourself in conjunction with the Develop@@ er team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the developing files for the programme &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source lyrics of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you have to download or install the tar@@ ball for each night , translate , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ript SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is used to use the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ ach@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the device of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is not needed anymore .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . users can go back or retri@@ eve the user , repeat the output or break off .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it may be used to request a female english speaker for the output . if you want a speaker , this is used , otherwise , if you want to learn a female english speaker , otherwise , if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose one speaker , see you in .
if you click on the map speaker , click Add , and click on editing the list or click on editing , the module card is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details about modules can be found .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . in general , this setting will be made automatically . generally , western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , e@@ ast@@ erly languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slides , you can adjust volume , talk @-@ speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t choose a number of controllers , it will not be displayed by you chosen voice this settings .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be charged with several seconds because of their size . if you are called this cross@@ box , these voices will already be loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger storage consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this crash field cannot be selected , you have not yet been set up any speaker ( or forget to use it ) . see .
if this passage is marked , at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window is visible , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . click on the system section to display the program window .
if this passage is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to keep reading or to control others .
here are all orders in the queu@@ e listed , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight @-@ worked proposition . the speaker ID is the column ID on the card actor .
with the buttons in this series you can select a wh@@ om@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also on the other box cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will shr@@ ink the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .

only text entries are listed and administr@@ ated . editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , it can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ TB ; % is about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the SO@@ X program needs to be installed .
to use the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops system , click on users .
the list of AL@@ SA devices include all PCM devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , select a standard .
on this map card you can set up special actions which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processed four types of language contracts :
the Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern Edition has the highest priority . it will advance all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of screen @-@ readers has been read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web site , you can ride with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone will welcome you who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output in the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the introduc@@ tory news .
the settings on this box card apply only for normal text messages . for messages , war@@ nings and the editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .

if this setting is marked , messages will be played , where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog box , which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ res .
use this radio box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event takes place . you have the following selection options :
if you wish to read custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed on the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for certain event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , action will be implemented for all other events in certain application . as the last option , action is used to carry out the standard ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the use standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the noti@@ fications as follows :
use button Save to store the settings for the messages to a file . the invited events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Clear . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark the text for a voice output . this standard includes brands for control of voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of an example . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , using the SS@@ ML edition .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start text in individual sentences , as only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not all the text order . thus , you can also stop or break down the card card , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not directly supported .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be set up automatically as submission to a pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . you can change its settings or add more pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition filter , but beg@@ inner is de@@ pressed .
in the easiest way , learn the setup of speaking selection by selecting . switch off the text selection , and select some features and check out how the selection of the speaker has changed . you must naturally have more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then apply text files on the map card orders or ab@@ ort , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition filter is automatically set up if you run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . it can &apos;t be switched off , just removed . change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .
compare the text with a regular expression of Satan and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ mark ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the stat@@ ute limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard stat@@ eless @-@ recognition filter is re@@ tains the character .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( regular ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal shift @-@ recognition filter , you can add this again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map card selection , you can over@@ write speaking settings for the application . the card is displayed when
use of the standard speakers ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words , there are no speaking properties .
using the matching speaker , which displays all features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker , which originally set the original features .
select the method for entering the desired communication properties , click on one of the select buttons .
select here the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play any role , there will be nothing .
mark this cross@@ box , if the property is supposed to have other features . you can also put multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor if the output is , it is always treated as a priority property . the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language , if you may know that a certain application will be sent in another language than that in the working environment .
to use all features in the area , use the most likely to delete , click on the select button and then use speaker , which is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without a job number , input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I comp@@ ile Deb@@ ug support but I get no trace@@ ability .

the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I get a textbook , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears that says : M@@ to open PCM .

on the map audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program SO@@ X has to be checked , and via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ monitor wall ; allowing the administration of network interfaces , rout@@ ines and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of systems and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu , contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ monitor ; displayed . the network interface settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have to be operational and configur@@ able , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is possible at all and allows the setting of network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are added to install &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded with adap@@ ting to the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network interface is loaded when the network settings will be selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this system is trying to automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the selected selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list , which can be taken from distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . by selecting the setting of non @-@ again questions , the setting will permanently be taken permanently . during the next start of network settings , this selection will then be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed in detail , changing the settings can be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can click on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s total functionality is available . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings attached network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Ex@@ tended Settings to pass dialogue with further possibilities .
the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server are used in automatic mode . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the TCP / IP information on any system startup , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the select list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the manual manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field , network mas@@ ke is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network appliances can be switched or switched off . switching of a network device is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network appliances can be switched or switched off . switch off a checked network device is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ types .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected , in which the gateway computer is located , must be selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain extension through the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org trig@@ gers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ esp@@ ace solution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed value .@@ DNS entries can be added up by selecting a contract and execution in the list with the buttons up or to be re@@ arranged in priority .
by clicking button add ... from the batch machine to mount up , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the group hosts on the nam@@ esp@@ ace solution , select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be displayed on the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address regulations for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in boats when no DNS server is available . in small , connected networks can replace DNS @-@ servers .
normally , the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . these are still in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The dialog New alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select a record of the well @-@ known host@@ els from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
you can use one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings defined in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the latest version of the source texts .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and install in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient , but additionally , the development plan is required with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended to use users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; amended configuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network are medi@@ ated .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 never found great distribution . IPv6 is expected to prevail in the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the spread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is allocated to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be able or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be selected easily !
when setting up one &apos;s own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address contra@@ cles with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet , hence its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can access such machines by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 is used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for the IP continuation .
the network address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section the configuration files , which are collected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered sometimes with DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . otherwise , another stand is expected .

it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which was the answer to a question that my wife said : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; do the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ inning on the band , you will be asked if the tape shall be form@@ at@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ produced .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for tape drives to indicate that the band is tied up . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through .
before throwing off the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not comply with the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the ban@@ ker is prec@@ eded by the DA@@ T drives .
after entering the band called and the capacity is driving &amp; k@@ dat ; with the formation of the ban@@ des . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the volume is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before using the backup procedure , you need to select the backup files . it can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a ha@@ k@@ le . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select in the S@@ ick@@ ers menu ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a ha@@ k@@ le . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog box appears . this dialog shows the progress of testing processes , and data through@@ put and remaining time .
before rest@@ oring the recovery , the files you need to be re @-@ established , can be marked on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band &apos;s drive . it will only be restored to selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a ha@@ k@@ le . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ...
once the restoration process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue appears to recover . this dialogue displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a f@@ use profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for the f@@ use profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to be made . the list of files will be updated automatically according to the specified working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . file that lie on other file systems , can apply separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files are secured since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental f@@ use .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
the buttons of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu ... menu settings . the following settings can be :
the complete path to the device file for tape drives ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is bound , the command is attached to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat tried to un@@ lock the throw at tape drives . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape will be cast off . do not use this option on Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat is switched on ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this string is host name : seconds , whereby the user name is the full name of the system that has been form@@ at@@ ted on which the band is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the period .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can be directly linked with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not for cre@@ denti@@ als .
check the contents of a backup binding . this symbol is only active when a band is tied .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users the quick access for example on problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information on the problems that can appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions can provide , with their help the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen shots , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with their help the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort out . individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed , and it opens up with System @-@ wal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files are usually found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the regular users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on . in the default setting , the list of log@@ ins will be displayed automatically . in the default setting , the box is displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line is displayed only if it is included in one of the columns of the filter search term .
you can also select another entry in this place , with the entries of the filter search engine will then select the column process , and then apply in the file bar the name process , so you will show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in standard settings and helps you identify the key protocol lines . protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a con@@ sp@@ less color than protocol rows . the color display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched to setup dialog .
if you want to show a specific process ( for example , in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to investigate the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows for viewing multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage your windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also available in the following folder : &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it system is rapidly developing for checking the program starts at the high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is why it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on system V in@@ it without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start with the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie s@@ well below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use of it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ clean Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change , then you can repair / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you will rep@@ airing the system to restart the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that files are not correct in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : every one of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scrip@@ ting on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K includes , the script will stop using the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called up with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to build machinery for many purposes . I could get &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , that &apos;s just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to say tri@@ vial : simply drag a entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six Run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or move the position inside a level by removing it elsewhere . this will not only happen if it comes out from its original Run@@ time ( or its position ) . this will not happen if it comes out from the area of the Available system services .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed when you copy them into a new area . in order to copy them only on a new run@@ level , you need to insert copy from the menu Edit or insert into the target range -- even then , if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of this entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case you will need to process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to add the system service .
note : there are no possibility to restore entries that were thrown onto the tr@@ ash basket . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper or below .
to shift an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a updated manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . use the dialog by typ@@ ing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
due to the risk of data losses , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ es , and now the machine starts re@@ fresh . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type , such as system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just dis@@ close without message if your configuration files are not available or in@@ correctly furnished .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about Run@@ level so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have done changes , you need to save them . either , use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or entry saving in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cart@@ on cards , user and user groups . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some of the cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have enabled system constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will appear on the individual settings . other cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed .
the password card password appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this cart@@ on card is only activated if for at least one embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable in the file quot@@ as / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here we can change parameters for each user , with the number of numbers in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the board map groups inform@@ s about the users of selected users . the default group , which belongs to the user , will find the user in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by mark them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select these users in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding from the user or group or click the matching Add button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ manager , remove and change the boat matching , remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change , change , change and more .
