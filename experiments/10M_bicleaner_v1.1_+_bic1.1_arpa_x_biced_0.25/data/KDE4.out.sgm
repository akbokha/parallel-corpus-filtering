<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the entire & URL; translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. BabelFish is in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, we should not depend on the translations without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other text should be translating on the Babelfish site itself, where you can add to skipped texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & conqueror; in spite of its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror; by making these light available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For further information on the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in functions you will find in the manual of & Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & counter-queror; select settings extensions.... open the card tools and select the required modules there.</seg>

<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView may be graphically portrayed with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose size is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the size of the sizes of the lower objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the size of the size of entries in it. consequently, large files can be detected, even then easily detected in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView may be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; -command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap presentation is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the right-area meaningful and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over view of color mode, may be either depth for easy detection of the yeast letters or the image of another file size, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can define if there is enough space available, or if the surface is provided by subordinated jurisprudence (whereby the error error may occur by restrictions at the sign of the Treemap). moreover, you can define the relative position of the labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of acceptance algorithm for Treemaps, the area should be held proportionally in the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always kept. please note that less space is lost for the frame, if the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the division of the surface is carried out for the subordinated entries, the implementation will be left. here it is for the labelling and to avoid space losses due to always beneficial to areas that are possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive second allocation.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent's entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, which was developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know what to do in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure. you need to decide whether other access to your photos are supposed to be able to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to change them on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. these images can be found quickly via your location. if you make enough photos on the same place. if you are going enough photos, then you will be able to print subfolder such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the setup site of metadata in & digitised; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget that, you can subsequently store the metadata from the database into files by selecting the respective point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? it provides & digitised; they provide a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real job, as you should now select any photo keywords, labelling and evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures that need the same attribute, and start the value. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now proceed with keyword, key words, as you frequently do in other programs, or do categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloged pictures from another source with embedded keyword, then & digitised; automatically insert the pictures to the right place. the change of hierarchy in the tree is no problem and can easily be done by that of a baums to another. the changed keywords are of & digitised; updated while the substrate is pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics features like different metadata. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalogze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos only, they want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it's not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! one begins to dream, associations, the historical period is back again, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed its perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos is more important than the image itself to create a story. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer it to the viewer to help Him about the motive that you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a labeling for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised; you can save a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as marking. you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously. KDE can even export it to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of Web-Galeriesystems. so you must tell the story so for the opening act no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already comes with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolokalization are already countless and become even deeper into the future. I'm sure to virtually repeat your travels through pictures with geographic data. & digitised; can also be able to open the photos on the location. however, you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all amended versions, so also for works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digitised; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for Eractor and Writers): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographers, e.g. to protect the photographers, then the name of a company or organization should be used. after that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support Kommas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for the author of the author): linked to the author. this field includes titles of the photographer. examples of that can be titles as: employee photographer, free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, it must be filled as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editors (synonym for providers): use the Anbible field to identify who works this photo. if the photographer wants to be listed here. if the photographer has been listed here, you can see the picture here. if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group / agency is here indicated here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although those who have no protection against abuse. each of them has no more than basic knowledge in working with calculator, or modify. the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important for this protection.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitised; will be available in the near future such a module for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, turnout, power poles, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desaster prediction, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this type of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data restore company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must have to be treated more difficult and you can't have more expensive than a few years. of course, you can claim to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your measuring space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good recording devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it turns a lot to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control box mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favourable program called IsoBuster that seems to work wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and & Linux. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the FormatWar against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything related to CDs and DVDs was also true of course for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to high-quality media in a non-propriated format. read the media with a description, date & author trademark and then on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals protected. don't forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskette retain your statistics for itself. their manufacturer's designs include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: diserror study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks stay the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the lower temperature levels, the error rate increases dramatically. some of the SMART determined the imminent failure. these are especially literary and publishing groups. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also save data loss due to an blackout, but these losses usually allow themselves to recover without large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest assured. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. remember that not any plug-in bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention that protects the protection against lightning bolt and that protects properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage can be used to your computer, you should pay attention that also all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers are also suitable for telephone lines and cable modems, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system before smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in an interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overspannings, these devices can be able to store your data and load the system. some models allow them to work back until the power is running. some models allow them to be sure that they have the same quality requirements such as a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk of avoiding your computer system and compare his safety with the cost of avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be done for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about your computer with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go into your holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup goal for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is not available in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more at your disposal, in the case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 a year, you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned up with the TCP protocol and included in the large companies offering a backup and a divider memory. therefore they are desaster safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you don't tell you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have been destroyed in your computer. nobody seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably safer data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are a further source for transmission ratios because they generate interferences within the data stream. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not especially affected by transmission problems, you should see in the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can cope with turntables on low level and can be scalable with a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses in the notebook and 46% for the workload systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft, or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the research process during a sudden interruption in operation is higher and a defined status is avoided. if a file has not been completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main cause of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 bling settings from fundamental physical borders. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final results are more deteriorated for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750Gb hard drive is responsible today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone affected by any data loss. so you'll be able to secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re-installation of your operating system, the exchange of plates, or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, you have a flash, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes a local and destroys a lot. forget airborne illness: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster preference is always not a local store. bring your fuses up the stairs into the neighbouring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a frequent reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are supposed to be secured. it is a moment of moments without a history and represents a complete copy of a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiating: a backup of files have been changed since the last complete system has been generated. this creates a complete moment-up for two time points: the complete backup and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Backup backup: a backup of files have been changed since last backup. this creates multiple moments. you can restore the original status to any time once again. this backup comes from a versioning system next to the exception that it is only constant and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, only the difference of files were really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come up with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for each month. every other thinner should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated IPTC information, associated XMP files, original store, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable, you need to consider and re-evaluate everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to be considered a certain vigilance. all 5-8 years should have used yourself as the current system backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuse technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this does not mean actually.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have the scalability with you and the range you want to have on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and lay on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBER; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2 fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that vanishes slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can be lossless, but supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is needed, but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression. this format would like to be able to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression smug (Defend). however, a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed free and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliged to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer DNG is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mix of XML and RDF. file information is available with an extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, but it can fit into problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the rough format will be able. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which is a wide range of applications and modeling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissance efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. for so long the pictures are available on camamedium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive editing, you can use external programs. if you go again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digip. in the section adding a photos to an album you can find a description, how you can already add on your hard disk. but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your album data.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these with the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and switch off. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is manufactured, a Fertig -indicator appears at the lower end and the thumbnails are displayed on the camera. if this is the case, file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed on each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a entry and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that by some digital cameras no all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the picture. these information are the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitised; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer, click the button to download and then download the selection of all your camera into one single album in & digitised; we recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option with the default selection of & KDE. once you select the photos, use the button to download and then select selected. the button Selected combination is available as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available to download. these pictures have been selected until now. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in front window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you're using the buttons All or Selected combination, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, displayed as normal folder. select the list of folders you can read in the section My Albums. then select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitised; download photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the required photos, you can delete these from the camera. you can delete all of the camera by clicking the button Clear. if you only want to delete, you need to select this first and then delete the chosen chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera. so the photos will not be deleted in the trash of & KDE; they should be carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera image, you should make this faster, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames as filenames. the filenames are usually used once again after the photos taken from the camera. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the image was done in which the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and for datory-based support. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options while transferring three more options to be done before the photos will be stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied to the author's exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all the downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date & time. for more customizations, you should read the help of command-time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in case letters when you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitised; for a photo is displayed below the name, which shows the camera in the preview. your settings for rename are stored and automatically using, if you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use any information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic speed during heart failure. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read more details about the information you embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, then & digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic speed, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is information about the date, which the photo was made, can & digitised; this substrate is based on image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same underalbum. not all cameras make this information available. in the section sidebar meta data you can read what information can be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, stores & digip; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to expand this option. use the button Advanced and select the option file-based support at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer on their camera is the button to download. select the file extension dialog & KDE; you can select the files you should be uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, prompt & digitised; you, where the pictures should be loaded up. select the desired folder and press OK to download the upload. pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as general concept in this document. thus, a position meant, which can be displayed in length and latitude. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographic an area due to automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>

<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has supported many GPS data fields, such as direction, arelites and cards referenced. directly with the correct hardware, via a detection of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of well known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers. either as a card module or transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels in general does not feel so fast satisfied as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how much color or white you want.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camperer and model that you can use. not all profiles are contained in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain any color mapping or Gammacorcorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma does not require to conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your photo is printed on a tool, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of leaving your printer on a blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles the fit together. this response is unofficial:</seg>

<seg id="338">The image editing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitised; you are therefore not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can set up in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filenames, magnifying factor, and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly edit a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have saved the photo, you can restore the original picture by using the File Recovery or button the button to restore image editing in the tool bar. you then lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Return or reproduced by selecting the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to return and get Ctrl; -change-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; in the toolbar you can press a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between is also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the photo editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image height, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full-Mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the toolbar code. if you don't want this, you can modify this in the setup dialog of & digitised; you can call this out of the & digitised; main window. see the section for setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print in the image file image and get the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or full sentences. all image viewing pages can select from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and expose print assistent. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiarrived; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation components, even in image processing. it will appear when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same rider can appear on the sidebar or disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the inscriptions of the text, you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. it means that all the special characters are allowed to use in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and want to use special characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have said it, you can either use the button to use or switch to the next image, the inscriptions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user-button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. but you can also write the metadata to the files. but this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata settings, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate more pictures simultaneously, select these from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering of the keywords, the keyword tree and a box box with the previously in this & digitised; -meeting requested keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adapted to the given search word. you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief at the input of keyword in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the corresponding suit areas in the tree. all key words of a picture are stored in the IPTC field of Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this only applies to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filters.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - file, keyword and search results. if in addition, one or more keyword filter from the right is used, only the cutting amount of these are displayed. all displayed keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and off. suppose you have selected several images in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection. then a dialogue you asks if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is selected on no keyword, which was selected to three pictures. they were taken with Ctrl + a, and then there was a keyword from the right sample tree to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched on settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and create and notice that it should be one or should be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you are looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can define a Advanced search of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the crossbox at the end of the rule and then use the button group. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why to insert a color-managed workflow, you can achieve a predictable deviation from the actually photographic or scanned colors. using a color-managed workflow, you can make sure that colors on your monitor or scanners are making the colors you print or publish the colors from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons must be expressed for the results that he wants to express. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorials is sufficient to provide sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informal decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image flows are fulfilled every six listed criteria, you don't need to take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image spending is via e-mail or web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB does so well and life for all so easy, why should I use another colour space, so that your thoughts may have to do with color spoils?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours which can be seen, the huff-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colours, you can visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click on information and then on information About RGB working rooms.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to set my monitor on my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB-color space or not, you need to monitor your monitor using the circle. if you use your monitor on sRGB, then you'll need to use your monitor on the sRGB standard to use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The standardization of normalize, identical, automatic and contrast expand from the menu auto-correction, try automatically to make your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects, which seems best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize this method scaled the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shading. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparing: this method refers to the luminosity of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of intensity is as flat as possible. this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonder at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarges: this method improves the contrast and the luminous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone the lowest and highest values in between in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White House of & digitised; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly restricted as a colour space with 8-bit color. if you can do so far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you are working on the white frame in rough mode, which can be used in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will be better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balsampled by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. they start it on the menu entry colors white from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adapted to the size, both the original picture and the preview of the target picture. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the luminance of the Pixels below this markers is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is shown that dynamically changed, once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminous values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the Shadow Adjustment allows you to improve the attest details of your photos or download.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the image show around the colour temperature of the white-scale. this type will also be set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The surviving indicator indicator increases the colors, when more than a color channel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this will appear in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as well as loading exactly this. any setting of the white comparison that you have set you can save in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences makes all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white-off. note that even neutral settings will be given another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the code depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires even more record field, calculation time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG available.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue, such as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the substrate for the use of color profiles. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can draw the text of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of tonal correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction. in the manual for key correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool color effects provides you four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar polarization, also called Sabatier, was the effect of the sensitive photopapier of the additional light. this was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors have been inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase is finally produced as a negative image that is not designed to create photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the process (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. he differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for a daylight optimistic colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. however, the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those who barely complete landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neonlight on the contraction. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures, the filters can give the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contraindications of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are happy with the results you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo at bad light conditions, you can reduce the reverse problem. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of them. all changes you can carry out in the preview. if Him you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple candy / contrast / Gamma, the tool is based on this tool very complicated. even if the dialog can be complicated to this tool, you need only the range of slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphite, three sliders are stuck inside and the right side can change to the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the controls and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box box can be set if the histogram is displayed with linear or logarithmic Y axis. in pictures, the linear histogram is commonly dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark shades, the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pin pettes can be used in the preview of the original photos in order to automatically adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow the selection manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output values as with the input values. for example, compression is used as a background to create something different in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values will automatically be placed in dependency of the image values.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and shop: stored in the filesystem, stored and recharged in the filesystem, and then the Gimp format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, means and sun stock. select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed indian indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example for the alignment of the input used on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically in dependence on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this box box allows to specify the channel which is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the linear mode provides a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a student to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with dark expressions are corresponding, and the corresponding picture pixel can be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking, a matching line is displayed on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: using these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that creates you can be saved in the file system and later is loaded. the file format is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colorpipettes buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the Red, Green, Blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indian indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. here, it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected at the luminaire channel. shadow and Sonnentöne has been applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiarrived; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color descriptions of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window is showing you a preview of the window. the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to keep these channels. if you want to keep Luminance, it is particularly convenient if you are able to reduce the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer is able to generate great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears to a visible noise that occurs in colour channel and their noise pattern in every channel is different. if that's the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any automatic mixer setting allows you to store and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed indian indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture displayed in the blue channel. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the working image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction capability. the development of digital photography is black / white a job step, since color pictures can be converted to the machine. also with a set of film rollers profile.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film supply with a green lens filter. this looks good for all sceneries and fits especially well-portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfiltered: simulates a black / white film supply with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orangter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic movement effects and can simulate moonlight to the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm bright and medium tones that add a little cold into the shadons. this is very similar to the process of execution of a pressure and the development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter after the right increases the note of the depth and three dimensional qualities of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original picture is (1) and changed under (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task. a possibility of keeping its attention is to keep the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under image frame, the module can be started out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you put the image type with a colored line, Niepce umbs it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), reverse it with a nice three-dimensional setting for a button and decoratively adds a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the value area for width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple one-format text in a picture of any item. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive. simply type the text, and place it with the mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need. the larger the image, the larger must be the character set. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button "OK". after the image was saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digiplug; tool stencil to apply to a template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu painting stencil to be used in image processing can be used to put templates on an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to change the file size of the template. if you need to add an email to the & digiplug; Mailing list digip-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied template files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root canal was placed for stencils, a supervision which reflects the folder structure of the template's template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is enlarged the underlying picture. it is centered in the mouse position. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. if you want to use the template's position. if you want to use the template to the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move under the template's image. take the picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the front size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. it actually sharpens it no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokusze is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correctness of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution, so that the same phenomenon can be printed along with only minimal differences. SLR cameras usually require more retrospeculation than ordinary cameras for the private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG image often has a camera of internal sharpening. images in the rough format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a sharpening device already during reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening factory withdrawal. you can upgrade to the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should not be careful when the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the usable technique is refractive. you can obtain more information about the menu entry. below Refokusze you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to record a little soft is much easier than it. use the tool for a soft mark with the menu entry and experiment something with settings. the window window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove mugs from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the picture. the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried first. if you make the needful mask to make, noise and impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses as many pixel on each side of a channel affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radials. they should therefore sharpest pictures of the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the use differential. it can therefore define a minimal difference in order to be applied for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpens and therefore pure-law in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digirade; tools Refokusze refocates a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture of & quot; refocus quot; in which it makes the deocative approach. this is using a technique called FIR Viennese Filters. they can usually start better results than insharp. you can start it from the menu by calling colors Refokusze in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular saw is much better than the Gauß-folding. the Gauß-folding has a very long tail, which is far from the source pixies, which is far from the original quail. the FIR Viennese Inverse is influenced by the distant pixels, which causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the main parameters for use of this module. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value is 1 good results. you can make a higher value if your image should be very sharp, but then pay attention to notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0,1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is very bad. if the noise filter is very bad. an usable value is 0,03. a high value is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness Gauß is caused. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you have a value nonzero, you may also need to increase correlation and / odermal filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Match size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. however, note the size of the match size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. if you select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary parameters which you have set is stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all access, color and intensity corrections to the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture. the reason for this is that many operations will not be visible immediately, but later left uncomfortable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compressed images, eg. JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masket produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by causing unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of uncertainty. the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the methods of sharpening correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is the sharpest of the range of the trunk, in order to create a more natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour table allows a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove undesired artifacts associated with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail containment p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass rate over the picture. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details should always be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="520">Weight dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth in all directions while a value is close to one direction only in one direction. if you have a film body or CCD noise will create a high value of cell-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatting [0, 500]: this defines the maximum smoothing factor. therefore, set the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: how often the algorithm is run through. usually here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle stepping distance da [5, 90]: elongings integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen, there should be too small. be sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step length [0,1, 10]: integral pacemaker in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More to Quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small. but he doubles the runtime. therefore we recommend it to release him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as well as loading exactly this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last long last and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts. the module is used in a photo that was used in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black Artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; smokers is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides chosen image filter to remove patches, and other artifacts which are coming from dust or hair on the lens, can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gracible noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindow details and the subwindow of advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel. the color indicated above the image and the color in it is smoothed and thereby creating minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance to the front in front of light changes. if the value is increased, smoking filters will need to readjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubricating again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response is removed or noise can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas, which typically become stronger, however, also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance is reacts. if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter may appear at the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and loading: these buttons are exactly used for this. all parameters for space reduction that you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2). the routing was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to sharpen the picture is much easier than one image. use the tool for a soft mark with the menu entry and experiment with the glasses. the front view on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiarrived; photo restoring is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artifacts, film grains, scratches, compression artefacts and local mistakes that emerge in digital, original or subsequently digitised digitalised images. the smoothing takes place along the contours and thereby maintains the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the texture is developed with another tool, the image error correction, performed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannum and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is even very far away. as a loss of compressive compression smug, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and shop exactly this. any setting of photo restoring can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoring is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last long last and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with equförmiges noise.. The module is applied to an Ilford (TM) hp-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo restoring. this time, textures can be found on an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner, which can be seen with a scanner. the original image is shown below (1) and correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digirade; tools Hotpixel allows it to remove hotpixel from photos that have to remove eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem with high-quality rough mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will be automatic the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to connect the dark picture directly to the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image. please note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and will automatically charge this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image. the window window shows the output of the filters with the current settings. poor pixels are highlighted in all prefactions.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durch: it is determined on average of neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is allocated to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 pixel block (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtration method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, out of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original picture has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignettifying correction is a tool to correct the vignment, i.e. exposed corners to correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, in particular the medium and large photo format, can often reduce the entire sensor area not evenly. instead & quot; vignetenquot; (shady) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reaching the light that reaches the sensor. Teleobjective also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Blendenser, which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lens should also be used, even with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpening effects are created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulated a equivalent transformation to a rough image that is applied without these filters. the tool Vignettieri correction is applied to an image of Centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetworkcorrection filter and with three additional exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light output levels at the point of the largest density the felt. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, entspricht.Increase the density to compensate a little degree of Vignetscape.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstarch, contrast, and gamma settings: the processor's image with the Vignettilt correction reduces the luminance of the target image using these options. controls only positive values available, as you have to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine reload of the exposure of the target image, so let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitised; image processing out of the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignment correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignment in the corners and (2) the correct picture has been carried out on the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitised; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colouring distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second-degree handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but it laughs at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of coefficient corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometrical distortion is almost eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion is corrected and positive values kisses-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value seems stronger in the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the reverse hallmark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value determines the image size and leads through a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image size.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialogue with a preview of distorted correction. values which you use for your image will be stored and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cushion-shaped correction should be carried out prior to all cutting or size changes. if you want to re-cut this correction than all the first. if you have a photo-shaped correction, the effect would be the effect of the falter.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is available to you this tool bar and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the ocean edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tons / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a verge-shaped distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation cutting out of the image processing or using the zoom knob.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some images such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective so that all angles in the image will have 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org site which is reproduced under this URL. filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust the filming and film sensitivity (ISO) if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator is changing the amount of filming and dominance of the color of green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter paint canals are mistreated to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to turn the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filming effect on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the working image below (2). the film's sensitivity was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the shlichés.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiarrived; filter film grains is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to enhance the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grainy appearance, especially in your monochrome photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, if you need more grains, so you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-based effects on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digirade; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and style live well for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls in order to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thick paintbrush can be better suited for big images. flattening controls the ice or, from the other hand, the hints.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the work is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and plain 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicame; filter charcoal drawing used colour and intensity gradient to create a carbonized design. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly changing. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start making.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top controls chooses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (edge).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digirade; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digirade; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works very well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondarty landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Waveders 1: share the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in an artwork using unsharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wipe out the picture along steep lines that go out of a centre. this is simulates a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpness: wipe the picture by turning the pixel to a focal point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-sharfe: wipe the picture to generate the effect of a non-focus camera. the object seems back to the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharpness: wipe the picture through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft drawing: wiped the picture softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shining soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solids: wipes the picture by random shift of pixels and simulates the uncertainty of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent uncertainty: finds the color basin in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and created it then, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate calculation and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel these calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your image. this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn urheather protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">The drip size allows to change the size of the image. since the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish augen changes the drop of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digiplug; image editing a range of Regentropes. use the range of tools to choose the area, e.g. a face that will remain freely. if you start the filters off Regentropfen the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelves felt. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through spike or turning into the right orientation. the tools you can find in the menu transformers or transformers Spiral.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase the photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of shrugging is simple. the big question is how can you find a picture above? how can you find out the missing information? how can you find out the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and specify the destination values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation for the enlarge of the image. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size, and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio maintain: if this setting is enabled, the size ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons save as well as loading are used exactly. any insertion for photo can be stored as text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it may take very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by expanding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of photos is not only a run-run operation, but also a often underestimated tool to put together a picture. the mouse is simply just the rectangle with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut out. this allows you to change the size of the necessary area by pulling in the corners of the rectangle. you can simply create a new rectangle by using the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button the button button of the image editing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save to the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the front section, you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in dialogue remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In accordance with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and cross-section format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is using aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you're centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, there are two buttons to cut the selection automatically horizontally or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you see the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data can be reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition help allow you to dazzle, so that you can put your pictures better. these Help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, harmonic triangles are an option to split a rectangle in a harmonious triangle.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division of different natural growth pattern, such as spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings, and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two numbers. the above-standing divider is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition is considered as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid auxiliary lines. these Help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-thirds, the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads to the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of golden spiral, also called gold right corner. this rectangles should be used to handle the golden spiral. this can be a line with or different objects. this one can just be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also derive from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equalled triangles. diagonal to leave these lines can be seen as a statical object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create a effect of professional photographs dynamic Symmetry. try your focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; image processing and tool-free rotation. select transformation free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Free press module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to the picture table. after you can fix it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is to use the function transformers cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option is smoother the picture a bit after the rotation. please note, however, the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All permitting transformations are carried out to a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be charged automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which you can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left above: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angles right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little embellished. this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you will get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to bersome this is the image using transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the picture becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you push for default, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the objective will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the lock, the image becomes a little bit wisely. this effect is generally negligible, but two scramings are twice as much swisely and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After scratching, the painting has unnice triple holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate this is the image using transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitised; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and, in some cases where these libraries were compilized. in most distributions, you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & digitised;</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & KDE; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphic; -dot; graphs. graphic programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & KDE; programme in a modern and user friendly & GUI;. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (thus a change in Graphene in & Kate; the graph is recalculated and in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; to open or open the Graphene in & Kate; Component in an & Kate; Component</seg>

<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphical viewer; is a & KDE; program, which uses the & graph; tools & dot; for presentation of graphs required. in detail are required:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphite, each in its own window. at first, when you start & kgraph, the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo. in this case the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list, click on the first icon to display the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>

<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of ongoing & calcviewer; instance, and eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & chgraphviewer; instance, or want to be able to open the current instance in a subwindow of the already current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can store your choice permanently, but these are also compatible with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During the program start, you can open all graphs your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the Graph should be divided into several sites. the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple sites, you can choose if the parts of the graphs will come on this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graphs.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The site again gives the possibility to establish the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can define a standard behavior (automatically reloading or ignore the changes) or program the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening provides the ability to determine the behavior of & kgraphviewer; if a Graph will be opened out of a current session. you can open a standard behavior for this case (in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that every time is asked.</seg>

<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track as XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlator. this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-sighted dialog appears. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you have to download a possible correlation with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded with an automatic correlation, which shows the coordinates in red. GPS spinning data are recorded at GMT-time and therefore, the camera will be converted to the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum time deviation indicates a top deviation for the GPS time and camera. lies the deviation among them, the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any column data from one place, you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference between 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options of interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set this boundaries here and then push the button correlated to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The locating can also be found and set up with the shown map and increase it. select the region and increase your accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be changed manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to the version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set is coded UTF-8 to enable a best-term internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings. you only need to select these albums. the albums will not choose from hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the range, it will be displayed quickly and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely explaining each page. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard screen, & eg; KuickShow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored in all your images. select a folder on which you have typing. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. the size of the file size does not affect the file size. all other settings are explained by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider instructors allow you to watch some of the settings from the album Reiter for front pictures, these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user to how far the action is. push the break down to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages, to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press the link to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and carry on them basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shift. the viewer can be turned out with short notice and moped. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without any quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module permits to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size rises, since no compression of the color information is taking place. for example, you can also find the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KDE-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from a picture to another. then select the import function in the main program, so you can copy the file extension dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. copied after you click on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodizer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can use a background color for the dialog box. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you must first select the pictures that are packed into the mpeg diaschau. after that, you can create mpeg maschau extras.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected from you are displayed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change sorting images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning the file on a TV set, you'll need to use the respective TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image process is defined by it. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt she should set them black. the name and the path of the generated file can set you under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. after you have adapted all the settings your wishes, you can now use the output of the film. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now eat fast or in all the rest of a coffee, and enjoy the diaschau if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows several pictures to print on a leaf paper together in standard photogamy. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print it with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import / convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original copy of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera makers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings to the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can save one of the three output formats and save the extension of the file. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you need to edit your pictures frequently or do not use the JPEG format, since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to cancel this process, you can use the break.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking-processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to once. so, use this mode, for example, if you are sure to test with a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures. however, this is helpful if these were generated in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available yet. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all pictures in an album. it uses the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the game.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the image of the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image below or enlarge. there are four types of image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the picture will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional size changes in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can set the print solution and the size of the photopiers. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance. more pictures can draw on the list of some pictures and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window with selected images will be displayed. over the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file extension dialog. for the last selected image, a preview on the right page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the image list and add there to add the list of the images added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures, the selected pictures will be removed from the list of some pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open the new message to your e-mail clients with the button OK. you only need to add the addresses and subject to the subject. the pictures from you selected pictures are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails, if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and every time it is used again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the correct path for your installation in your input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you have to install the GMailAgent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the dialling code of comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you choose JPEG image format and select the original files in JPEG format, the original exifdata will be added to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, in search of errors, watch. their e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button Close, you can shew this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the launch of the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with questions like you want to have displayed your diaschau. you can choose between selected and all pictures of this album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option is enabled to use very elegant image processes using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the seal will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names will show that the filename of images in the left corner displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. after that, you can manually break with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">In delay between the pictures, the temporary distance between the single images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effects. you should show that before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses any transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During Diaschau you can access a tool bar on the left side of the left side. move the mouse in this corner to turn you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and restart, jump to the previous and next image jumping and stop diashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen, you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the actual picture, depending on the selected option of the submentioning, as the background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphoto album; see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, now in any group, i.e. in persons, places and in group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories, for which you have entered information as you have received your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look at your hard drive and of course the current presentation pictures. in the following, each is described for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you push the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only images are displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have chosen all the people, places and other settings, you can view images to look at the pictures of your efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before its name. you can save with & kphoto album; however, for each person a self-looking picture, this applies also to places, keywords and other categories you have defined themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures beside the names, select the button, which you want to be right outside on the tool bar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. it has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keyword (if you don't have suitable pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to define what image for each individual will be displayed. in order to view this, you will need to select the image section window (in closer) and select the image section for the corresponding person. in the case window, you can select the magnifying factor according to your wishes, and select which part of the picture should be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are looking for the entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed, which is very similar to dialogue for the fixed image properties. this dialogue can still be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string or description of the images into the box or description, you can also enter a date, so for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can search all pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here becomes pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphoto album; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphoto album; and look at the quick-speed, screen photographs and entry videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphoto album; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kphoto album; for the first time start, or select a few sample pictures and you can try the features of & kphoto album; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as an interrelated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kphoto album; see the timeline bar here. as the name suggests, this glue shows you data about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. every glue then shows another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the LEICA only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively using the following ways: you can select the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, so the time data will draw. if you select a range, you'll just view pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user hand, the integrated version is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version you can create about the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each area will be accurately described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphoto album; HTML example-pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; -Export file will be created on the viewing site. you will find detailed information about the export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer. for example, that & kphoto album are obvious here. for example, you can't use all pictures exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures before a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most adjusting possibilities are unique, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Down on the page you can set different resolutions on the pictures. this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore get your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, and if it would like to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each successive proposition a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added at the next time. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you're really looking for viewing a URL. if you have been created for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files are not in the final target file you will need to copy them there. so the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described installation possibilities have included all three on base ordner or URLs. in these cases a subfolder is created, whose name is set in the output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking at a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbums, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. if you have already done a lot of time for viewing the pictures, you'll need to apply at the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & kphoto album; this work is not even going to do this job.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphoto album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import other data in your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it, whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to images. the advantage all pictures have been together, and this file may be so independent. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu File... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the pictures on two times. first, the pictures are not found in the file of the .kim file. if the images are not found in the file of the .kim file. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export images are described, which can export to the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .kim -files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual manual, copy the .kim file, you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copying the .kim file, copy & kphoto album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most pictures have been compressed using JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not compressed to compress the files. if you want it, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limited to the image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you want to limit the images otherwise very large, as the .kim file would be very big. here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... select & kphoto album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are personable to personalize the category persons of the resulting file (if you are a Danish) while this category is required during your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported into your database and which categories do this in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can use the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and look at: when you see pictures, you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see a picture of your friend on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will see the different steps of (1) fixed the information about your pictures, over (2) the searches and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but it also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphoto album; store all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file, which you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale security tools, copy on a disk or revisions in CVS, where you would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this with future starts. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphoto album; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings, set up... enter into a window with which you can change the settings of & kphoto album; in the following section of the user manual, you will be explained to the various installation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call a preview and options for viewing. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can define for each image various features, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog box used to process existing groups already. for any existing group, you can choose a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialogue Options, you can set up complete assembly groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a Mittglieds as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the installation possibilities that are available to you with the list of members. in the left list box, you can select the category. in the left window, a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphoto album; its modulation system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin interface. please find information on the Kipi website.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed by the menu modules. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, it may be that the modules are using & kphoto album; you should always test new modules using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or call the menu help. don't say, I would have not warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphoto album; do not work. this is the disadvantage, when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that are also called KIPI, is an album simply a folder. even if & kphoto album; this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules, so that you can use the features with & kphoto album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphoto album; the current album that's simply the current view, so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum has to pass on; the modules also pass a list of albums. here is & kphoto album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphoto album; s browser displays the contents of a category, for example all persons, then every entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for Virtual albums, i.e., for example, use the category persons, will do & kphotoalbum; so if you would have selected persons to view, and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphoto album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select the modules, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen once you start & kphoto album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you have entered your image database. at the moment, there are no more information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, now just click on the record pictures that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphoto album; is the possibility to see each image with notes on the picture, where the image has been recorded on the picture, etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all images Jesper is depicted and all pictures are recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by using individuals, places and words. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the images within the list: if you have a family celebration and pictured on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can find that the names can be moved to above, find the characters faster and allocated.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetical list, click on the symbol for sorting according to date.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen remarks on each image, you may need to edit all selected images and provide these pictures with notes. in this case, click on the right side and back-buttons that are located below the preview of the picture on the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, for example, with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and provide the menu option of multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a standard, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transition or subcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry to a category and place there to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this is ahead to sort your categories alphabetically. see.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the package by clicking and shift the edges of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a separate window by adding it out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, you click on the button options... which offers you the option to store the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you would like to check out this window later, use the button options... and here window a / off. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures if you do not have filters. for example, you can see here. you can configure the size of the front pictures, by simply down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture show. select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removal key or select in the menu Edit menu. now you will display the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphoto album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures stored on the hard disk. of course you have to view the pictures somewhere, so that & kphoto album. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures with which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the forefront pictures are available, so that & kphoto album can show you the preview of these pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it again. if you want to avoid the insert of your images, please get a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, click on privacy. alternatively, you can also unlock all pictures you can see for others. alternatively, you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister, control and select the menu entry all except above view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So, you have set what pictures in the case of the Falles should be hidden. if you just give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, so if you want to get locked out the pictures you want to get out. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to establish a password that needs to be entered into unlock the images. to set up this password, just select password menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not sure about the hard drive and the other one can read or delete the password as unencrypted text, or delete this type of password protection. this type of password protection is intended to convert those who are with & kphoto album; not very familiar, to convert the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures featuring & kphoto album; it's natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphoto album has to be viewed. this is why you can start a picture _ and video viewer. this can be described from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. it's of course the picture, but additional information you need to enter on the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can also configure them with the mouse and you can also configure which information is displayed and if available at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the context menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on this browser, see, matching entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you choose people from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in viewer, you can switch between them and go back by running the buttons picture high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in viewer, you can run these as Diaschau. & kphoto album; then you can download a new picture after a few seconds. as frequently there is a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus. started and stopped gashau through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>

<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the image and look out in the picture, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus key, you can check out zooming the Plus button in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of Zooma.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the tearhead paste the zooms, so every Pixel on the screen is equivalent to a pixel's pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only Zoomoperations work with videos that are in and out zooming with the Plus- and minitaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu you can rotate the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make notes about the current picture with the menu view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person, whose name you can have forgotten the image and configuration dialog of the image. in the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you'll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you're looking one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while you can view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in see a picture, where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have further features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, if you have selected all pictures you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>

<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then, their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire view.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of one already selected object, as all objects already are selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either to insert a menu in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are possible positions, the following serial menu will be built, so that you can select the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With extinction either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on users to adopt these changes. if you have invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then, you can cancel the input error, and reset the changes with breaking down.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; file documentation in setting dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed property.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL-user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you can edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the self-profit view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-friendly view and a small example of the scene is described with the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture will be selected, even if you want to rename a part of texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can draw this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire view. this cross marked the centre for scaling and rotation as well as position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has an visibility level. you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are then displayed only if they are selected or the visibility level of small or equal in the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need another arrangement, you can save them any way. you can also store multiple shutdown orders and change between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or below a view, pull the block to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, pull the instructions on the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored at the right or left side of this view, and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over each other, pull the facade in the middle of another view. you can then switch between Views through clicking on the views above in the views above.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible windowels are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring place, drag the preference to the desktop or click on the top left pointing arrow on top.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the collection bar. to prevent the switch, click on the little square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add extra views to the main window. in the menu view, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are sliptive, you can anchor it to any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window orders... store. it will display a dialog box in which you can save the window orders under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be correct. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render-Mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a fast preview of up to full photos in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render, in the toolbar, or in the menu view Render Modi... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Any Render-Mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image. if you want to rendering a small area of the image, select the section section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can choose the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is generated with only one beam of pixels, various errors can be created. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or window effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel will always be split up again and adaptive because each pixel will depend on calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray takes a beam of pixels, then both pixels are processed by using a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated with a value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixels. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel will be divided individually, and the maximum depth of the recursion can be checked with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflections. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box card you can adjust whether the alpha-channels are supposed to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams have no object taken.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; option to import the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler supports; yet not the full range of command from & Povray;. if importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; please write these sources between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can export objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import objects into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, check the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and insert into & kpovaults; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovaults; a scene renames. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the Help menu, opens & kpovaults; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed property. set here the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views. you can set the push-up separately for shifts, scaling, and turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values produce an exact wire model and therefore a better approach to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere you can set the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross a detailed projection for extended projections, all wire model views are used further, if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is framed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, a floor appears below the objects. the ground is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to check the edge of edge, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering the scenes. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precisely, please refer to the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders, how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field of the standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of handmade window orders shows all existing window orders. you can add a new arrangement with button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window order. new views can create with the button add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts anchor the window under the existing window, with box card, shared the view not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovaults; installed and now you would like to follow any more exact knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a sphere on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully note the following warnings, before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules for rendering will be applied as a result, you receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and just get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything flawlessly installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovaults; the following pre-set window orders:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a bit of time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should note the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry, so you have now a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you create. in particular, note that in the fourth wireless model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the camera's viewpoint. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of view object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in the user-documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything on the basic settings of the camera, but note that you can change the camera in the list of control points with which you can change the target point of the camera, with the left mouse button on one control point and drag it to the desired spot.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button of users or the SINGABETASTE, the wire model views and the object tree instantly changes these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you might add a quader (insert endable body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button to use or the ONE GABETASTE. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire view shows also the level, even though at the moment only as limited endable level. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you are looking for the object tree, you will find that you can click the entry for each new object. in this case, you can only see the standard options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to introduce its material characteristics. there are many different materials, but select something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select the name in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of Pigments only shows a Mattes black material because you can still need settings for the pigment. therefore, remember that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't look any color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you are using a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you'll need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need to specify two new attributes (you can also do this entry twice (you can also do it more frequently but the chess board color list may only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select the colors each time and change the colors in view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step, as you have to understand the basic mode of work by & kpovmodelers. the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget ONE GABETASTE or button to press), so that the ball is hovering over the ground, as you have moved the floor to bottom down a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now makes a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a Mattes black material. place a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you choose the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already at the bottom, type the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the pigment, then select the colors and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects, if you take the time to introduce some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or press ONE GABETASTE.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes of gloss effect and reflection reveal some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you & kpovaults; we hope you have already learned so much you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracts, the renders hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene, and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye to see the scene. without a light source, you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene is supposed to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovaults; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this submenu, and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you need to enter a name and storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restarting the scene in the last stored version. all changes have been rejected since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you don't have stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the latest reversed command. you can only select this menu entry if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog box in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or rewrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovaults;, here you can change the appearance, the keyboard root and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcut. you can change default commands for & kpovaults; modify commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting the tool bar. you can add and remove this option toolbox for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to finish rough surfaces, without any hives on the surface, and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, through use of an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application features a file browser where you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickShow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking & LMBn; or the key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. if a matching file name was found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and will describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context browsers, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP-function could break & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & KDE; additionally, Amarok has a number of own command lines options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use the key dialog, so that the user can not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / Templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or make it easy to expand the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with amarisk and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should lie every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the executing of external programs and commands. mostly the function exec () is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be easily accessed here. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all of the scripts. in this reason, strings should monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if it does not have any use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to store the store and loading data, each script needs to take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok uses the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalized that a new piece is played. the script might now be & zb; with DCOP-functions more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customeruclicked: submenus. submenus and itemap will also be handed over to the selected entry menu. to add a custom entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amarok script addresuItem (subtle menu) to remove dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; stops or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do for instance. for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Extended amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages straight right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main critic must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are crucial in the function range, therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task to give you the accompanying programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; you have to make sure that & k3b is started. then give something like the following at the console:</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is a audio CD; it's an audio CD; it can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the machine installed.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; files located in wav-files on the hard disk) and of many codeners, which are to be installed in WAV files (This Kodierer packages must still be installed due to the Linux distribution). more coders can be added to the program (if it has been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders are already installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile. but if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code is supposed to be used? the chapter Welter Kodiers provides a small introduction on Kodiers, Audio Quality and Compressed factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying the audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; it is not possible to read any audio CD; it is not possible to use any audio CD; it is not possible to use a copy of audio CDs; it is not possible to avoid an audio CD; not to avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While entries must be made only once (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration was found), afterwards the daily use of how to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freeDB from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is covered manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the page step, for example, more information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB will start on request of the CDDB file, pursuant to the CDDB tab. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case must first be made connection to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the tab card tab, the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so that the choice with another Encoder can be read when the standard can be read. it is noted that previously the encoder in the tab card configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that a already encoded file will be selected instead of a full & CD; to read and encode them.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of messages (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming (such as read the & CD; ends).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setting dialog of & kaudioCreator; with various maps (such as encoder, for setting the encoders). here, you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression rates and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG competes is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as Standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good comug for music by adolescents, portable devices and autostereosfacilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insulane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you really want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that will be entered or automatically entered by the freeDB file via the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / uses with & kaudiocreator; and the code to create file names and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameter is added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button closure in wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download / enter the information up / enter, so that all other information can be downloaded in the hosts. it is too note that all other information is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; for more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company hurt. all information can be obtained at a bumblebee by a & CD; shop, physically, or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active to choose a crosscross box. in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used by the server (but it can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB, the geographic will be needed to be used on the nearest mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the burden between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of Spiegelservern for online invoices of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What exploit program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more precise, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the wav files, the codiers can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first open entries for audio data (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined code. more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolation window (eg; Console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. check the device code name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and read it and whether the cdparanoia as well as the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; read the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give advice how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission on it (eg. by trying to copy them something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section treats the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the action to read out a & CD; what to be repeated for each reading & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compressed code for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 - 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings any time, we are probably not able to read them in any case of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device code is delivered to the reading program, so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device description of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to create existing entries in the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The maps of General Settings. here you can't do much to do. here, an additional conversion is defined. in our example everything will be shown / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you should ask incomplete information, so that you will be informed if data are missing (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The maps CD; settings. just select both entries. we are convenient and release the & CD; data automatically automatically via the internet of a freeDB file.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected during reading & CD; connected to the internet that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is easier, is a & CD; associated entry, starts immediately if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, you can easily changed. the directory and file name will be changed with conquicker - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to note: if you want to enter everything manually, you can use freeDB locally in offline mode, if you choose the database before. however, you can choose freeDB in the offline mode, at least the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following board map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the information call, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server to the Internet. how does the system know which data is supposed to get the CD? read the section above freeDB. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't want to download the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the site freedb.org and look after a mirror server near you. on this way, the burden is distributed between the machines. this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work related to the server, but there are many firewalls of the protocol 8880 standard bockles, there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the freeDB server should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one of the same drive on the same drive? parallel reading and encode? the author does not know, so simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: when you cross this file, the path / folder will be specified in which the wav files are stored on another drive. if the box is not checked, the files will not be checked in a private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as you type on screen photo is. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something has to be blown to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo facilities. the resulting bitrate is sufficient for a very good HiFi stereo system. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the constraint of tags on version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & KDE; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is organized in the previous section, is described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; we don't see the screen photos contained a little differently than those for one & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; you will learn the data manually instead of getting rid of them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be defined in the main window, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully collected from the freeDB, all tracks are already filled out and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window appears, and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings can be selected manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have local database, but the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen, the title of the piece in the first line of the input 'Update', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into the 'Update' title, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidily per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters in the commentary box. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the tab card settings; throw a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see in the help of the coders to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which obviously agree with the style of the selected CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; information about the categories of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there's a check-sign in front of each row of a piece. just the titles are selected or out. make sure that all pieces are selected or put the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button choose the reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is being read on the hard drive. the status of the program will appear in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you are trying to work with a Kodierer you haven't installed yet. pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>

<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings found to suppress this behavior. the only thing that is configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and encode. the machine used with an amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance, how the program can be adjusted for your needs, the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. at best, you can read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the different box cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading it? even if only the help menu has been clicked out after the start-up start of the program, without any reference point out of this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program) or from the unusual short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, has probably started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot add this manual. it is as the first version to add or change it, may it do. at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has misunderstood this section and therefore agree with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others he did not have some properties with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & KDE; support the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics to the screen with changing colour so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of activity every MIDI channel by highlighting of the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can draw in & KDE; each MIDI file from a & conqueror; window to pull out.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (decking events or text events). KMid automatically determines the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you end & KDE, while playing a song, KMid will start with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & conqueror; window in the & kmid; window drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and click the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry-play from the menu, or make the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you pull it onto the & kmid; window. (in several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the medium mouse button and drive with the knob and go.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or slowly played, you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the speed display, click on the speed of speed, double-click on the speed page.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button break or the pick of the menu option in the menu piece, so interrupts the play. stress the space while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically calculated that you will not need to set up a song. if you select nothing manually, you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries text events or push events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are played in the series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set a collection, first open the collection managers. you will find in the menu collection below the point. click here to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then select the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the bundling in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be stored. check out if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to add a song in the collection manager. again, you can add a song with the button to select a song, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the termination automatic link to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically at the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is enabled, and the collection will continue to be opened. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you will need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played out. if you select the series after the menu of the menu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or edit random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the list list on karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the button arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song back, select the button, select the previous piece from the menu, or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, that doesn't matter if it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map general-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus can always sound a trumpet when it was originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you must edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which saves all the necessary conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. premise for it is that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END options...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, it is specified as the Patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that supports this instrument, on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (e.g. with Ton 60), you can do a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a bumpster. in addition, you bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, in which each sound represents another percussionist instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds can be shown on a certain channel or instrument:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for each channel and any instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form notes on the percolt-channel. check out as an example the supplied keynote.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange some channels on others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following specimen:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the respective keymap must be defined on the front in the file. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, it will always be used patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example, to always use the Perkin patch on the pertinction channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio are calculated in which proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be converted to the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is converted and then it will be redirected. the value 4096 is used to do so in the map file (no decimal numbers).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM will make a keyboard, which is to play a sound higher with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards to play up two sounds up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & chmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find it in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view in the menu settings below the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & chmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; no AWE support was compiled. to download the problem, you need to download and install a source of sources (for example, kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic link to the collection before. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can reset the arrow key from the speed page of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, click the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & KDE; - Desktop a & Konqueror; -window with my MIDI file and / kmid; in this way, if I want to play a karaoke file, or I want to play a file only into the & conqueror; - windows change and the desired file into the window of & kmid; go.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. only you want to play the first file. so, set the automatic link to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then, close to B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all the many thanks! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I animates that, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonius Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm not a lot of leisure time for my Hobbies, but I try to try to take a bit of time. when Hobbies have programming, MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really do a huge anticipation if you send me a postcard from your living location or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to contact me, you should contact me as I already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my free time and get rid of no one for money. I therefore want to go ahead, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it works as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there's always the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window window that will be displayed only when information is in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu button, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchived studio. when you submit an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the printed entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, one can only do if & kmplayer /, can be changed through an editor, but also through the application itself. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this component is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must be selected from the menu with playlist and selected either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the edit mode or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change of [general Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / boot / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format has to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during boot does not need to be short, it will automatically end through opening a different source. however, this would be disturbing in the end-animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the advertisements of a favorite photos: & lt; Mbps; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodyguards; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory testing / some examples of SMIL they are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here is the path of the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">With that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave-flash can be specified in the directive dialog (KDE).</seg>
<seg id="1725">The counter or & kmplayer; is used in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding charging the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a pre-given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changes of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play of TV cards either through MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorders) settings in the kmplayer can be used in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should be selected from which one needs to be selected (for example, it's PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is why the videoforlinux needs to be functioning in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.) in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.).</seg>

<seg id="1753">The quick-level assistant of & kile; is a great function for the rapid creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistant (menu) offers some toll for the creation of the document. it can also be done some on the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is what the type of document should be discussed: articles (article], book [letter], article [report], article [report], article [read] [scrreprt], Report [Beamer], Foils [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this will use the character encoding. it should be used to use the character encoding. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding than standard. in addition, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-packages for & latex; for the connection it will be balanced only in the crossbox.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always use German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users are now worried anymore. it is only a brief description of functions and further information will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; provides - just like other sources of source editors - the highlighting of the commands, attitudes and elements (as well as the unmatching). by & kile; you should have a simple problem search on the screen, however, it is nevertheless noticed by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you by the highlighting time and time.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic verification of environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\, {command}) of & kile; automatically produces an empty line (e.g.\\\ {command}). this function can be deactivated in the menu settings; set up... LaTeX commands deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective section.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating the own & latex; files can be very helpful in the creation of your own & latex; once a DVI; file [framed file size] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the item output from & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for view, conversion and printing from DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the socket search, the elements of the DVI; file has been clicked on an element in the & latex file, the exact opposite is the exact opposite. once upon a section in the & latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding unit is available in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used by working with multiple files. with a Master document, the work with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quickset: the & latex; source code will be compiled and automatically displayed the result (if no defect in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File extension: in this mode, the DVI; file is set out on a regular basis. so, there is no access by & eyepiece; after fast growing.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In case of editing the toolbar, the three groms of the selected elements should be developed. the first selection box is designed for the quick installation of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The box field further is available for entries like items such as Tags, futies, notes, or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, image or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection for a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries. at & BibTex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; - files are also written in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The final radio box with the name of GrÃ ¤e is used for the establishment of the fonts of the font. it can be specified for the main text, the futile marks, etc. there are the following characters to be used for:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection of selection of documentation: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document art and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets for the instruction\\ in the class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays down the font. will not be specified at the beginning, it can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code is entered, the & latex must be compiled; the simplest way for this is the use of the belt or button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compilation. & ile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document failed, should be searched in the protocol after the errors. if using quick construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text which is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the fonts should have a different fonts. the instruction\\ hits {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} encourages the cleaning of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The interruptions are only required within the environment (from\\ 'to {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no guardian (number) for the possibility of infill within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to mention the sense of reading and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive printing, submissions, etc., these commands may either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\\ {emph}: this command is for the currant pressure and is available as long as long as he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\\ {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing the source text with the & latex source code, a step-for-step guide is now followed for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard, a bit text was entered, a few adjustments should be accomplished for better readability of the document. here, mind. a quote, a few positions in the fat and cursive printing and a poem for use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor's view or Ctrl has to be turned down again to the editor (at an external viewer), the window must be closed down.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into one & PostScript; / PDF file is converted. easy to try and enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format file format (engl. D e V ice I nylon). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). during the 7th step - by clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed correctly (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar creates the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file created from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion to different formats can start in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search is the direct jump from the editor to the responsive position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& ile; provides a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; -binary files. you only need to set Modern under settings cile... tools are well balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to search for the preliminary review, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source text and close to foresight. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer is then done so.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the appropriate & latex; document of & kile; open and to the corresponding line. it has to set & kile; in & eyepiece; as a text editor (Settings... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-construction of & DVI; viewer can't be open, you can make a mistake. if a mistake should lie, this will appear in the logging file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file describes the source code in the source code. in the editor you can always be used on the error, in which the error appears. to consider the flawed line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kile; jumps to the flawed line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once attached to the corresponding knob in the toolbar, a window to select the document is published. the default setting is:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With a selection of empty document, a document can either be re-written or the assistant to quick creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates are in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you must either create an existing & tex; - / latex; file open or creates a new file. & kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using a new document, some character strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables will set up settings on the settings... settings must be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">By creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it will be used as such as:\\ in class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to creating a template is the use of the wizard and the resulting entries in the editor. once the document has been created, you will complete the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template may be exposed instead of standard sizes.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and to learn more about Kate; and his mom should be attracted the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can be used directly with reading the chapter of Work with the Editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command referential, which can be called for the volume of LaTeX reference. you may reveal a selection of virtually all commands that can find in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click on the Ctrl button to expand the & tex; meaning that in this way, clicking\\ par\\ bigskip is merely\\ par excellence.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with covered linker mouse, the balanced text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, the source text of the source texts will be exposed in the Editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse the range of sources of sources and produce them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants like this trampoline. these are a number of bookmarks within the text, or the relevant key checks of the leap to nettest or last dive sign. this jump brand is highlighted as well, so that it will automatically be credited with the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processor is likely to use one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already outstanding care products have been added in & kile; important functions for their selection. & latex; special commands for their selection. under adaptations, the following commands are included in the text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">However, a complete paragraph (group of lines which included on both sides is an empty line). this extended meaning is not a text with transparent lines, and latex; -commands and all other lines of the source textures. the only prevents thing in & kile; is that the cancellation is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word consists of the current cursor position. this selection has also an extended meaning, as this command also has & latex; commands with a large number (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">The button of a part of the document can be removed first and removed by wires of the button. & Kate; offers the key ¼ rzel Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with its own commands. under processing, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a sales in & kile; is included in the description of adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been noted that environments is a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further orders in processing environment for a mingly simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is injected at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly from the command to the rest of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is injected by the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or inside the command\\ 'begin with the environment, it is injected to the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering the surrounding area of wasted ambient commands a quick view can be lost quickly. this command stops the latest environment, so that the end of the end of the surrounding area is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& ile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is injected to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the hidden clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is injected by the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the peeled clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor before or behind the peeled brackets of a & tex; group # is, is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many stockpiled groups brackets you can lose a quick view. this command stops the most important group so that the fusion structure of the & tex; groups is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple test marks are used as quality mark. for the purpose-purpose implementation is used in & kile; the sign is "used." & kile; knows this case and for two close instructional sign for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic plug-in for double text can be set up under settings cile... LaTeX - and will be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to specific settings (e.g., or French) and in order to be used in German or French. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the back of Shift; ONE GABETASTE is suitable & kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position inside a lists area (e.g. breaks or itemize) is, for example & kile; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close within a tables -area close t & kile; the current line with\\\\ associated with a close-up line breaks.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users found the columns in tables -environments and all Et-signs (amp;) to each other. & kile; seeks to be encouraged. although this tab is not the door, for & kile; some intermediate space for the columns is added to the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code that offers, it has been added in & kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;), three according to demand and the other two are for the automatic translation. all these modi can set up for different workings on settings cile... fully set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the start of a new environment by command\\, {Surroundings} becomes & kile; automatically add the\\ end {ambient} according to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">At the end of the button, the final letter of the input will be removed and, but it is possible that the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, a jump to these positions can be found, so that a simply leap to these positions can be found, and the following parameters will be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings are cile; set up... cile; fully customary settings to these lists. there are different waslists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as cheers of the common language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not valid for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ in order to be entered and the setting of complete mode is used. on the other hand, the environments are often used, that & kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete edit menu, or the button on Alt + Change button, the command will be automatically open and it appears in\\ '. afterwards, the ambient temperature is continued on a simplest way and can be completed by wires of input bar.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list of lists, even a first\\ item command will be used.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detective settings and in execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can be started or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick release dialog, or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTD.</seg>

<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to underdivide the tags in logical groups. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes and you plan their use, enable you to edit dialogue "tag" when available, so that an input when using this action is possible.</seg>

<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, starck, further interpret), or should at least, a message to the user, click this symbol a & lt; startling; -tag in current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and put them on with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar, or it should set this for better overview through some Trenner in several groups. open the tool bar set up dialog on Settings tool bar. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>

<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = basic syntax = basic syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that there are subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess tables (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The scope of content is the range of docrc file, which is intended to display the context of an context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (content List) and file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that are supposed to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc / share / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to use by & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -Community. they will not be rich, but proud to be involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the herniated resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send an email to friends, partners, or else to whom are sent. in different places, there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantaplus; users can download it and only made available if our team needs them as correct and usfully for publication, for what it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources are assured, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked by their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have to pass a number of keys. in the dialog New resource needs to remain blank (URL-preview can be empty) and with clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP), the toolbar will instantly upload, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the configuration of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not created by & quantaplus; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format. it gives the simpler way to convert DTD automatically to a DTD package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">Conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convert a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definification: the string that appears in the DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd will be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; according to converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these fundamental concepts and quantaplus, you must first create these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; available, available in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators differently factory devices, actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to anyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements constitute a personal collection of web development products for a single user. these are user specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; -Much up to toolbars, especially for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are placed in the folder's tree, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editoring window, the building grounds, the boxes with information and the tool bar. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">One can click the cartons with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, reloading, delete, or upload document, jump or upload of the document, jump to a bookmark or type of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right now in the editing area, lead to a further context menu on the selected document content, such as basic machining steps (cut / copy / insert), editing under the mouse pointing tags or opening the file, if the string is described under the mouse command file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor of the editor, the toolbar of the editor are present. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new features and thus adapted user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the data to enter this straight day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction managers (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and go through. in the display with cartons are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation designs.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as adding, remove, upload, or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, programming, whole website & etc; There are all possibilities for you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context it will be used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the user and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of the layout in Global, Local and Project will also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can send the available information to a script. the right mouse button are available, such as the script, edit, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of an elementary document the cursor will be placed on the position of the element. by right click, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it, manquickly attributes and namespaces can change. this allows changing the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartons at the bottom of the window, can be achieved via the usable information: the news window and the problem windows.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton display shows information about each running in Quanta script. for example, the DTD used the current document and all modifications to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the check of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as it gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively extended and easy to understand. showing on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command. the manual page of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar-Archive via & kmail;. if they get a tool bar in an email, they can assure these in & quantaplus; like any other back and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; files to your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with Starts of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in the PATH before her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close idea: what if & quantaplus would be to deal with an obvious, extendable market-up editor? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest Web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now even far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, & quantaplus should be; therefore, & quantaplus should be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above requirement must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; development community is based. thanks to the & KDE; -scaffold not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this allows automation almost any task possible. thanks to the program comets, they & quantaplus may expand. (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and has been quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of this documentary is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Conqueror; input, or helpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; currently developed and cared for by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you open. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not located on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. check in the section above templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project preference folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts to insert from the clipboard there included special characters to & HTML; -Scheme that it is correctly displayed and not understood by the browser as formations.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Scheme that the correct method for inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchors day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch the block selection and out. it allows you to select text blocks using the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Is looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed using GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debuggers.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and inticking of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; the problem is enabled, once you are changing to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol left from the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If you are reading bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries or next, depending on the cursors position.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu groups after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presenting a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a subfolder, and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have further inputs / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialogue to add a new tool bar. this creates only the names. actions need to be stored on by settings actions, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar, whether you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the visible area. it doesn't delete it from the hard drive. if you have not saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Therefore, you can send their own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, thus the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the upload of tool bar on the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or any other has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / head of dutities from the & DTD; it is meaningful if the end-day of the & DTEP; to renew, without the whole & DTEP; to renew them. if this globally is and a typing in the global KDE file is not present, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently charged tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this does not work with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus means that this tag is refusing to this place to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins listed below are listed below. click on. click on a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the Synchronous mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the makes; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external use of Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. it is recommended that the box card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes a entry for each open subwindow. with a selection of a contract, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Turns the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main windows.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue are affected every application that use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Establishes the behavior of Editorfensters. in the documentation of & Kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialogue appears in which you will delete entries from the toolbar, or add which one can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should not be implemented according to the environment of the mouse model, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed by the top of the project, e.g. after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project automatically completes. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example, foo. when you enter the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote computer setting, adaption could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default template. if a common collection of files are used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder, where the tool bar for the project is stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change it. if you want to download and change your script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are supposed to be bound. if a project of the reason is to be reopened, do not arrive.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Using this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can take a precise choice of credits.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by Anhaken or, by removing the hakite, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with project Properties properties in the classroom profiles or changed with the key shift shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible), which are re-read with project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, including files listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is invited to open the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to choose the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger Plugin can be set with the button options. in this case, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high-loading profiles (see in) can be adjusted as well as the display of a supervision for the content of the server for each profile, by poise your own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can change event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a certain event happens, such as the backing of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project, open the toolbar. the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behave as well, however, the entries are opening and open with... in the context of the right click menu (click menu):</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information on the place of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is stored in the core memory and forget about programming. this possibility is useful if you need to save files necessary, and the rather unsafe password on the disk should not be found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion from the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles are created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or creating a profile will display this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and installed Kio Slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate so it can't be read, but everyone with programming languages can be easily seen in the clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set files and tool bar. it can be loaded in a project with many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool bar, remotely stored on the toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most of them. this helps not only increase productivity, but allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; the best about the menu tool bar is staging. use and adding. add the tool bar will be treated below in the section adding of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set out either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), which can be implemented with New Action, a new tool bar code or tool bar, which can be specified in the dialog box, where the actions can be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a tool bar, additionally the entries will remove and action worked that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The Toolbar and the actions in them can set up toolbars in the menu with settings... and setting out actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are linked to the essential document skeleton, code cuts and files to link. & quantaplus; you can copy, postpone or any standard file system connected to the storage room. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted every file except text, so images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binaries. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in stock room under global templates. more information about the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. it makes a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in storage room under global templates. see in for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted in documents, but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples include the storage room under global templates. see in for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name tells you serve these templates for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar Archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File as template as local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the stock room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click the file as a template. alternatively, select the selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn with pulling and dismantle to the Baumanview templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only reads into a pre-level folder. it can be used in file management functions such as pulling and dismantle or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder right click and secure Site template, secured a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project pencils enable a very target-oriented approach. you can insert headline and footer or dynamically with & PHP; shape, add files or link with them. additionally, you can retain some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The storage structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files in the $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder in the pre-check table with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as Elteristics attribute has blown off.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders. if a regular folder would be set up, unless it would be explicit activated. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you can probably appear in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you or review the text for templates in this folder. this could be general head-lines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows you to fit into a folder with special headline / footer a presentation of the matching headline / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can also add context menu (click on that, right mouse button) to add a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor that can be reachable via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code in two parts: the source code Editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL panel works as follows: it charges a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back when needed to the source code, in which the source code is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that includes the Vohandensein of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are activated in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously run. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the keyboard pressure the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position is preserved in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronicity between the VPL; editor and the source code is set adjustable via settings Quanta.... View may be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically select. in general, the recommendation can be set in addition. in principle, the recommendation is applicable for fast calculator and a large span for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the title of invisible tags in work with the VPL; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this allows the reduction of the hensive body. therefore, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. impact words for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click in the list allows the modification of the inscription, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key wort2 on the content-column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages on your browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible just like the meta-elements. the edit of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to attach a external CSS style file by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursors's use is as in a word processor, possible due to arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and using button or remored.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way via toolbars, such as the source code, such as the existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables assistant or the listen assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; work in this release must be used to use the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style deposits. in contrast to other programs for Stilts, search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the Stilts can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2272">Input documents are covered as HTML files, when the support has been activated in libxml.</seg>
<seg id="2273">Activates the Xinclude processing of the input document, when the support has been activated in libxml, which is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can read with the arrows keys to / from the default memory of the previously specified commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to put together put expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument is set up in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully qualified name like "xsl: templateName."</seg>
<seg id="2277">Filename: a valid local filename on the system of user. on Unix or cygwin systems, the name is allowed to have the prefix "~" as a short form for personal folders. on RISC-OS systems, additional environmental variables are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2278">Path: a path to change of the working folder. on some operating systems, the prefix "~" is replaced by the path to your personal folder.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Data: the XML data or the XML _ document that is processed by the styling template. see also & lt; FILENAMEgt; and & lt; URIgt;</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to the same. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had done many changes, and at the same time corrected the entry. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed in this section. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the regression has changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters. later any amount of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare the text quickly, then copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost in a full-run file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people can work independently in one piece of code and changes. the original file (the basis) helps the resolutions of conflicts and shows the result of the expected outcome. in this editor you can even edit the results directly. in this editor you can even edit the results directly. the screenshot picture shows three quell files at merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you in the same and merrun complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; file merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and operate the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check Kode frequently, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are shown clearly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it on a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more anger, if nobody changes the deposit.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then shows the color which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify the typing work by using only the file name from the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2-diff3 file folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3-diff3 folder 1 folder 3-o target ordner</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual entry from the file names, select the selection of the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the list. open your selection and shows it again next time. if you don't have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button file... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, but then use a file, then use & kdiff3; file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging merge is active, the input field is active for the target and can process itself. however, it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can do this step later when storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define options before you start with the comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in opening dialogue you don't need to select files, you can close the dialog simply with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and drag: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file, e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how these functions are, it would only be to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; and now you can simply copy the relevant sections, add, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you can't get out of & kdiff3; only the text of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors may interpret the pulling and put text into another program as cutters and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path is too long, let the mouse block a while over the line. then a small aid window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a color blue, B is the color of green and C is magenta. (this presets can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, you see the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding colour. in some programming languages, where white signs will not be so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, divides the summary column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line is displayed onto broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparison list) also has a Info-line with the inscription:, the file name and [Gechange] if you have processed the result. usually it contains the automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, save is disable!!! (use the buttons to jump to next solderest conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference simultaneously has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group of the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group will then be highlighted by the beginning of the group.) This group will then highlighted the current group with the color background colour to the current section, and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, however, no further line remains left in the group; it's only a placeholder for the case that you can change your opinion and perhaps again another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might copy and add somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summaries; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources choose the options to ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image speed and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard keys left, right, high, down, side down, side down, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. you can also click navigates to the vertical picture line.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert-button you can change between inserts and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left-left mouse button is synchronized into one of all windows looking at the beginning of the respective group (as already stated in the section and the editable window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image upward / Strg picture) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, note that & kdiff3; all not automatically deleted conflicts after the manual. therefore, one needs to be differentiated between soldered and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy knob (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is activated, it will be automatically reputed into the clipboard and the manual copy expires. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally cover the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored in accordance with the basic operating system\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-out range\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-out of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of files used will be automatically stored and restored in the next startup. (menu adjusting - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialogue also provides writings with variable width to choose, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are shown in italic writings. if the scripture is not supported, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered illustrated. on these systems, the button preferences automatically displays an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tabulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you push your input or return, the entry of the previous line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied into the clipboard. the manual copy is then discharged into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line type you prefer to store. default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same files try & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares every line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging will not ignore white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a chariot mark '\' at the end of a row, but then could be put files with different sizes in side-to-side comparison identical, however, like a white sign, but if this option is activated, this option must be disabled. if this option is activated, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignores the differences nevertheless, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-step mode, this adjustment determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next undisputed conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) That's useful if you need to have time in many files less important. if you are only about time to use conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are to ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning by folders and through a merge. see details below documentation to the directory-comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file. if already one such backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option is not the current program. you need to finish and restart the program. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is published globally on the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, all entries are used for the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">For encoding the coding settings for the coding is a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this does not affect how special characters are treated and interpreted as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, can be compared and merged with different coding files.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can define what code to store will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define supply commands, they may not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only cope with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the issue of processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed in addition to the normal still another transition column with the necessary information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just run the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window next to each other or over each other. this may also be useful for viewing of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click will start merge and use the file name of the last source file as a default name for output files. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which allows you to cut off-cut parts or for correct the deposit.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is indicated (see above), the output of command is only used by the line. you can write your own preprocessor, which is exactly corresponding to your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users would not want to program this. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert into large letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This is an ergent expression on each string and this connection refers to the found text in the first clamp. the\\ U converts the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems are used to include a number of keywords: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you have experimented with sed experiments, you may be able to understand it and maybe you might like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command line for line space. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every match between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hits is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once. then you can use the Semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allergens are different from perl some details. where,\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and to merge. further operations are only changing the data, which sees the line-off Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor is the issue of normal Preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can not notice any specific differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a file. for this reason you can compare and merge complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal to merge a proposal; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes, without them really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... includes selected actions either with all (F7 keys) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 used as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to merge the merge. to select the merge, you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress. if you break the scanning the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3 shows; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and every file that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the right or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory contains two functions of all subdirectories, and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file comparison will be launched and there is a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge action is started, you will be informed about the problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical when its overall content is identical. then, folders have the same color. for folders, the age is unparalleled for his colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow, and later, when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. A folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize mode, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified, and if the option is synchronize with directories. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user can see as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging (copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge and then select the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date will be different, but the date is identical.. While such mistakes are not removed, the file will not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging will be a file after the other. you status column indicates that when the merge has been successful, and according to other messages, when something unexpected is completed, you should check out a final review and see if the status is ok everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set up in setting dialog, the file-like method is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of deoyster, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either lead the just selected entry (file or oscenaries) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target file specified, then in the Three-file association mode, C is used as a target, when two-folders will be selected as a target and syncing a B and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target file, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in folder structure. check out these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To summarize all entries: select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key abbreviation). to execute only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to contradictory data types, there are still invalid lines, a message appears on the flawless elements. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you meet all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (perform a single file), then a merge window will open (see screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select another directory, or press F7. if you are not saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem. so you have the opportunity to select another promotion for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were set individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not meet them together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files located on the specified pattern will appear in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder is specific with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden point. in other file systems marked a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to which the links are displayed. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are switched off. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursive. (please note that & kdiff3; do not appear on possible recursions.) This option is switched off to an end-release.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Does a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of solder, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if it is applied to files, which contain no text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder on a slow network, it may be faster, only the changing date and the file size. this speed advantage costs you to be sure. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of changing date. there is no real comparison instead. these files are regarded as identical when when copying the date of lost lost. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode, if two folders are compared and no target folder is indicated. in this mode, the proposals will be identical to the merge. the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In case there are differences, it is proposed to merge the copy of the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe, for it is assumed that the other file is not changed too.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .orig.If a old backup file will be deleted with the .original extension, this also affects the normal merge file, not only the merging whole folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the file summaries will remain visible by the merge of single files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want you to switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window divider window in the window menu, switch between the two views and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double click. nevertheless, there is a single file also directly related to the file. once you save the file, the status will be settled directly and the file will not be reset, and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, however, when you read the directory: directory -Menu: new reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of Kio Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some things should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively short and.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or a file. then always a file is accepted as a link target. (ftp:, FTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permission or change date. hence soft the permissions or the change date from the original. (please note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then choose In KDiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files, if it is used as a part, takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then, start & kdiff3; the program patch program is to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - KDiff3Part. please note that it does not work if not the original file exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. merge or the comparing of folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot commons) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and I've learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone this way or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not have the right PREFIX to KDE. you can't find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white characters is different, the line will be treated as identical. iF similar lines at next to Each other, this mean is because this is is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The Editor refers to any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost, however, when the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design an extra file format, which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly, No src left; appeared and the text cannot be extinguished. what does it mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information, how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>

<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is available in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automatic machine used, you should not have any problems with compile. however, problems arise, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switching)) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switching-insert) add text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders aren't appear in the folder structure, and consequently, not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folder with the function updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are indicated that identical files will not be copied to the target file. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior is likely to change in a later program version).) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source using the Labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already existing, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. underscores in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature look of all virtual working areas. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas to end their size to end or move it. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual work areas as well as in the current applications. applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The medium mouse button windows can be moved within & Kpager; moving is possible, both within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on the empty background of & Kpager; if it has been clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; but if it has been clicked on an application inside & Kpager; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application, and the entries to minimize, maximize, on desktop and beating. the commands have the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this crossbox is marked, windows within the & Kpager; s can be moved with middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; show the numbers of virtual work areas. it is provided together with name, the names with ordinance numbers are provided, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background is also displayed as a background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol displays the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager is determined: classic lets & pager; in a 2xn-grid appear, as from pager applications in some other windows managers; horizontally displays all virtual work areas in a horizontally and vertically in a vertical row, which is very good for viewing side at the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager-mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that he can display in size, view the windows as symbols or with their content and move. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screenshot of screen. you can use with & kgs; you can use a magnifier for different users. this application is interesting for different users: these include artists, Web-designers and people with a vision. this documentation should be a complete manual for use of & kmag;.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced by new functions. it is optimised for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you don't like, start a window like above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of screen. in the following, this window is displayed as a magnifying window. the image that is shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of screen and is referred to as a select window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & kmag; the area around the mouse models like a movable lue. alternatively, you can use & kmag; in addition, you can initiate a selected screen area in the magnification window (eg. window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse model on the screen (eg; on the left).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Would you like to avoid the mouse pointing out in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointing out. please note that it's not able to recognize the form of the mouse model. this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; -mouse pointing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adjust the select window to your own needs. you can shift it with arrows and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse button in the magnifying window, and hold the left mouse key, so you can capture the content of the magnifier tube and move. this also goes with arrows keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; button or use the & MMB; you can postpone the select window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the select window. note that the top-left corner of the box office remains, and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& klike; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into a file, turn into the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the updating of the display. the stop for this updating shows that the needed CPU time is set to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the updating rate (very low, low, medium, high altitude, very high). the higher the actualization rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will appear. the selected area will appear in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people suffer from the RSI Syndrome (repetitive-inhibitors syndrome) and which each mouse click navigates pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people who emulate people at the repetitive strain inception (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click pain. furthermore, it can emulate the drag with the mouse. this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain when clicking on the mouse and helps to use so many people trying to use the computer without pain. if you suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To avoid it even again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain, which arise when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by pressing the mouse, useless. and, as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be compensated for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click once you interrupt the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shifting is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after removing the mouse button. move it to the end of the movement, before the release of the mouse button is run. the intelligent shift requires a little exercise, but you get used fast.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool has to run out a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intellifelicity is switched on, the shooting time is set (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting, before the mouse button is waiting again, when there is no mouse button to get rid of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now is activated by clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt if & kmousetool; the first time started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE; go to sound and multimedia. go to sound & multimedia, choose the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slide-egler sound buffer, which you set up at a lower value to reduce the response time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & KDE; this function is currently only under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments, please find out the respective documentation to determine how you automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values that were set at the opening of the dialog. have you already pressed the button on the user, the settings are reset to the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, use the smart grit. in particular, if you have to get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response time of & KDE; at speeds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is buck, you should clean your mouse. that's usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as that happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear quickly if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball away, you would have to see the roles. these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the contamination can easily wipe off with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system doesn't interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just begun a shift in this case, this means that & kmousetool does not mean that the operation can no longer end through the release of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; and you can rework as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you're looking for a keyboard clicks. safe zones for the mouse models are & eg; the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent reading, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to move it into the clipboard or move again to any other action. however, it will likely cause them to cause some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart phone if you just start making & kmousetool to use. check the text instead of a mouse click on the end of the text area, while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when it comes to intelligent shifting the shooting time. later you can use the intelligent shifting without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be used, the Xtest extension for & X Window has to be installed. that should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The function of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and are set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; the mouse button is actuated shortly after the mouse pointing out. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI Syndrome and which is the suffering of the bridging pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is let go. in this way, the pulling and disclosure can also be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, you can choose the standard textbook bookshop. from the text box you can often use text passages without typing them. of course, the text passages can be processed naturally.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right) you determine the dictionary for the Worship. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words. in addition, you can balance the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary. in addition, you can read the word lists using a OpenOffice.org dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is superior and contains essentially an input field for keystrouting of your propositions (the lower white field in screen) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you're kmouth; right, you can enter the sets that you want to hear. each spoken is attached to the default memory. you can select from these sets that are to be spoken once again.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the working mode of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The Screen-Readern Edition has the highest priority. it will proceed to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of screen readers will be read, the contracts are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor will be reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website can read with & kmouth; someone is welcome that just enter the room. & KDE; -notifications are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text applications. text files are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular drumming.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order species are working in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readern. if a application sends the output of a screen-reader, while & ktops; just one such reads, this output will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen-Reaars. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text files as well as on & KDE; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter editing the text and give it to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replace parts of a text by other text, which allows you to specify either as words or a regular expressions. & ktops; is supplied with pre-defined string subducks, which enable the replacing of chat-emotions like: -) by text or for converting messages from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding shape.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Modification use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format into another format. in the scope of & ktts; there are some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that send the text to & ktts; send to a speaker. if you have set a female voice in an example, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has an adjustable rules according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter decides that its rules does not apply, the text will remain unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or one & KDE; mail to & ktops; sent out, it will be machined by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. the processing is carried out in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of furnished normal filters. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be moved from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be displayed on the following entries dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the installation of character fillers you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. these patterns will be exchanged in text, then the text will be exchanged with the corresponding replacement text. large and small-stroke will not be considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. this name may be arbitrarily chosen, it must only distinguish from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string chain from the column. the list is displayed in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file, store the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks a list of languages here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages when clicking on the mouse click the & Ctrl button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered here, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately through comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can only use the application qdbus with the qdbus program. if, for example & qdbus, you need to copy the user name. if, for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 may only be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2646">If all conditions are applied to the text box filter, the filter is applied only if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to other words, the default setting filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. words must thus be limited by separating characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you can find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & KDE; regulatory & # 160; regular expressions then you can use it in dialogs and edit these expressions. the & KDE; Editor & # 160; customary & # 160; phrases in the bigutils package.</seg>

XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transitions. but it can only be installed on well-shaped XML. the program xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">You can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the map speaker, or to a speaker with certain properties. you can define that texts by kmail should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; a text to the filters are looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker features that the program gives the text to & ktts; send, and the properties of the speaker, subject to speaker, send the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If the filter is used here, the filter is applied, if the text contains the incorporated regular expression. is on your system of & KDE; -Editor & # 160; regular expressions are installed, you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., begin the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here, place the characteristics of your desired speaker. if the text meets the above shown filter conditions, the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements at the beginning. click on the button to indicate the dialogue selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or delete all settings, or delete all the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker optional filter is applied only to the text, if all conditions are applied to a box in the box. you must apply at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech dispatcher" program uses an adaptive module architecture for language synthesizers. if you would like to expand & ktops; for use of another synthesizers, set yourself in conjunction with the Developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops; you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the packages of kdelibs and the developing files for the programme "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source lyrics of & ktops; you have to download or install the tarball for each night, translate, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktops; check first if speech dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. in addition, you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops, which is used to use the program speech dispatcher. the program ktachmsgr is to be developed so that the device of speech dispatcher is not possible and the script SPD-conf is not needed anymore.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this map card you can set up special actions which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktops; processed four types of language contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The Screen-Readern Edition has the highest priority. it will advance all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of screen-readers has been read, the received orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor will be reserved. a warning keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will continue after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web site, you can ride with & kmouth; nevertheless someone will welcome you who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen readers, add & ktops; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory news, the introductory sound is played in front of the introductory news.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this box card apply only for normal text messages. for messages, warnings and the editions of Screen-Readern there are no special actions, if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; Knotify messages read, run kttsmgr and click on notifications. the messages notifications appears.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark the text for a voice output. this standard includes brands for control of voices, voice speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of an example. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently it supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are present:</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional recognition filter (SDB filters). SBDs must start text in individual sentences, as only the first set has to be synthesized, not all the text order. thus, you can also stop or break down the card card, even if the language synthesizers are not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; it will be set up automatically as submission to a propositional recognition filter. you can change its settings or add more punctuation recognition filter, but beginner is depressed.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way, learn the setup of speaking selection by selecting. switch off the text selection, and select some features and check out how the selection of the speaker has changed. you must naturally have more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster with reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then apply text files on the map card orders or abort, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal punctuation recognition filter is automatically set up if you run kttsmgr. it can't be switched off, just removed. change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare the text with a regular expression of Satan and add a tabulatormark (Decimal code 8) to the statute limits (tabulators are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard stateless-recognition filter is retains the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & KDE; -News (regular), warnings, messages, or the output of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal shift-recognition filter, you can add this again by charging the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map card selection, you can overwrite speaking settings for the application. the card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top of the card speaker). in other words, there are no speaking properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the matching speaker, which displays all features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktops; otherwise, chooses & ktops; the speaker, which originally set the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired communication properties, click on one of the select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature does not play any role, there will be nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this crossbox, if the property is supposed to have other features. you can also put multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor if the output is, it is always treated as a priority property. the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language, if you may know that a certain application will be sent in another language than that in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all features in the area, use the most likely to delete, click on the select button and then use speaker, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without a job number, input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compile Debug support but I get no traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gwamer is crashed down and & ktops; probably you have to register. at Gwamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, possibly a not compatible version of Gwamer is installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application. if I get a textbook, freezes & ktops; a message appears that says: Mto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system the problem is that conflicts in ALSA will appear to prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an extra voice for the festival out of the Internet. I installed it and can't use it in the festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals added the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; where you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio, there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program SOX has to be checked, and via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when & ktops; & HTML. (this is that the HTML is controlled in SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to SSML subformerfilter, and put up the talk speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it to be read with a female voice. I have a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. that Festival does not produce errors, accuses the xsl file to convert SSML after Saber the GENDER tags. likewise the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character pin filter and now I can go in & ktts; not even more satticuise or go back. on the carton, orders will be displayed, the order is only from a set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Intersection marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, commas and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. use a filter for propositional detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">Gwamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by using Gspreamer in & ktts; call the command GST register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users are experiencing context with ALSA conflicts when your system counts. if your system also counts, you can not play music and read a text. & ktops, moreover, if you start a text order and then start another way. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of systems and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu, controlcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in & kmonitor; displayed. the network interface settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting the controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers have to be operational and configurable, so that & knetworkconf; the device is possible at all and allows the setting of network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are added to install & Linux; installed and set up. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded with adapting to the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network interface is loaded when the network settings will be selected in & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this system is trying to automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed in detail, changing the settings can be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can click on the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the module's total functionality is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings attached network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set up in the dialog box.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply the rpm package to download and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient, but additionally, the development plan is required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to use users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all of & knetworkconf; amended configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network are mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 never found great distribution. IPv6 is expected to prevail in the near future. therefore, this description focuses on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is allocated to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator to be able or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be selected easily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up one's own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address contracles with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, hence its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can access such machines by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = its own calculator). the standard route is required for the IP continuation.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files, which are collected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered sometimes with DSL connections, so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is set to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which was the answer to a question that my wife said: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; do the band back and reads the pretension information of the tape. recognize & kdat; the spinning on the band, you will be asked if the tape shall be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; looking for the appropriate index on your plate. can this not be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for tape drives to indicate that the band is tied up. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched through.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing off the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not comply with the formatting at & kdat; it must be formatted before you can be formatted before using the band of & kdat; usually a formatting of the banker is preceded by the DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity is driving & kdat; with the formation of the bandes. all data on the band is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the volume is automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before using the backup procedure, you need to select the backup files. it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a hakle. only the so selected files and / or subfolder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local file tree and select in the Sickers menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a hakle. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog settings for checking. in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog box appears. this dialog shows the progress of testing processes, and data throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before restoring the recovery, the files you need to be re-established, can be marked on two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band's drive. it will only be restored to selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a hakle. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialogue appears to recover. this dialogue displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this process deletes all existing Indexfiles for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a fuse profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can use the following settings for the fuse profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup is to be made. the list of files will be updated automatically according to the specified working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. file that lie on other file systems, can apply separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files are secured since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The buttons of buttons files & gt; lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the KDat menu... menu settings. the following settings can be:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drives (normally / dev / Tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding option of tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is bound, the command is attached to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, & kdat tried to unlock the throw at tape drives. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the loosening of the integration of & kdat; automatically the tape will be cast off. do not use this option on Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, & kdat is switched on; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users the quick access for example on problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information on the problems that can appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions can provide, with their help the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen shots, & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort out. individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the main protocol-file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed, and it opens up with System-walterright. the protocol files are usually found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the regular users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar, in order to filter for a selected criterion. in the default setting, the list of logins will be displayed automatically. in the default setting, the box is displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line is displayed only if it is included in one of the columns of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place, with the entries of the filter search engine will then select the column process, and then apply in the file bar the name process, so you will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in standard settings and helps you identify the key protocol lines. protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a conspless color than protocol rows. the color display of protocol-lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show a specific process (for example, in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to investigate the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows for viewing multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage your windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more recent information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also available in the following folder: & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly developing for checking the program starts at the high speed of the system in the & Linux; this is why it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on system V init without a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start with the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie swell below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use of it. you can also use a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-clean Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change, then you can repair / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you will repairing the system to restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that files are not correct in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: every one of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripting on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K includes, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called up with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to build machinery for many purposes. I could get & eg; a server-Runlevel, that's just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user-runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is simple to say trivial: simply drag a entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six Runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveling or move the position inside a level by removing it elsewhere. this will not only happen if it comes out from its original Runtime (or its position). this will not happen if it comes out from the area of the Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed when you copy them into a new area. in order to copy them only on a new runlevel, you need to insert copy from the menu Edit or insert into the target range -- even then, if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of this entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case you will need to process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no possibility to restore entries that were thrown onto the trash basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper or below.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a updated manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. use the dialog by typing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data losses, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard Runes, and now the machine starts refresh. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, such as system services will be launched in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just disclose without message if your configuration files are not available or incorrectly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about Runlevel so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done changes, you need to save them. either, use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or entry saving in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two carton cards, user and user groups. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some of the cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have enabled system constraints (Quota) for users, you will appear on the individual settings. other cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password card password appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This carton card is only activated if for at least one embedded file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable in the file quotas / quotas group on the file system). here we can change parameters for each user, with the number of numbers in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board map groups informs about the users of selected users. the default group, which belongs to the user, will find the user in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can join in other groups by mark them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select these users in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select adding from the user or group or click the matching Add button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO Bootmanager, remove and change the boat matching, remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system, remove, remove, change, change, change and more.</seg>
