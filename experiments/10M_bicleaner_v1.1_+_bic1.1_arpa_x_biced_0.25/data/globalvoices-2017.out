although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have danced with American music , American authors , and operated with his sport .
in fact , this country had such an amaz@@ ingly profound effect on me , that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ istr@@ ate , who wanted to occupy his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free after method Man , &quot; I was &quot; s , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration had only been strengthened for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are , and it is easily acceptance in a community of con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed people .
I even had a very sham@@ eful love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he continues with its narrow @-@ minded men .
he never stops the mountain with his opinion , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks he was a former colleague , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes that he won in the Republican elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party &apos;s presidential candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ lot person , asked me ?
I could not get Tr@@ ump and his voters to get in harmony with people , which I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic programme , the people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ ar person , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps does not agree with the present editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the play .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I strug@@ gled with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for her life in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son .
it still fits in the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were still Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much in my career .
these people and those who em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump led his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the dispute with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either had his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ smus , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the tr@@ ump @-@ voters to describe as R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about hec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account in their churches .
could it be that these voters , of whom are the most white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that she dis@@ ap@@ ot ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look differently than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ el@@ y@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 20 m . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white vs. all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in connection to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it means the big Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether My@@ th or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always have , America is welcome to everyone .
for this country selected as his president , twice the son of an Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose story himself says , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world .
however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge portion of white America &apos;s promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the rowing , say they .
with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a wor@@ ding with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan said .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; swe@@ ars the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone who doesn &apos;t like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the message said .
and all the people like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new US .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t destroy their love for music .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Flick@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played in both places , not only changed the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity for the trans@@ gression of the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English paper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental meeting with a French pilots who launched a musical project and made the youth so rare hop@@ el@@ essly .
the young band members take their comm@@ itments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you meet day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mü@@ ll
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located practically on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on the instruments which are made from recy@@ cl@@ able waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez started to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itated viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remembers the starting time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same point where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced by tr@@ ash .
today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ scapes Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world is produced every year about a billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ scapes Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that is fighting wild fish@@ eries .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication is within the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were up@@ set up and slightly incl@@ ined , a bill of that kind in their coast@@ lines are welcome .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ po@@ res , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that you just refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship of the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries in 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
besides Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equally con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed and work together . you can exchange information and stand in each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts , En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace . this is illegal fishing a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are supposed to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing was ham@@ mer@@ ed by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the screw @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between different countries , the actions nowadays occur in real time , trace@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange , e.g. , lists of existing lic@@ ences , news to susp@@ icious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to character@@ ize ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing companies can then refuse the assumption of such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo , and that they may even be forced to pay for the numbers of crimes , as in the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financi@@ ally profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant , which is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
among these practices , among other things , are like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indicating Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , the fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &apos; you must@@ n &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and precisely this legal conclusion is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has been exposed against criminal networks that have been distribut@@ ing licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been prosec@@ uted and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority on com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is always developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships that hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off , for example , their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be used by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team from African nations can actually influence global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch to the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data and can be shown worldwide by the position of each of the trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of what where does - this makes it simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project to run at which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel criminals , but also cut off .
ships that previously conf@@ isc@@ ated without license , and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since then fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object in West Africa to disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined the West Africa Task Force , as well as they fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with safety , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member states could report its first big triumph in October : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used with tra@@ pp@@ nets which are now prohibited .
the ship was still stuck in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the Take of measurement rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they should go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such special , collabor@@ ative work is actually working within the world ocean . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the Environment , Technology and Nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer &quot; the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela &apos;s return ) can be found in both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regi@@ onen Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ north federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continually , which makes up the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute deficiency of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s official adv@@ anc@@ ement of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Dí@@ az , Particip@@ ants at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s context in its latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious lack of food and medicine , the referendum held for many as the only way to return to the country to rec@@ laim its institutional structures and exclu@@ de a new government alliance .

especially large waves beat the message above pol@@ ishing oppression in the central @-@ north of the city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves , according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira .
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear any co@@ ats , because you could not see what many national gar@@ ages do not have !
meanwhile , a info@@ graphic takes the round that forms the extent to oppression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim after a minister of ministers - this has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of numerous men on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your minister !
on the road !
some of these protests as further step in the fight against a government that made up of their view little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be busy with critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more frequency and intensity .
some vene@@ ers reported to the media , they be hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was released on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argent@@ in@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba .
now as an adult , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano didn &apos;t choose his life .
starting with the brush , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed in the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret .
in the situation then , I thought that was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years , one cannot notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realize that my father was a thief , an older and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence service 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who witnessed the extent of atro@@ cities over the years , which he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Bundes@@ gericht against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that it does not lead you to one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da the prisoners are tortured . &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait for the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little wrap in a ceiling and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that a large cl@@ ump was silver in it .
on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and under@@ lined me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out to an open space and said :
there are tortured prisoners .
I jumped in and saw a song that were tortured on the people .
she looked like a dirt bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attach it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just folded there .
they cap@@ tiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and ch@@ ased him a cargo of 220 volts into the gen@@ itals .

the confes@@ sion was inside there ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were linked to eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down@@ wards - all were tied in hands and feet .
near the entran@@ ts people quiet on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you rest ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you come up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed there .
( according to survivors of survivors , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was accused of death in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , to death of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through former torture chambers .
the way to which you came in here is also the way , where the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of kidn@@ apping a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
at that time , at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; prisoners of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war yield are a bay@@ on@@ ett or maybe military rab@@ bit , which one assumes an enemy which one has fought .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who watch the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal case ?
he explo@@ ded before rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you .
we don &apos;t need any one else !
that was my father .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of at that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a complic@@ ity in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me to load what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I sens@@ ed .
I have children . if one has only children , one sees the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you thought during the dictatorship of humans , but what the bodies disappear ?
why do children de@@ duce ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
were these people not even families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act you can do to man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they used machinery to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and anywhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to show my father , arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt embarrass@@ ed and asked me why the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
he said only &quot; Well , I don &apos;t show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad placement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I am pre @-@ puri@@ fied . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture with subsequent cause of death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 year old child .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish for the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the judgement .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court sentenced in 28 cases to life imprisonment and in nine cases of detention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the initially 54 accused died during the trial .

all the accused were members of the military , including former military officers , former police officers and civilian staff .
in June 1976 , Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court section is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government issued the country on which La Per@@ la was to be built there , so that there was a memorial to be managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;

the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , the last month witnesses have been a particularly mis@@ understood translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be fal@@ sely , but perhaps also with v@@ icious back@@ drop &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was multiple shared by the social media .
the mistake was the trans@@ lators of Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os . it was also who made the Lok@@ al@@ lo@@ ids carefully .
the Kyoto @-@ conservative daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ law@@ ed English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate time , if gramm@@ atically did not replace the correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ fecture of Kyoto pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already included in the text , which they had received from trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not tested before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that older people were off@@ ended by in@@ sufficient correction ( translation ) in our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older car drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older car drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are not involved in accidents .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were produced by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a total of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 resulted from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents during the same period has risen in the same period .
the well @-@ known rep@@ orters brought in on Yahoo released version of the article comments to light , showing that pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly opposed to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) isn &apos;t the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure pit for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is case in the case of native language . generally , the belief that trans@@ lators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - the native language .
in this way , a French native language is to translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ a staff with English as a native language , which could be translations into English . this may lack understanding for over@@ taking , cost @-@ eng@@ ined or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees don &apos;t have to make translations . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , to be trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the dist@@ orted and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation , show that this technology can not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulas in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for cl@@ ist reasons - not to read or understood even .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but of great companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto city uses hopefully a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and c@@ ens@@ ing measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online station .
later , other users wrote that the Internet ro@@ uting of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV wrote as no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ caster records the protests of the protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups that contra@@ di@@ ct the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Dí@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was captured , and recommended users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider are again imprisoned again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ itated by protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission responsible for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation them with fin@@ es and lo@@ ckers , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable and inform@@ ational national television channels , I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two litres of so@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sing fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is accessible by a lock of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two additional online transmitter . this applies to the website to which the National Assembly carries its meetings .
previous research studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet service providers had to use DNS via the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request with such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
when V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was taken in custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections : the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ists will keep access to multimedia coverage over current events in the country .

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness of other cri@@ adi@@ tas who were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which it was not together with the family who lived there , eat .
shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ tas in Paraguay was referred to more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family , with little money , gives her min@@ der@@ s. son or her min@@ der@@ year daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for that countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse are - and all that can &apos;t rise in the context of a contract .
this is described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
following her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , relief and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude to be vacc@@ inated the cri@@ adi@@ tas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one part of the family , who dis@@ close their daughter in the belief that they will improve their training in society and making &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with belief and justi@@ fies its exploitation with belief that she would give someone a chance , who would not have any education , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will find out many years later .
sometimes they even learn about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomena , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ an households , but has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy strokes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the budget of the former military agency Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a official member of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
they empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest against protest and demanded that there were no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil organisations demanded an excellent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pioneering - if the first time in history there is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour @-@ workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , got bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and lost her father his work .
their brothers had to go all working and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
they all went on to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the home of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
so she had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
they stood up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days for example , she clean@@ ses the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ ti@@ ring the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some closing of the household of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from opposition leaders such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read .
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade her to give the reports of the official media about the regime &apos;s regime .
he kept them for intelligent , but did not refra@@ in with her . &quot; the house@@ er@@ r had found someone who listened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allow me not often to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would be able to learn &quot; bad luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , to be back home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that she had made her to lose her again , explains them .
however , it was totally clear that she had paid them for everything they had paid from them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoke , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the c@@ ic@@ ans , which cri@@ adi@@ tas are abandoned when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friends are created , I felt very clear that I was not one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society insi@@ sts the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go

bill writes to Egyptian users social media , to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians recently ordered a bill to &quot; agreed Reg@@ ulations about the use of social networks . &quot;
if it is assumed by Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
it would then be set up on the basis of the law that it is commissioned to share social media , citizens and citizens .
within six months with the assumption of the law , users would have to register in the site with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs on the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video files and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set to pass , as the draft is supposed to be imposed , as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be able to imp@@ ose users who do not register before the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and supp@@ orter of the law firm , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come by the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information to their identity , to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans consist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ics ( in German &quot; Senior Research Committee &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly in the technical capacity and understanding . neither authority in Egypt have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they could control non @-@ violent public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens , who apply a auth@@ orization , or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to lead them to a judicial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that there is no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the member of the T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative position against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who had been found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the veter@@ ans H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq have to protect the am@@ bition of Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the leop@@ ards of leop@@ ards that are in Africa and Asia are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
how R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team has therefore established that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza passionate about another site of their country , who does not only consist of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and focuses on that protection zones are set up in the Kurdistan region .

in early March , 2017 , the progress made for the North @-@ East Japan newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a local pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were killed , because the tsunami had to disappear entire coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress of six years after that , in order to rebuild the life @-@ based life .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of those affected themselves .
housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( of the regular slaugh@@ tering , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , with 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima is at 70 percent the final light .
even though , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( the first instance , cas@@ u@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle in definitive spare parts .
after three @-@ fold disaster , nearly 80 000 people looked forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such a rule .
in 2011 , almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of ev@@ acu@@ ated by the disaster in bond@@ age were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune , will open their doors until December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing ports are re @-@ commissioned in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tsunami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have under@@ gone extensively .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the &quot; nuclear war zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent in the same state as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can be only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native people being prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , as their emp@@ ower@@ ment has changed over the tsunami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native people in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population , measures taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in disasters prevention was done .
how it stands for those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the location of ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been a witness of the worst , disaster caused , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led to permanent sub@@ mar@@ es .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ hausen , is more than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper heating , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to compete with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences initially seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get fewer attention when they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the common practice of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man talks about the time she worked in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva from a widely used photo .
an Brazilian student at the age of 33 , this week was delivered to intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer was defeated at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia a protest against the head . nationwide took millions of demonstr@@ ators in protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , there is also the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his drum@@ stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would be a police officer of a prot@@ esters and landing on the intensive care station , would be able to see his face for six months on TV and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Dis@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z recorded video on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edi@@ ts shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in the social networks .
in the bottom shown below , one sees the attack on sail@@ or from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state of State , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to remain part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
from : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for additional violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked on the intensive care station after being attacked by a polic@@ eman that struck him with a whi@@ p on his face .
police Phen@@ omen@@ on
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen set up protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ mol@@ ding and tear gas .
S &amp; D member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media are prot@@ esting , the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo told specifically about a cereb@@ ral glass window to illustrate the image of their cover pages .
in contrast , O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand @-@ driven bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific cause .
this must be recogni@@ zable if one is strictly opposed to any form of non@@ damage .
even here , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd basis , and the typical violence of the military police are swe@@ pt through headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the In@@ spec@@ tus forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba opens the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - unknown , regardless of the fact that there is no notable sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar cane factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the job .
others signed and comm@@ utes a day to factories that gr@@ ind still .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dat@@ env@@ eter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane is not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene reminds me of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would not be kept , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar@@ cane industry already resistance the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the refin@@ ing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly more competitive they were incur@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar ranges between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO report , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day of today &apos;s day will go down to history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ del Castro &apos;s first words during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar@@ cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respondents have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first time year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could recover any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ run factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; as@@ sures them .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , where the construction of it helped , helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ station was er@@ ased out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services provided by the plants in the municipalities in which they were , created .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former President in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that they were not in operation for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always for better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane made , or better , when they began to stop them , they also stopped to asph@@ er@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future , many young people left the region too .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty killed the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , nevertheless he gives the lies that told him not .
they tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene comes with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in strength , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations Youth Use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and receive its own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young Nations communities in the whole Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do not do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , mobile recording studios have been working directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and operated in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars together .
the workshop will rise so that the young participants in our conversations such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever they will come into the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actor .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells example the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears &quot; , a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mainly indigenous young women were killed or murdered .
the cases were mostly not explained .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important to the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung at Cre@@ e .
they received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group , who , with them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like I wouldn &apos;t ever care for me
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m trying to go on earth for my days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the day you &apos;ll get to our scre@@ am
because we lost our way in life our way in life
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead our youth as well .
thus , they can do that , for which it is determined by the Creator .
in the commentary text , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes in Japan are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( regular intervals ) outside of a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of each restaurant .
to show potential customers , what exactly will be on the menu , will be found near the entran@@ ces sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( of the least , &quot; plasma models of the dishes &quot; ) from every food that is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes , and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usual they do not even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now on special sales : new with plastic stra@@ ined mobile tapes , such as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some shot refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences will become increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part in the Tokyo Station &apos;s exhibition .
and here is an apple , which keep your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight to coma .
some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own art work . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping with white rice is served .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ y my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ t@@ less ice cream .
furthermore there are rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and le@@ yb@@ den@@ ers from dried salmon .
other sk@@ inn@@ ed plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 of the regular exercise .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to exposure to the restaurant industry .

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chief and rub@@ ella regularly appeared in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the dream or to the con@@ greg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind every body , behind each bone , in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of zah@@ ll@@ os@@ er parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug dealers &quot; ) to live this victims , and stories of people are told by the struggle between law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; ) tells stories about these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking secret tom@@ bs according to his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father to only one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task , which we have asked us to go away and to tom@@ bs , after the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15 he should return again , but he never returned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t pay her out because they demand a death client .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who seek fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and state management .
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this entry from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
illness and sens@@ ations journ@@ alism do I know for some years now .
I have passed every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminals and experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal or look at this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks he &apos;s great . and it &apos;s not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is what would they have lost to those who have lost someone and those who fear them so much .
I see our weakness , when stories are to blo@@ om numbers in a statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of mankind is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is thus justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; located &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to say that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; ex@@ pressing in the main city district : as a family with threats of threats , it describes how armed criminals were destroyed for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed the business , but also their family torn apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , if you would dissolve my deep @-@ ro@@ oted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I must learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Bryan is a father@@ less and he tells that he had to teach himself , how to make a egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live with them .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood has been over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a past car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings after the civil security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the Prosec@@ ution was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ ates to an average of 8,5 murders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories still live in view of the headlines . this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is created in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers that has tortured the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he uses , include pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to exp@@ ose a rum@@ or , or to exp@@ ose a fake .
but how is the years after something the first time appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether or true , ten@@ ds to be continued .
let us assume this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been completely mis@@ leading , used trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there are questions about our desire to do in pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker stro@@ ked the place San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te round and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglec@@ ted and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous pile of impact holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , tan@@ ker fell victim to the victim of the tank .
representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a cinemas near , which was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup .
houses viol@@ ate and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to their di@@ vin@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the grey scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows ranks of the hollow body , which are rounded up on the floor while they look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo has been dra@@ fted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically reduced by atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers could not be confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a population of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
only using satellite imag@@ ery could be illustrated by the follow @-@ up time .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again as the evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chiev@@ ous use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure issues ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further bring personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge was also linked to the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee b@@ lows , rape and some dead , some were killed by burning .
while others reported on violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported as the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ dic @-@ Arabian news page , which said in 2012 , who participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in 2012 . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to create this information .
the original contribution will be accessed by the last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AFP as their source called , had also been attributed to Th@@ an His statement , but had not brought the picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false kiss goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted photo search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the discussed picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixer , private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have some false reports for@@ warded , united others have tried to exp@@ ose the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have examples of the mis@@ sive use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on what page they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range clearly than by the language .
several examples of mis@@ sive use can be used in some cases ( which were also linked in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
landmark examples of wrong copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries refer to pages or servers , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum in an online discussion forum as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Myanmar , 2017 .
the Government of Myanmar published an accuracy of what it was as &quot; deliberately , in @-@ definition messages and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;

this post office , who set itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT a Muslims to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein took place in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the right @-@ standing news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar war jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;

they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were alleged in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with no religious context were picked up in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposed to have been written by a &quot; Fr Juan Carlos Martos &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre resulted in circulation , and translated discussion forums such as this in Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message which was included in the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Martos .
there are also other confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , ag@@ gregate ators and pages in the following countries ( on portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are not completely trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and ro@@ oted in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which has been published only after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture could possibly be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
Fra@@ mes and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that passes these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in relation to the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - in defence of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . it is therefore worthwhile to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when reading these images can no longer be able to give faith .
with social media , there are some people who have un@@ intended for the share of practicing the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the rec@@ eding of images of a turn@@ table comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures even require of the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern is that violent images are readers , and spectators des@@ ti@@ ze and their ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which in@@ struct how violent media act on it to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists have experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you are thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture suggests a little suggests , which can actually be used in context or completely mis@@ sive way .
any inquiry into false statements , however , should also be considered as internationally as they can .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons was used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. unmistak@@ able ) tries to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to be translated .
such words are available in any language : they express some situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brake ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to a simple translation .
one word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full statement and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected in an online list all the time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba your parents in recognition of what we have spent in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being caught in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words :
they ent@@ ails other cultures , reveal other minds , and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you can influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish and show more of this &quot; unmistak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; who are very appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to invite their favorite spots here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the Sri Lanka island is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually takes place in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya moved into 15 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are killed because of the floods and s@@ lu@@ ct@@ ment .
more than 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence varieties .
the ra@@ ins dropped on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters of the waters declined slowly in some areas .
health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos provide an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ bre@@ ach crisis , Save the Children , after further rainfall are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood at the high water , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the last ret@@ ard@@ ant water column of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and five are completed for transport@@ ing emergency deliveries to the residents in their flooded villages .
several organizations and Star@@ tu@@ ps have also explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for everyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share your site data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ence center will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the trop@@ hy Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; button , allowing users to give us a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then rel@@ ayed to the s@@ ant@@ ine Red Cross .

when in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend .
I trust her my four years old daughter , she trusted her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we are calling par@@ olen for women &apos;s rights .
in the next post , we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a US flag , other sk@@ im@@ ed par@@ ole against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this entertainment already .
people , with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separ@@ ating me - the Sah@@ ar whom they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
she mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective performance , that as soon as Muslims , which , as I do not fit , mus@@ li@@ zed .
un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed will be
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western presentation , religion has been deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims who have colonial @-@ books since centuries in the re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims .
this temp@@ ting pron@@ unci@@ ation is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said dis@@ cer@@ ate the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue .
I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how these powerful , f@@ law@@ lessly nar@@ rative is domin@@ ating our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate for 2016 .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are ham@@ mer@@ ed to carry their head in public buildings and su@@ ction Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group perpet@@ rates his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women , lead the movements for change .
it looks beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were hi@@ ther@@ to with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively collec@@ tively occupied our collective predomin@@ ance of der@@ art deeply and f@@ law@@ ed , that often , Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ ret@@ inal attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ans .
because of these stories we tell and because of the kind we have to tell , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , helping us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to compreh@@ end the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .

four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ resses of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were innocent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an ir@@ reversible Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat a pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ching my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ or@@ am that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ esting , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must have no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of fine @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the kind we have to tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bes exists in more than just a stranger who breaks his head scarf .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .

use by use .
I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my prec@@ urs@@ or , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor , my rock in the surf that I &apos;m Muslim when they could take through the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the most evening ritual with my daughter if I kept them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect you who are called the Koran and the Q@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , to the evil which one can see and the evil which one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

Muslim is to be to speak the prayers , which she said to me if I have a bad day .
Muslim lies in it , as she taught me to relate to God , Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a nation that has been colonial - over centuries - by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded by a company with the name of honest British Ost@@ ini@@ ums Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;

belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at risk .
Muslim is to be knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to have colonial all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means that the first fli@@ pper of the history was thrown off over a Muslim country in front of a century .

an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is back home and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history has recorded four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four @-@ ten years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slave by the name of Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous education print@@ ings , which we ste@@ er in our news editors .

and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now run the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by having created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years before she had not yet existed ; now , there are large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware , as I was as old now , as it is now my daughter , but that made me today an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I have left here like a baking track in my speech .
things that are perhaps rec@@ olle@@ ctions , as in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;

why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are to be led by the monkeys of the &quot; others &quot; in the public performance , four decades ago became Scientific of Stan@@ ford .
we must imagine even un@@ comfortable questions , as well as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other handmade &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ator wants to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller count , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be an option , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about an other initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ al@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written in the written word but on the spoken word . it is a try to preserve the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to those born children there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities which accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don &apos;t have to forget to belong to .
while &quot; listening is often linked to understand , &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening to &quot; how to appreciate , to feel to touch . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story initially in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their display lead to it that the listen@@ ers will en@@ force on it .
they call laughter and emotions , than the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou considers the opportunity to explain the common customs of stor@@ yt@@ elling .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara told the be@@ ak from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the meaning of his fi@@ ves , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ ism he shares his feeling of what is said :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States of Neu@@ fest@@ ation of State debt
with the aim of a re @-@ review of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march was launched at the pu@@ ert@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ ch@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ enship for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church in Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princip@@ ality of the debt of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , ben@@ ch@@ men and government agencies , who are responsible for debt , shall be considered for their corruption .
we demand an financial audit and a tap committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a firm , our working conditions attached to the economy .
we will be pres@@ pres@@ sive and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the United States of State , suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law responsible for state responsibility as an alternative to the existing stat@@ ute view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
from the outside , measures imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens are threatened by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Doc@@ tors &apos; finished books within three to five days , shot excer@@ pts from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ signia ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that has been published last year and is available here . includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of supp@@ ression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wishes to be built , like movements for free knowledge , and what the true costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and make some sense from our different experience .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted in the Ad@@ ra prison directory , which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us can begin to reflect on their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer of open source and digital activist has been detained in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to the Ad@@ ra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military dec@@ or , to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken hold of his cell &apos;s military court in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that , on November 12 , 2015 , she contacted themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge from a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in bringing access to the Internet and to make public access to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently passes the Director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes , looking for the work that he started working with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ side of numerous civilians and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS it all would go on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a time @-@ capsule which will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able to the public and for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el was not able to close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my overall life with that , of freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in custody .
I have learned to read and speak English well , to write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other things to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he gave me the internet .
he also taught others , how they use computers , at least in theory , without having actually held their hands in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a Pro@@ ven Diary , which she wrote in prison in 2012 by 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ashed the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is licensed free .
accounting for Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book by Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I reconc@@ ile in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , arm@@ chairs and guard
I forget the cr@@ ushing of the prison
and I went in every detail of your voice and words .
I carry with passion for myself ,
if your eyes are saying ,
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I bear myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
one year passes away , my soul

I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage &apos;s monster
Bass@@ els history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime &apos;s Bashar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5.000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convicted Director of custody for detention again
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption , where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state machine , which was committed to corruption .
there are Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and detained with four other def@@ endants in 2010 and sentenced to 22 million me@@ ticul@@ al ( approximately 800 000 euros ) for 22 years imprisonment .
the money was from public funds of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and promp@@ ted his re @-@ setting for the company that happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which promp@@ ted the request , there would be no obstac@@ le to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , as the company had no discipl@@ ines after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not represent the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which sets itself for public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re@@ locate the director :
poses a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have initiated a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act against the contra@@ sts .
the company kept silent however , and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps to use the relevant functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior as well as &quot; contra@@ di@@ ct &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be counsel@@ or after he was sentenced to jail and half of them had been lowered .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has failed to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped hurt damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ tory !

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or spher@@ es .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people from East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold scrip@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the as@@ cen@@ sion has given the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements to the word .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat them in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not call them automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the use of his use have been cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ m@@ ical words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ages ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ nut@@ zer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was removed today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in spirit @-@ rich manner , if she knew how he could lin@@ t his back pain , making a word game .
the sentence ku la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it is used to reduce radic@@ ally nation@@ alist nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic , before it is all po@@ sts to spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook is del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
this is filtering the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should be done instead , is the post carefully analy@@ zing and check it out by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age range ) .
the good is that this three @-@ leg@@ ged nation@@ alists who use Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation , receive a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their Nationalism .
while the action wants to send a strong signal to all that hate speech @-@ language , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of impact words often become a cat and mouse game , where users will simply use social networks to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he just wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new gui@@ del@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign the post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community did not say . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or who simply try to show their opinions against the talk of radi@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with speech :
post without Hass@@ elt talk by Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have had more to do in front of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
taking such words , only hatred will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
it also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt to rec@@ ti@@ fy the f@@ eit@@ ful po@@ sts .
if they were only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a large turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided a lot of sc@@ orn among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now talk about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation to see if their posts will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ po@@ sts that ab@@ stain@@ ed not an agreement , but nevertheless they have been removed :
used with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ ic text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film and watch an Indian film .
only to try if Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , the social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , speech @-@ language in social networks should also increase violence in the con@@ greg@@ ations in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area where they have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk to his bur@@ ge@@ ese pages under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of taking the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have better running , rather than in context as a code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is an end with the children of children
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s Parliament unanim@@ ously decided to offer a law that this practice is to offer , so that the marriage age is 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members passed dual and Muslim religious communities at practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the different religious groups of the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state is not to determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN children &apos;s rights convention , the min@@ ors as , , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
the statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws on the child before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped me to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before they should take care of her own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition re@@ lie@@ ve tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime sometime came in doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the kinder@@ garten - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent that contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which once again read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against the children of children was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices , and none of them decided against it .
having decided in the Senate before , the design can now become the law .
the majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws have been finally changed to the child before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a Prime Minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary nec@@ ede used to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s time is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally , and that &apos;s almost every price worth .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent News !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society , who said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now ir@@ respective of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of marriage was today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of which are present at the vote .
all members who were against were voted for the law .
the kinder@@ garten is not legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ gu@@ ing .
many thanks to all activists who have cast him out .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hindu organization of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
during the general At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was absolutely correct when Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear satellite , if we are instead of talking about the discussion so generally , in a way that we invite you to talk about the state in our bedroom , that they may make use of great , hard @-@ controlled men who are opposed to them in the advantage , would you be ready to continue discussing the discussion ?
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a court case against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children of child is legal or still the norm , though there are laws that they say .

through the reflection of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , le@@ per to the SO@@ PA ( Stop online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the United States .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month the Turkey has closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day , it is clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
although many technology sealed Internet users are used to use h@@ acking tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times ) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed in 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been sign@@ posted by regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages , which are mir@@ ro@@ red the content of Wikipedia and frequently ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
but the content is not available yet .
in a blog post reports IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to check Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step has been carried out regardless of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it &apos;s only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ve similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

you attack on another URL , which is not the original . that &apos;s what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server runs on request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia for even if these are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese game photographer uses his camera to attract attention to the need for nature protection

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
the motivated him would carry him a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar will stri@@ ve to bring Nep@@ als to the international scene .
and his home town is right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ose attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as it helps him first @-@ class location at his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested me at home when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my Father , that on the bank of Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to gain cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nepal as nature and would like to understand the understanding of that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like .
and he ought to know , because he already stood on face to face to face ,
tiger leaves out of the opinion of the sheep do not distur@@ b during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
I was also on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he is immediately going to see us , and he star@@ es me through the s@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit@@ . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to capture the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took up until he could take up a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years after the wedding , there were Indian women for the first time to talk the name of their husbands &quot; &quot; &quot;
women in the small Indian village Rub@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as a part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the names of their husbands or even older men in family .
instead , they use a p@@ ron@@ ome or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should viol@@ ate the norm to receive this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state O@@ bes@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and viol@@ ate her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relations with names .
the tradition of their wives is also not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less conditions to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , nine women , including health professionals , and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss the en@@ quiries of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss it .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , who is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets itself for the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the prohi@@ bit@@ ing of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts this clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as the pilots of the mur@@ als .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini , showed in their discussion round , acted by women who don &apos;t call their husbands at the name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
to mention the names of their husbands , a ro@@ man , whom they pleaded not guilty to all obligations , and never questioned any question .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition tells that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered extinct , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted out that we never had thought to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name until now , wanted to try at home , as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned aside to me , and said , I should name him in his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched their first discussion group .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ y , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call ourselves as they want , meaning that they should not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands more than the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women never married the names of their husbands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that , during the whole exercise , only went straight forward ; another decided to release all the stri@@ ped fru@@ stration against him and his family , by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ renal@@ ine ex@@ hil@@ ation , with an ancient bre@@ eder , the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family .
she was afraid as her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participants was less mis@@ understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as tra@@ pping of the carcin@@ ogenic red dot on the forehead , which shows the husband status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot when he got it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard him to bear him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not ceased , but my , they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him in some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women the Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion bill .
normally we have lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women who hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days for the first time in their lives with cakes . they danced and sang , talking about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties are knot@@ ted to our husbands , never so hon@@ estly .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have to talk about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have worn only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not get@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe , the mor@@ ality associated with sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair Kur@@ tas ( Upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will get it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly going into rolling :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped trying to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .

a new system of kidn@@ apping @-@ strong persons for organ commerce , probably for aber@@ ration purposes , is wor@@ rying the police from Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . now the local government called a number of operations to life to stop the practition@@ ers .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and found in the wake that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ headed man could bring gold , an old or wealth , the police pre@@ fers of the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered on top @-@ headed men in Mozambique .
another group , the objective of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South African country led a mission to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have planned to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel according to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police after the latest assassination of three strong men based on their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in Mil@@ ange , where the murdered were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ lets in the South of Mozambique said that the local police have already said :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of strong men .
the persecution and killing of strong individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural moti@@ fs and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans in custody ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exist , according to which the victims would have power in the head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha told the chron@@ icle of the blog of the blog Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique is opposite :
I would like GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ I am ashamed to demand sex against good notes , and other achievements , a nation in which the teachers would not hurt themselves , or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or less @-@ headed for aber@@ ative purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aims to aim to get quick wealth .
despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor could not be missed .

a picture of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention to the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage of the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ endanger@@ ing ) after being involved in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has referred to Li@@ us &apos;s case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a nar@@ r@@ ator , he considers it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to call views of the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , free or allow for an treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ine in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has group@@ ed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize in Liu was given to Liu , although the Norwegian Government has ha@@ sted that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations was continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed a agreement to restore the salmon crew to China since 2010 , since 2010 exports were mostly blocked .
after the message had spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for un@@ conditional release to express and invited Liu to get his price in Oslo .
due to his detention he was not able to increase his price .
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife to free himself from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also to release Li@@ us on the occasion of a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans said &quot; him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ appropriate to him in his Gen@@ es@@ ion . &quot;
an spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy gave the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the US message with@@ drew an angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to take an un@@ reasonable and ir@@ responsible remarks concerning Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom such as travel insurance and access to medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international comm@@ itments .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to imp@@ ose Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that it may cause a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support receives he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on July 7 and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources reported in Beijing from the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could su@@ stain Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide adequate medical care and allow him to give him a possibility to re@@ produce himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told me that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but police have always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada calls on China to commit its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to maintain and dis@@ closed the rights of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in an explanation on 29 June to release Liu of humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments receives , which he , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news agency has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information that France would end up .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the Council in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and establish a greater tolerance to those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature called for Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party in China also to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very concerned and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said to Liu :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took , and for whom he had been strictly punished , led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable , and weal@@ thy China , which would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , who stands for democracy , freedom and law of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a town .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during a meeting of the international branch of the international branch of the State Association of New York , the minister noted that many people have critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because it is compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a town .
... no one has questioned about whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Ministry of Justice , &quot; turning logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice , this valuable land is to be created , one will say that we could not be any country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the accus@@ ation before the responsibilities , a must @-@ hurt .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that , he was in@@ sof@@ ter un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , to be permanent from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old ser@@ er of the author@@ itative mach@@ inations , which pre@@ destined to be demo@@ cr@@ ats , abandoned logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end this was the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial authorities , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
he asked relevant questions with non @-@ answers rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point when it was paid high , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on his comment on the blog , he points out on the critics that one should start to read the entire collection of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important even if we are happy to give us free and fair elections .
he compar@@ es Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t agree in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore very well ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure whether he really believes that he really believes that he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review shows the vulner@@ ability of sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams argument :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; have committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der loser ?
if Singapore is no country , we will be considered as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back in Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally countryside and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cab@@ le@@ - , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do people make their military service , they defend only their city , but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
to conclude the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the year , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many people ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true .
we should speak rather about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ leading aspect of your residence or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which situation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his meeting partner by providing personal questions .
then the default answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in the course of anger , if they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes the Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible in their ruck@@ sack when they are travelling .
all the Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans are ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we are obviously very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
nothing would account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly , as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be sp@@ ic@@ uous , as well as the beneficial , gentle , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one of his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can cast itself .
harmless to be harmless , to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn any attention .
that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that pass around a around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a prime minister of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to care about our own affairs only .
what we describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I have joined with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au sees the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada just as sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video that seized the jun@@ ta , and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government in 2014 .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
in the first three days the video was shared on Facebook highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked to the public in Thailand after a group of activists trained to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , as special as it beha@@ ves with the position of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been di@@ li@@ ly persecuted during the last three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creation change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to re@@ lie@@ ve activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , supervised the online content and persons accused of having s@@ lander the monarchy to have been prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ward business against &quot; The Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s bur@@ ial ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed the mar@@ tial law .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continue to order is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety expert they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax @-@ funds .
in the video even as people will be thrown into a black delivery van , before they bring them into an inter@@ vening bearing , another problem fall .
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and they are accused of use of a long prison term , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the band members , who used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die tribute of Pan@@ em &quot; that was already used by put@@ sch opponents during protests 2014 .

the post @-@ war company is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ische War was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , off @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people in these vul@@ ture villages .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people came , after barely had risen above a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five floors of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ k@@ ovo , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally known for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
it &apos;s still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens which served all of the community .
now there is only a paved road with amazing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place , and their contribution to the central plan@@ ation of the Soviet Union , have abandoned the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek , who still have one or two families , one recogni@@ zes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discovered me with the camera in his hand , they immediately draw back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother prohibited us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sid@@ y economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district management supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jazeera .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she is supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do that - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembers the Dor@@ mit@@ es before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Europe , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will take something , &quot; she explains re@@ um@@ erable .
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was found , they hold pigs , cows , rabbits and chickens .
she tells that there was a very frigh@@ tening situation initially , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have a fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden himself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , then rolling the hill .
a group of children is now writing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw at the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for un@@ belief in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa is home &quot; migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 at the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral pink Bri@@ ll@@ n base and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ ble walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons .
they don &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs that they can not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that drew from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ án ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ry ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ án travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other sign@@ posts of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already talk on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his departure director Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests are often sending text messages when they have gone to greet them or tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l @-@ end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants are included in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a kitchen place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , and other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to get money from him , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ one , has offered it its roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the gears , trav@@ ellers consult their phones .
today , a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she p@@ onder@@ s her album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she introduces them short .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ gi@@ sts , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the town of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification where the district government indicates , to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will allow access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities will also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app with a private We@@ chat group .
in the release of the police , the app revealed the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ am , Trojan , and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend on online and to control your own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these features can be used naturally in a diverse manner .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal out .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , th@@ ron@@ ged ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict regions , the authorities often arrange extreme it@@ ens@@ ors and security measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet shut@@ downs .
the photographs based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( which were the regular news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were checking the residents to check out whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile message asked that people are installing the app within 10 days .
if you can be discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the cover technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( the regular stop of the regular intervals ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up the license requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize circulation of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office for the operation of their computers and communication equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , up to August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate some &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible publishers , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and performing that you are all alone at one place where everything is important .
everything has come to and dis@@ band@@ ed and reveal a truth that is clearly visible , both from inside and from the outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one that has settled in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality takes you again and you are behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and actors - the characters transform themselves from flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is on the axis of un@@ true . you will clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone was erected here .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson &quot; as the leader of the security services - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he put his power over us by evidence of destroying even the easiest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn apart during a peaceful protest , as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to divide the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all city districts cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , rain @-@ free , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a city , which is allocated to the arter@@ ies with state safety @-@ organisms and their ac@@ complic@@ es .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down something , after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence , taking several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence re@@ vil@@ ed .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends shut up with me ; we came to a pra@@ g@@ able picture that filled my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the barley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice , after you took the whole way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you cry to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dream of what to look for me in the eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps to the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I have never stopped seeing you into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and I don &apos;t regret my word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to it . &quot;
the confes@@ sion of this curse lies to me in the nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a certain torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cry the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
afterwards by the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I get all the details exactly before I cared for the space .
unlike else , they probably allocated a bigger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoners and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a couple of minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I hold back on a proven communication method : to beat the wall with your fist .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ain@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he said to me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man @-@ aged old age , which seems to be similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers can be connected with its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would be joy@@ ful if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I always convinced that black the colour of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light that took us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; recording on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret to protect the state security before us and prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ wi@@ ki dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational map and locked the close view of their world@@ view .
this is no house , which is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I care for the listening room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start to join this tape and to protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I don &apos;t answer .
I have used to answer it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and strokes after a friendly conversation has become a ordinary communication agent .
when and how it happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to be acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to be punished , although I had nothing done to deserve this sentence .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear down so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the monastery .
your Hen@@ ker turned to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry .
my cry did not come to him yet , so that they ex@@ ed the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cable inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour , three of them have changed from them while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and even my voice , why I heard it out .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and found no favor in it , which is why it is the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole @-@ quarter .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power supply .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went in , who came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning bet .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ ch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful troubles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go away , you will be re@@ located . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !

H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry eter of the second generation &quot; - so he himself describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with the protest against Islam .
basically , the strokes of the warm coffee and the wa@@ xes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes it feels like a prison under the sky , especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the Ram@@ ad@@ an water to drink - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior of Jordan has canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
a few par@@ liament@@ arians , who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert review .
the MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; just &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary .
many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like Arab spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila inv@@ al@@ armed the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be a rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan reflect that in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly occurs .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sexually ch@@ oral care to body by made his vision of the fate of Arabic women who made vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently un@@ worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of them they should have confidence .
during the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , there is still frigh@@ tening that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women , victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for frag@@ ile control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of internal famili@@ al violence , &quot; must be held on in@@ definite period in prison , &quot; and for their release , often a years of bureaucra@@ tic expendi@@ tures , as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for that , even before the themes , that in his country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b denied that his work is political , however , that he sees his music that is full of explic@@ it play@@ outs on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &quot; ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focuses on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want &quot; - is it faith or non @-@ faith , het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context , rot@@ ated and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without car@@ vings , but he was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still stuck thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why do Jord@@ anians do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ asch@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they had comments on comments in social media critical to the problems related to deeply ro@@ oted in the country .
given that , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion is just the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to take a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anians .
for him , progress is a permanent link and take a show for him . Jordan has managed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks quite sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately h@@ d@@ ai@@ b dre@@ amt such as millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he is not only dreams of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them that &quot; they are experiencing . &quot;
perhaps the region is recognized by music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions and artificial way . at least he hopes that .
until the time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and thus also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is presum@@ ed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of the T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums , the drums and dancing over one thousand years , and from a time come , in the troops of Japan in the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ t@@ l .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fort@@ resses are straight ahead .
nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival the only tru@@ e - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the North of the country .
I was here and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fixed car was unbelievable .
let us enjoy the rest of summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdres@@ ser &apos;s hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbor , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug dealers are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the more nor@@ ms to the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers who can re@@ lie@@ ve this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other in order to show who can create the ex@@ cent@@ rist L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational establishments like the Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hairdres@@ ser &apos;s tools and instead of bad advice to get an apprentic@@ eship in hairdres@@ ser &apos;s art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offering options , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March before starting in March and reported some of her successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist in the community and the district where we are very proud , because of our children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighting
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; love messages to guer@@ ri@@ llas , &quot; which has published an international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this entry is published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel out@@ stretched , aff@@ ection to it ?
this question was exactly the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconc@@ ile ) , the young people encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ lla &apos;s letters .
only recently , her country was the scene of an historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signat@@ ory of the peace agreement was so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize .
before the column of Colombia , however , there is a long way until one can speak of an effective reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ak@@ oos , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a rh@@ et@@ oric of war and , around the clock , have to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against guer@@ ri@@ llas , it must now take in their ranks and support them with a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young column has to close together and would have to help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages sent to former guer@@ ri@@ llas to welcome them again in society .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighting - which should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the man that we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much needed .
he plane , he told her to share his love with people this year , that needed most of the most urgent assistance .
so , the plan was created , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that somebody would be forgiven &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the region of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to manage the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC , as they had done earlier , to increase the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive instructions , but letters full of sub@@ ordin@@ ating people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; told the political knowledge of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter made me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a type of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas are living ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla who wrote something .
I was afraid to go back , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ate , a le@@ thal weapon in the bush .
and I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply for a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never ever in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears across the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were grown up and grew up as a war and the F@@ ARC was already hidden in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC became the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insights into its views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how to develop the social in@@ justice by the state on the whole Colom@@ bian people , we can contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people have never heard that they had never found hearing , and to recognize that people who often have seen as a monster , and even hated even people with beautiful emotions , who were turned around through their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me .
but it comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and have done so much harm to bring us something and give a smile and hug .
many former fighter answers to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ nist was made aware that after the dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to lift up the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we now rely on peace with the F@@ ARC on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ ender of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to all of those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , afford our contribution and bringing sacrifices , because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple . to those who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be imp@@ ending .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ row

this follows the translation of an article which was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and its first publication on the OC Media website .
homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
in terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only ar@@ isen about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic .
LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines in several months after reports that have been published , killing torture and killing of que@@ ens in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took a susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and took them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a transaction , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she went to Moscow .
after a group of Cher@@ ry was experienced by gender equality , the hunt for Sabrina was opened .
fear of her life moved her last final in the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a transaction that was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone , from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole What@@ s@@ App turn round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was doing just a few shopping bag from the back seat of my car I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you by your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt some in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard another set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you swal@@ low ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently , some women had to get everything and started scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a nurse .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ance were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name . but the doctor stood up and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats from the last February .
they call me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family has visited by neighbors and some distant relations .
they called to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they set wei@@ rd demands : some said me , I have to prove it , I must prove it up without the streets ; others wanted me to tre@@ ad up in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only evil @-@ speaking , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke even my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she took a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily , the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dark@@ ened window of window and a license plate with a 95 .
after the third time it happened , I realized that something was la@@ zy .
my traff@@ ick@@ ers friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible .
I still cannot compreh@@ end how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother soon as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without register , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I checked the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you are in safety , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you see . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about sexual intercourse , however , that is a table theme .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements I still bear in myself .
as much as I wish I can &apos;t overcome this se@@ el@@ ian barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
if we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble as the person remembers them - so that it reminds of my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ ees ?
Sabrina : I have filed a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait for the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
with this , I would probably invite their relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it would not be very many .
if , especially those who have no rich relations , or those of their relatives have been abandoned to place Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that one can present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but targeted targeted to radic@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this now a assumption , or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard was grown .
there have been nothing new since them .
they simply have taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved when these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports . we assume that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed to shave this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings are of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I had never had any problems .
in the serious !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to come back to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were wi@@ ped ; I had painted eyelashes , bore tubes and short tops .
the security Ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ em : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ote is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children , if it &apos;s fun to be fun .
OC Media : so they just have her eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace time do ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als in television .
he did not tell us about us , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change .
he who killed before and laugh@@ ed at once , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily .
OC Media : what activity is you going to go right now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I didn &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US .
apart from that , I am still working as an activist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ ed with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I gra@@ ze them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I cli@@ pped a flu@@ ori@@ der .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Cher@@ et@@ sch@@ ens who want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay men with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans , who , the Kab@@ ard@@ ine , have those who have Russians also , on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
do you know , many think about Transi@@ tional identity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a dec@@ eiver .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I know that I myself am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 came out the desper@@ ate situation of Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi fellowship in Iran that is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sto@@ oped down for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , which can come up to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s human rights groups would like to remain in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video took the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people make it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ram hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources , according to local sources , were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide in which in August , within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists say on site that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights stated that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have caught up .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers that felt due to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and un@@ fit to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of the Arab people living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livel@@ ihood .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the upcoming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influential and precious farm areas of the Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and dis@@ car@@ ing .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Ara@@ bians systematically work@@ stations in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of tribes , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are lying .
these ro@@ dents have only led to destroy devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the local and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who seek a job to complete the primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ azi Human Rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ ality among young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic people and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
because officials and institutions don &apos;t prefer to set Arabian workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s access to work in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make it to earn their living outside of their homeland ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to hide their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the ancest@@ ral azi , and so called Arab names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , because the speech of the Arabic language or the tra@@ iling of Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer , human rights activists need alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and knowing it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I uni@@ fy me with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions came to an expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they are wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money , despite the same formation as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to make things up with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women face sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass covering , and that discrimination based on gender is still cross@@ wise through the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk to skin color , on rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , on black females in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q commune or in black women from di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , as we have always been mis@@ used under rac@@ ism , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
however , all agree that women - all women should come together to get &quot; their voices and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , an institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which are exposed to black women on two times .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and origin of origin fewer earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds more often the school are rejected than white girls , due to apparent integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ amm@@ ar and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women , all men and all human beings who have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre the white woman likes to take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which relate to both gender as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will not be able to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ istic @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ be@@ ner compl@@ ained of 1851 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to justify an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature .
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bs our customs and customs to absorb their eg@@ o@@ zent@@ ish program .
I will not try to try white women to determine the importance of over@@ cutting skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to revi@@ ve them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different approaches to be a home and from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to get rid of me full of femin@@ ism and to join me on the movement of Wom@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of a white @-@ feminist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born to be celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism , says that we can defend ourselves towards our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be admi@@ red by the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately be called Separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life does not survive , nor igno@@ res nor is rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ights against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
ever again Nabil Mus@@ a traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who declares his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river which we had lost than I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of st@@ ains , pollution , and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is involved and working to protect &quot; the rivers , streams , and water paths in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia von Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq @-@ based documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multimedia journalist .

c@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women presents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the mor@@ mor@@ ality in the country and in the region and show their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter ) who reports over the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
a police Com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had been violent to violent .
since the end of her relationship had been a little time , and the police said , their statement would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena revealed for abuse of abuse , the ac@@ ten@@ acious advertisement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not profitable .
a few days later , the second woman moved back her ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women appear at all once , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence in the law en@@ forcement authorities .
In@@ spec@@ 1 Sm@@ ur@@ king and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ sions and a legal system that doesn &apos;t inter@@ rup@@ tible 3 of the laws : good approach , lack of implementation stripes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that show not even ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General Assembly received 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went on violence against women .
86 % of ads found in the police were women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence against the peac@@ ekeeping forces . 86 % of the women &apos;s ads came here .
in these ads , 40 % of women said they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics show , however , not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ erial Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not one of his own crimes , the prosecution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of female murders in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violent men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she was going to repent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most severe recogni@@ zable :
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that the only women had happened to be sub@@ mis@@ led , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mariana us@@ eless social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without names , they wrote posts on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos herself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked why they had fallen so long from Carlos , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse are at least a certain complic@@ ity to it .
Victoria Santos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listening to each other and supporting each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner , finally , managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without the result and even by their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against their former partner who developed into an un@@ break@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland in which it mainly went around money , power , and the influence of their former partner .
ays of laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applicable .
the ad@@ diction of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , looks also great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Princip@@ al ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain Fem@@ ale d to an independent offen@@ ders and harder to pun@@ ish like it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature was altered in some points to win the members of the Law , who feared the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and are sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was provided , most of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) travel costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present even if they just want to receive a safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources available :
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part of human relationships .
there must be a re@@ thinking , that violence is no longer considered a little nor@@ ms .
those who keep in view of this facts , is guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to restore so long ad , until abuse is not considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 the law of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted . before , parts of the law had been changed , however , among others , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the law is considered a great blow . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked because of a decision of the information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is allowed to read Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and tried before the court , but returned again later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 , after he had depos@@ ited his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence , chief commander of the armed forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic intelligence , public liberties , including press freedom , limit and human rights defended , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the authorities clos@@ ets peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , remember to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which since its foundation in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , with the title &quot; High @-@ level Parties &quot; into the law on 26 July 2016 . in this case , it was about corruption in the pyramid and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high ranking parties hold hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a member of the editorial committee , was charged with the special department and was arrested at his arrival of the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS chief editor , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was arrested as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the Information Minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on all roads , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first hearing was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , an annual professional ban on the two journalists was forced .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after completing the use of &quot; an Information Network on the spread of material that could represent a danger to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a b@@ ail was set up in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ al Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and sentenced Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence in prison .
the Court of Appe@@ als also appe@@ aled the decision of the Ministry of Education , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper , according to what was exposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Information Committee issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister is personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended by three additional months , with which the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press was injured in Oman at the latest time .
such injuries include , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire their operation .
due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the investment freedom of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protecting the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ ending and journalists in Oman should imp@@ ose their right human rights work without fear and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights of human rights ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent countries through the promotion of freedom and associations , as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his understanding
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health care , many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a wide problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , helps establish its own research capacities in Africa . greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he worked on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
moreover , I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion of important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects will be varied well .
it is difficult to find people who want to return or move here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory materials is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need of special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the space , the healthcare ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that perio@@ dic@@ als make items accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) is also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solv@@ ents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred for the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant grown by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been eaten .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only given by his own acc@@ ru@@ sion and the question how many salads can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 2006 he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further on breeding .
the patents are not only available for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green leaf@@ y leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . because of this trends , plant breeding , environmental prot@@ ector , and experts for food security ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on always serves salad , but he has no longer needed to continue his work with more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a rock falls in a river , in order to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents will go to far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed any more new salads , because all of the characteristics are already patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tried to breed the characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is increasingly important in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse @-@ house &quot; of the station far@@ med and eaten . there we have been tested if plants are grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was created in life to ensure that some plant species and are not protected as intellectual property , and permanently used for plant bre@@ e@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eder can under@@ take a commitment to use that other seeds are able to use far@@ med seeds .
this does not mean , however , that in their seed do not continue to do business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can only allow others to breed it to cross their own varieties , and it is not immediately prohibited - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seeds and the possibility to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to cut the latter not or only little to breed seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ec@@ ologically farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , as it is likely to buy good , local and sustainable producing vegetables as it is expected to grow on farmers markets , should also know that the species is far@@ med up , like this vegetable is threatened .
nutrition sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to others , to make other seeds still freely available . so , contrary to this , their predi@@ sposition is to be patented , seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available geni@@ ous due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant materials , which therefore always be restricted , un@@ ce@@ asing .
Claire Lu@@ by , the director of O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rot and their availability . she found that about a third of all cart@@ ing features are protected as intellectual property , which is not even usable for plant bre@@ e@@ ders either .
for other plants there are not estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ sized plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are produced so far@@ med that they are targeted targeted , such as such as their taste or their color , to such , due to them in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for bre@@ eder can be derived by ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently more than ever before , since the changing conditions are worse predic@@ table by climate change .
in an email , Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ itation activities . with a total of four genre banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States , the company is responsible for the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it does contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property can handle other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variety of innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can follow each other as soon as the patent has expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result .
such protection , therefore , does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by using the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent strap , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general good and also should remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their work easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
altogether , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es along with the concept of creating plant features : &quot; we are not creating the features .
the plants constitute themselves out and as bre@@ eder we have finally no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; those who pose a variety , also ch@@ ill his own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed to be required for their cultivation . rub@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed to breed in its varieties of this concept of farming .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents , it will create most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patented or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in its breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder is innovative by avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ents of innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years even , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it &apos;s been protected for 20 years before competition , with which it simply makes my opinion quite beautiful . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
while the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; licence , which ultimately is an informal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from land to land , absent for the O@@ ss@@ i obligation to be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional ch@@ aired plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks to the present practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents for conventional ch@@ ased plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is now the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards frag@@ ility of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled next year of the official starting signal .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published global Alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have the possibility to exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be recognised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially considered , where and as something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clear the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Collec@@ tible in spite of this attack and the failure of the Egyptian Law and the constitution to defend this goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the lock and do not pursue it . we hope to keep our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network in Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the shaft of the website . @ an@@ hr@@ i received one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights advoc@@ ates Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of colum@@ nist and articles that he has no accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now , the blog , which he established to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s apparatus , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and took a video like police physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly turn around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada out@@ lined the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the to un@@ lock blogs is very old but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege condition ; an arrest , an attempted murder , loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have shown that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after having locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 websites . this revealed technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , by changing Internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we saw how the blocking of websites , which offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began .
such practice suggests that the government &apos;s intention is to block and filtering content to access the Egyptian users .
the situation is caused by this , in addition , that the c@@ ens@@ ing decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it may lead before the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second biggest city of the country and home of several postcards .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ eps himself killed a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves screw@@ ed Phar@@ macy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a split financial situation , the violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation of Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , is published by the civili@@ zed standard and what is only in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative so we do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , said that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explained that there are 8@@ 43 areas according to the Institute &apos;s Internal Security Council , which will be controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes further :
we are aware that a war course , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , Gr@@ ass@@ am@@ ity of the police , which only shoot and then ask questions , to extingu@@ ish .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
in an article on the News portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argued that violence as &quot; war . &quot; this would be difficult to have a jus@@ tification of failed safety policy by the media and could make it harder to rule the responsibility of the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historic and self @-@ counterfeit neg@@ lect of the public service .
for memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as the &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong with C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
no one of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio is located on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra is the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia is stressed , has repeated the Security Policy of the State for years .
to these security policies , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela of a massive police unit and station@@ ed a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP took part in several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under guard .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Charle@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria of the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for the people .
for this calls on the state , resources and paths which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ment &quot; and &quot; conce@@ aled bul@@ lets . &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continues to suffer .
one week it is now that the police force the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to assass@@ inate the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident made headlines : an or@@ chard died due to shots taken by the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the research organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
especially heavily affected is the East G@@ hou@@ ta region where an attack with chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these from the rebels controlled territories outside of Damascus stood under siege , which led the inhabitants on a local or caused by tunnel and control points .
by the years of years , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ balance , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to conventional , plant@@ ing in Syria and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years ago to announce this project and pushed out his relief that it is now more and more . &quot;

Portu@@ ges@@ e demand justice for the victims of the Br@@ ings of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many neighbour@@ hoods of Portugal on 21 October in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that ra@@ ined in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the region Gal@@ icia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country , spread about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured parties in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitored the forest area by satellite photos , in 2017 alone there are about 500,000 hectares of forest alone - an area of the area &apos;s size in Lisbon alone .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there are only 4 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s no fire .

numerous videos are spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the ab@@ sc@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to en@@ force the extent of tragedy so far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits are stored in est@@ rt@@ ati@@ ties with a high fire risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ sufficient suggestion for the wal@@ low form that the government had launched after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , came from the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstac@@ le to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law allowed to prevent the construction activity on funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carries João Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees from light combus@@ tible wood , turned out to spread as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this species .
to these problems , however , that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people were looking for information or attempted to contact members , were offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time via the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched by the developer João P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October so that the servers were sending the 400,000 users who followed the fires , did not with@@ stand the web site more than half a million requests .

the Path of refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
just at this time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son very long - maybe even more .
the boy was to break up in the morning gray .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the locks .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly had a lot of protection .
the Taliban were getting near@@ er for their hate to the Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left out of his small wages , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to earn his life .
back then , like today , the lives of Afghan refugees were shaped by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon before the open windows , so that we don &apos;t get fr@@ ying at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran behind and made ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af left homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that was distributed twice on the day food in need .
true , it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that seek asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special admission centers . it is a impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission center if they officially declared a request for asylum - which can still go for asylum after the registration of asylum .
by then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ unk@@ y lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after several years working in construction industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af spent his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a sn@@ ail .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story Beh@@ ind the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for credits are only some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan developed companies , among them tail@@ ers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience , where the Kell@@ ner and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome , also Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian restaurants and retail trade and aim to go back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forgot my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers in the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest o@@ vers@@ ations on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan on this path .
citizen report : bills of Egypt allow social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in custody .
he reported on the clearance of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that fore@@ sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority .
users would have to use to use social networks within six months following the authority of the authority on the authority of their full name and ID number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the end of a criminal complaint .
the law , which was recruited by sixty par@@ liament@@ arians , is currently present to the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the deputy was given a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the har@@ dening of the President or a high civil servants would be introduced .
under Egyptian Law , the extension of the President as well as state institutions are already fir@@ med . however , under the legislative proposal , a such act would act with prison and pur@@ pen@@ alties , legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the convicted .
moreover , this would under@@ take a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom in danger has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud &apos;s subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 while demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators , demonstr@@ ating against the military coup that led to the minister of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protests , who had been arrested by the same incident , four years in detention at a trial date .
recently , his trial was moved on 20 May , because the jail line of human rights groups were failed to bring the def@@ endants from the prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , such as weapons ownership , illegal meeting , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the crimes of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ n@@ ical activists re@@ li@@ stens to sk@@ ill@@ ful documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is primarily supported by the President of the Republic , which is explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , which was explicitly promised by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption of accused Am@@ nesty law , provided that all of them would be legally binding .
this document published on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , throws a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ cal plans look forward to the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press complex , which aims to secure the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness .
will China force the users to force social media to submit their reference ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media require a approval before they write messages in social media .
in the regulations , it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suggest that by the Eli@@ min@@ ation of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks , it is still un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese power citizens have proposed that regulations have been proposed to protect these regulations in order to protect the journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia dis@@ closed access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed white chat , to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services , which allows the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites currently belong to websites like V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ .@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .

the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked , the site has been locked because they collabor@@ ated to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to attack a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
