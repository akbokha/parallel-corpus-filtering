<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have danced with American music, American authors, and operated with his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such an amazingly profound effect on me, that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magistrate, who wanted to occupy his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after method Man, "I was" s, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration had only been strengthened for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are, and it is easily acceptance in a community of conspinned people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shameful love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its ascension is for me, as he continues with its narrow-minded men.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops the mountain with his opinion, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks he was a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party's presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these biglot person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get Trump and his voters to get in harmony with people, which I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic programme, the people from all over the world, a deep glar person, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps does not agree with the present editor of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see "Phoenix Suns" at the play.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I struggled with Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits in the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were still Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embodied values deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump led his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The dispute with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either had his racism and fanatismus, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the trump-voters to describe as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about hectic changes will not be taken into account in their churches.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom are the most white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she disapot?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whelyash" "" "(20 m.: as much as" "" "white vs. all other ethnicities" "" "; word game from white in connection to the White and Whiplash, as it means the big Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether Myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you always have, America is welcome to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country selected as his president, twice the son of an Kenianers, whose story himself says, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of white America's promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the rowing, say they.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan said.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" swears the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if anyone who doesn't like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new US.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">Out of the misery to the stars: these Latin American children can't destroy their love for music.</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only changed the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity for the transgression of the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English paper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental meeting with a French pilots who launched a musical project and made the youth so rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on the instruments which are made from recyclable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments, made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio Chávez started to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitated violins, violins, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the starting time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same point where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced by trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landscapes Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world is produced every year about a billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landscapes Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that is fighting wild fisheries.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication is within the context of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset up and slightly inclined, a bill of that kind in their coastlines are welcome.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compores, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that you just refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishery authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship of the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries in 2012 by the NRO stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">Besides Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equally conspinned and work together. you can exchange information and stand in each other when it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts, Ending illegal fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to trace. this is illegal fishing a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are supposed to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing was hammered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the screw-empo, with the information between different countries, the actions nowadays occur in real time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange, e.g., lists of existing licences, news to suspicious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to characterize ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing companies can then refuse the assumption of such ships in their harbours, which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo, and that they may even be forced to pay for the numbers of crimes, as in the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant, which is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated $20 million in lost revenues, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among these practices, among other things, are like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indicating Phantasienames, the fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system" "", "says Long." "" "a ship was illegally fishing and a country could then say 'you mustn't run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and precisely this legal conclusion is trying to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed against criminal networks that have been distributing licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority on combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organized crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is always developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships that hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off, for example, their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it is said to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team from African nations can actually influence global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch to the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite data and can be shown worldwide by the position of each of the traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of what where does - this makes it simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project to run at which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also cut off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously confiscated without license, and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i countries now have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since then fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object in West Africa to disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined the West Africa Task Force, as well as they fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "with safety, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member states could report its first big triumph in October: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used with trappnets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still stuck in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the Take of measurement rules against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they should go against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such special, collaborative work is actually working within the world ocean. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the Environment, Technology and Nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was released on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, a Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now as an adult, he said Quijano in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano didn't choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed in the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then, I thought that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one cannot notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not realize that my father was a thief, an older and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence service 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who witnessed the extent of atrocities over the years, which he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Bundesgericht against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child, and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a asshole, you were friends with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait for the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in which cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little wrap in a ceiling and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that a large clump was silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and underlined me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There are tortured prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="238">I jumped in and saw a song that were tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a dirt bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget that smell.</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man and killed there.</seg>

<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a complicity in this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay me to load what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you thought during the dictatorship of humans, but what the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children deduce?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl with her home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not even families who could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhous act you can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they used machinery to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older car drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are not involved in accidents.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were produced by seniors in 2005, representing a total of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is case in the case of native language. generally, the belief that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - the native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way, a French native language is to translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ a staff with English as a native language, which could be translations into English. this may lack understanding for overtaking, cost-engined or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees don't have to make translations. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, to be translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distorted and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation, show that this technology can not replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulas in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for clist reasons - not to read or understood even.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but of great companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city uses hopefully a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family, with little money, gives her minders. son or her minderyear daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for that countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse are - and all that can't rise in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This is described as Criadazgo practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">Following her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness, relief and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, as the feeling of gratitude to be vaccinated the criaditas, guaranteed in general.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came into the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of heavy strokes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former military agency Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a official member of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in their home in Vaquería, a small village located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed as long as with a stick to Marín, until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of young girls.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>

<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the paraguayan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest against protest and demanded that there were no more Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all working and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the home of their employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">So she had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">They stood up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, she cleanses the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and destiring the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently ordered a bill to "agreed Regulations about the use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is assumed by Parliament, users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">It would then be set up on the basis of the law that it is commissioned to share social media, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the assumption of the law, users would have to register in the site with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs on the internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video files and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set to pass, as the draft is supposed to be imposed, as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be able to impose users who do not register before the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary and supporter of the law firm, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come by the firewall that blocked Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary to submit information to their identity, to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans consist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technics (in German "Senior Research Committee") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly in the technical capacity and understanding. neither authority in Egypt have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they could control non-violent public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens, who apply a authorization, or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to lead them to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">To be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military monument in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that there is no deviating narration on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the member of the Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative position against cyber crime in which a lifelong sentence for those who had been found guilty to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the veterans Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq have to protect the ambition of Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the leopards of leopards that are in Africa and Asia are among the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">How Raza shows up in the video, "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. when the team has therefore established that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionate about another site of their country, who does not only consist of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March, 2017, the progress made for the North-East Japan newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the "three-fold catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a local prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Iwate were killed, because the tsunami had to disappear entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress of six years after that, in order to rebuild the life-based life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses (of the regular slaughtering, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to list the greatest success among the three prefectures, with 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is at 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfswald (the first instance, casusu juutaku) to settle in definitive spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After three-fold disaster, nearly 80 000 people looked forced to live in Behelfswald.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such a rule.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, almost 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation of evacuated by the disaster in bondage were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">According to the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune, will open their doors until December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishing ports are re-commissioned in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have undergone extensively.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fukushima, lying in the "nuclear war zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered again, but also here Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent in the same state as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can be only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native people being prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuation. they asked them about the state of rebuilding and also, as their empowerment has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native people in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the local population, measures taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in disasters prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who were evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the location of evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima had also been a witness of the worst, disaster caused, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, had been resettled to permanent submares.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas most of the evacuation, which are still in Behelfshausen, is more than 50 years old. they have to compete in proper heating, because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima had to compete with massive construction projects. this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences initially seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one recognizes that more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, extend our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get fewer attention when they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the common practice of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman talks about the time she worked in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about the time she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday and put it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local picture journalist Luiz da Luz made photos from the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, there is also the face of the police officer, which was identified with a stroke stock. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service.</seg>

<seg id="603">Would be a police officer of a protesters and landing on the intensive care station, would be able to see his face for six months on TV and the entire suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Disnealizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided by Luiz da Luz recorded video on the web in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officers and several paramedits shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the bottom shown below, one sees the attack on sailor from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state of State, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to remain part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Goiânia, while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father because he was sabotaged the Occupy Movement in Secondary School. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked on the intensive care station after being attacked by a policeman that struck him with a whip on his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police in the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen set up protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had built a stage for speakers, rubber-molding and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">S & D member of Flavio Serafini, social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This is also a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media are protesting, the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo told specifically about a cerebral glass window to illustrate the image of their cover pages.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba opens the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Municipality Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - unknown, regardless of the fact that there is no notable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes a day to factories that grind still.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldatenveteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane is not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds me of having heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would not be kept, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarcane industry already resistance the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, Ineffefficiency, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality looked even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The refining of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly more competitive they were incurable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar ranges between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO report, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "the day of today's day will go down to history," "" "Fidel Castro's first words during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane factories, over 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugarcane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents have the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first time year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, the addsat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could recover any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-run factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money," assures them.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved with his will at the disclosure of the factory, where the construction of it helped, helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important workstation was erased out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the employment and services provided by the plants in the municipalities in which they were, created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the former President in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that they were not in operation for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things are changing, but not always for better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane made, or better, when they began to stop them, they also stopped to aspherate the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to find other factories.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young Nations communities in the whole Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do not do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, mobile recording studios have been working directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and operated in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will rise so that the young participants in our conversations such as "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self-acceptable" or whatever they will come into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actor.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells example the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears", a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mainly indigenous young women were killed or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important to the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">They received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who, with them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookside of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcript, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't ever care for me</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "" "" "but I'm trying to go on earth for my days." ""</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you'll get to our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do that, for which it is determined by the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of each restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly will be on the menu, will be found near the entrances shokuhin sanpuru (of the least, "plasma models of the dishes") from every food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usual they do not even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into current mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on special sales: new with plastic strained mobile tapes, such as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shot refrigerators for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences will become increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular travel with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part in the Tokyo Station's exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which keep your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight to coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own art work. in this case, ikura or salmon cheated, a popular topping with white rice is served.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can betray my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of meltless ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore there are rice balls (onigiri), earrings and leybdeners from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skinned plastic dishes can be viewed under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 2 of the regular exercise.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to exposure to the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="746">"for the victims of fighting against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico, the mischief and rubella regularly appeared in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Kartells, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the dream or to the congregations that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind each bone, in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of zahlloser parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político is the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug dealers") to live this victims, and stories of people are told by the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives changed") tells stories about these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is seeking secret tombs according to his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father to only one day her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priest:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task, which we have asked us to go away and to tombs, after the people we loved to seek." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"" "on October 15 he should return again, but he never returned" "" "Emma Veleta:" "" "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship." ""</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father's insurance, but she doesn't pay her out because they demand a death client.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who seek fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and state management.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal Político, wrote this entry from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Illness and sensations journalism do I know for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I have passed every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminals and experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal or look at this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he's great. and it's not normal that people will hear songs about the "heroic" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is what would they have lost to those who have lost someone and those who fear them so much.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories are to bloom numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of mankind is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is thus justified that they were" "" "located" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to say that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months" expressing in the main city district: as a family with threats of threats, it describes how armed criminals were destroyed for month money from their business, until they were not only destroyed the business, but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, trauma remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kill or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, if you would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to teach himself, how to make a egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live with them.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a past car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings after the civil security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecution was 3103 Morde. this equates to an average of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in view of the headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político is created in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers that has tortured the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Viking (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages to which he uses, include pictures on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to expose a rumor, or to expose a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time appeared? content in social media, no matter whether or true, tends to be continued.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us assume this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been completely misleading, used tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But there are questions about our desire to do in pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker stroked the place Sange in the East of the DR Congo, kippte round and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and thereby devastated. the streets in the region have become a dangerous pile of impact holes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, tanker fell victim to the victim of the tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses including a cinemas near, which was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses violate and stolen corpses in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to their divinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident make the grey scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows ranks of the hollow body, which are rounded up on the floor while they look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been drafted several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but may not be attributed to the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye-witnesses reported drastically reduced by atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "the numbers could not be confirmed," "" "no one stayed back to count bodies," "" "said a population of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite imagery could be illustrated by the follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again as the evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this mischievous use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure issues; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further bring personal comments such as this example falsely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange was also linked to the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and some dead, some were killed by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against Rohingya, Posts reported as the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidic-Arabian news page, which said in 2012, who participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims in 2012. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to create this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of these false kiss goes back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted photo search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 at 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images, which are very similar to the discussed picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixer, private sites, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein took place in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by Boko Haram, published by the right-standing news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly explained that the picture is not from the killings, but it claims that it was a "similar war jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were alleged in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathed as proof of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages that were associated with no religious context were picked up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was supposed to have been written by a "Fr Juan Carlos Martos" over the Nigerian massacre resulted in circulation, and translated discussion forums such as this in Vietnamese and declared it to the falsehood.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that passes these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in relation to the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - in defence of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. it is therefore worthwhile to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens when reading these images can no longer be able to give faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are some people who have unintended for the share of practicing the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted it the real atrocity of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the receding of images of a turntable comes to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures even require of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern is that violent images are readers, and spectators destize and their ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which instruct how violent media act on it to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss violent representations in the news media, fact is fact that they are essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimented with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you are thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture suggests a little suggests, which can actually be used in context or completely missive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any inquiry into false statements, however, should also be considered as internationally as they can.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo of Andy Simmons was used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. unmistakable) tries to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in any language: they express some situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unnecessary words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brake).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists stubbornly every attempt to a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full statement and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected in an online list all the time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the VAT of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba your parents in recognition of what we have spent in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness you feel after being caught in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words:</seg>
<seg id="956">They entails other cultures, reveal other minds, and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you can influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish and show more of this "unmistakable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages" who are very appreciated by untranslatable are invited to invite their favorite spots here.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We must imagine even uncomfortable questions, as well as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we have no president in which we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already bombed countries and "to other handmade" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It begins with all of us.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an option, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about an other initiative by Steven Bird, the invalable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written in the written word but on the spoken word. it is a try to preserve the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to those born children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities which accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don't have to forget to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening is often linked to understand," these events are instead "listening to" how to appreciate, to feel to touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story initially in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their display lead to it that the listeners will enforce on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou considers the opportunity to explain the common customs of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara told the beak from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fives, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grinism he shares his feeling of what is said:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can be in contact with TLS in order to organize their own storyteller.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the United States of Neufestation of State debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-review of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march was launched at the puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the group "Frenchadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizenship for the neural examination of the debt) and the Ökomenian Church in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">"" "" "" "the principality of the debt of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians, benchmen and government agencies, who are responsible for debt, shall be considered for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand an financial audit and a tap committee without personal interests to the public debt, with a firm, our working conditions attached to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be prespressive and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking deposits.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the United States of State, suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an independent non-profit organization with a focus on socioeconomic development, a law responsible for state responsibility as an alternative to the existing statute view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">From the outside, measures imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens are threatened by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Doctors' finished books within three to five days, shot excerpts from the book cost of Freedom: a Collective Insignia (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and is available here. includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wishes to be built, like movements for free knowledge, and what the true costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and make some sense from our different experience.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted in the Adra prison directory, which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us can begin to reflect on their own fates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been detained in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to the Adra-prison, a non-military decor, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken hold of his cell's military court in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that, on November 12, 2015, she contacted themselves as the insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge from a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in bringing access to the Internet and to make public access to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently passes the Director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of Bassel's cultural prototypes, looking for the work that he started working with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of numerous civilians and here the Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS it all would go on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archaeology and preservation has created a time-capsule which will be invaluable to the public and for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my overall life with that, of freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other things to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He gave me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others, how they use computers, at least in theory, without having actually held their hands in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a Proven Diary, which she wrote in prison in 2012 by 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smashed the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Accounting for Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book by Nora titled "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I reconcile in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, armchairs and guard</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crushing of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I went in every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I carry with passion for myself,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes are saying,</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes away, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage's monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime's Bashar al-Assads, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65.000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted Director of custody for detention again</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption, where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state machine, which was committed to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">There are Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and detained with four other defendants in 2010 and sentenced to 22 million meticulal (approximately 800 000 euros) for 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and prompted his re-setting for the company that happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the General Attorney General of the Republic, which prompted the request, there would be no obstacle to refer to Cambaza, back to his old post, as the company had no disciplines after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not represent the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution which sets itself for public transparency, condemned the company's decision to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Poses a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have initiated a disciplinaract against the contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company kept silent however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps to use the relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior as well as "contradict":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be counselor after he was sentenced to jail and half of them had been lowered.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has failed to reintegrate into the company, which he helped hurt damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil, says the director of any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he was insulted him, I can't believe that someone was rewarded with such a way that has already been insulted by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack the morals to serve and to serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served themselves in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when it was a inexhaustible money source, and the state itself has become tired of having been charged and sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel, who will not only be remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, cutting and - by the contrary - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, when he was energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious human being able to be able to sell his own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he turns out of his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, with which he pervered at the contract, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Die αate (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (German: @ Truth) states that crime pays tribute to Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spheres.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Inported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network received their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people from East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "cold scripture" "" "as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension has given the rise of radical nationalist movements to the word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat them in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not call them automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the use of his use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmical words with different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spages), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was removed today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in spirit-rich manner, if she knew how he could lint his back pain, making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that it is used to reduce radically nationalist nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic, before it is all posts to spread racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook is deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">This is filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be done instead, is the post carefully analyzing and check it out by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age range).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this three-legged nationalists who use Hasspronunciation, receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their Nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action wants to send a strong signal to all that hate speech-language, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat demonstrated that the censorship of impact words often become a cat and mouse game, where users will simply use social networks to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign the post and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook community did not say."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the talk of radially nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt talk by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have had more to do in front of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Taking such words, only hatred will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not attempt to rectify the feitful posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they were only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a large turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of scorn among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now talk about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasspronunciation to see if their posts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-posts that abstained not an agreement, but nevertheless they have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmesic text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try if Facebook contains the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, the social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, speech-language in social networks should also increase violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition, especially in the Rakhine area where they have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk to his burgeese pages under control." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of taking the word 'Kalar' it would have better running, rather than in context as a code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is an end with the children of children</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Photo by Derek Gavey, CC BY 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's Parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that this practice is to offer, so that the marriage age is 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of marriage, some members passed dual and Muslim religious communities at practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the different religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere with the state that the state is not to determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN children's rights convention, the minors as,, every man under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of the children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements that were eager to abolish laws on the child before, followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped me to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's before they should take care of her own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition relieve tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime sometime came in doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against the kindergarten - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of opposition and an independent that contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which once again read Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against the children of children was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 voices, and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having decided in the Senate before, the design can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws have been finally changed to the child before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a Prime Minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary necede used to wear the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's time is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally, and that's almost every price worth.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society, who said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The old age in Trinidad and Tobago is now irrespective of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of marriage was today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives, 35 of which are present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were against were voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The kindergarten is not legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childmarriageguing.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have cast him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a advocate of the law, said it was absolutely correct when Maharaj wants to go against the law, the most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear satellite, if we are instead of talking about the discussion so generally, in a way that we invite you to talk about the state in our bedroom, that they may make use of great, hard-controlled men who are opposed to them in the advantage, would you be ready to continue discussing the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a court case against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children of child is legal or still the norm, though there are laws that they say.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers lead the Office of the Prosecutor's Office ahead of the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message that was posted on Sunday early on the site of the Prosecutor of Yaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption, which coincided with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the hackers was hacked by Yaroslavl, the hackers left a funny message. "stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Or we bring you into the jail instead of Dimon. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hackers postponed the YouTube video, "He is not Dimon for you" on the site of the Prosecutor's website with the following commentary: "the Office of the Prosecutor calls the citizens to follow the provocation, and keep away from all non-sanctioned events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">However, around 11.15 the message was removed from the page - but in the cache it remained.</seg>
<seg id="1388">It is # gentle.</seg>
<seg id="1389">On Sunday the office of the local News Service YarNews announced that they were hacked.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Through the reflection of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, leper to the SOPA (Stop online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month the Turkey has closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day, it is clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology sealed Internet users are used to use hacking tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world, most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed in 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been signposted by regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors pages (pages, which are mirrored the content of Wikipedia and frequently).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose decentralized Peer-to-Peer network (i.e. computer calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the content is not available yet.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post reports IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to check Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step has been carried out regardless of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it's only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclope.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hove similar Mirrorsites when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices a member as well as staff at Mozilla Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, an Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack on another URL, which is not the original. that's what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server runs on request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia for even if these are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivated him would carry him a camera to wear and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar will strive to bring Nepals to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town is right next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that lenose attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as it helps him first-class location at his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested me at home when Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my Father, that on the bank of Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him, and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to gain cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nepal as nature and would like to understand the understanding of that wild animals are not so furious as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, because he already stood on face to face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">Tiger leaves out of the opinion of the sheep do not disturb during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he is immediately going to see us, and he stares me through the sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to capture the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took up until he could take up a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as a part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronome or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should violate the norm to receive this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state Obesa by a pseudo-court and violate her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives is also not common in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less conditions to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, nine women, including health professionals, and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss the enquiries of the patriarchate and discuss it.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, who is operated by the community video Volunteers and sets itself for the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices, such as children's heating up to the prohibiting of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as the pilots of the murals.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini, showed in their discussion round, acted by women who don't call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To mention the names of their husbands, a roman, whom they pleaded not guilty to all obligations, and never questioned any question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered extinct, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted out that we never had thought to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name until now, wanted to try at home, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned aside to me, and said, I should name him in his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched their first discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoy, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call ourselves as they want, meaning that they should not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands more than the lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which women never married the names of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that, during the whole exercise, only went straight forward; another decided to release all the striped frustration against him and his family, by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline exhilation, with an ancient breeder, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">She was afraid as her mother-in-law, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants was less misunderstandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as trapping of the carcinogenic red dot on the forehead, which shows the husband status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred dot when he got it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not ceased, but my, they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him in some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the Discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion bill.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we have lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women who hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays for the first time in their lives with cakes. they danced and sang, talking about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things, for example, as our identities are knotted to our husbands, never so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have to talk about the concept of honour and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not geted.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe, the morality associated with saris and much more, dingggelte Rohini her own pair Kurtas (Upper hemden) in a discussion round that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure they will get it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed somewhat, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly going into rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped trying to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the line of freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and other people talk about what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping-strong persons for organ commerce, probably for aberration purposes, is worrying the police from Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. now the local government called a number of operations to life to stop the practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims has been decapitated and part of the organs were taken from.</seg>

<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South African country led a mission to investigate these practices.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A picture of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention to the international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of "Subversion" (state-endangering) after being involved in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China has referred to Lius's case as "an internal matter" and a narrator, he considers it as "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to call views of the international community, Nobel prize laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, free or allow for an treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of Paine in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman, however, refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize in Liu was given to Liu, although the Norwegian Government has hasted that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations was continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed a agreement to restore the salmon crew to China since 2010, since 2010 exports were mostly blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release to express and invited Liu to get his price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention he was not able to increase his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took, and for whom he had been strictly punished, led to a harmonious, more stable, and wealthy China, which would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged, when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, who stands for democracy, freedom and law of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During a meeting of the international branch of the international branch of the State Association of New York, the minister noted that many people have criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because it is compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned about whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Ministry of Justice, "turning logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice, this valuable land is to be created, one will say that we could not be any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the accusation before the responsibilities, a must-hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that, he was insofter undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York, to be permanent from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old serer of the authoritative machinations, which predestined to be democrats, abandoned logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end this was the last week of Shanmugam given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial authorities, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked relevant questions with non-answers rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werter K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point when it was paid high, to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on his comment on the blog, he points out on the critics that one should start to read the entire collection of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unimportant even if we are happy to give us free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compares Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was not a country, "he obviously didn't agree in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore very well...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure whether he really believes that he really believes that he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review shows the vulnerability of shanmugams argument:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "have committed a mistake" or was it a Freudder loser?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we will be considered as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back in Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally countryside and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cable-, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do people make their military service, they defend only their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">To conclude the magazine Journey of a Decade for the year, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have annoyed many people...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but that is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is asked for me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>

<seg id="1745">Then the default answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook in the course of anger, if they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes the Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag clearly visible in their rucksack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"" "" "" "so it was already, when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago -" "" "Donald Trump," "" "before the invasion of Iraq and September 11." ""</seg>

<seg id="1755">Everybody seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We are obviously very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be considered the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Nothing would account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, as "nice" to be called, is basically to be spicuous, as well as the beneficial, gentle, but tragically significant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has one of his own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can cast itself.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be harmless, to be unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that pass around a around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a prime minister of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to care about our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What we describe as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm, open kindness, which I have joined with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau sees the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has made Canada just as sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One of Thailand's famous pop band has published a music video that seized the junta, and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the persistent military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days the video was shared on Facebook highly charged video 1.254 times and received 8.800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked to the public in Thailand after a group of activists trained to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, as special as it behaves with the position of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been dilily persecuted during the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "refers to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which grants the commander-in-chief of the army's absolute decision on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminality, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to relieve activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, supervised the online content and persons accused of having slander the monarchy to have been prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strikward business against "The Majesty" (Majesty's burial).</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continue to order is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although safety expert they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax-funds.</seg>

<seg id="1803">The following article written by Dmitri Stateynov, first published on the website of OC Media, published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The post-war company is recovering only very slowly in East-Abchasies, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasische War was officially ended, but its scars are still highly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of northern districts in Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are in the coal basin of Abchasies.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, off-Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the Soviet area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of the Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today only a few hundred people in these vulture villages.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 people came, after barely had risen above a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink Brilln base and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumble walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it's rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them drugs that they can not pay, they massage them with a balm that drew from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastián travels to Boston with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other signposts of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already talk on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his departure director Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," "" "he said smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that their guests are often sending text messages when they have gone to greet them or tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul-end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family migrants are included in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a kitchen place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, and other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to get money from him, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-one, has offered it its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Today, a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, much of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she ponders her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she introduces them short.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the town of Urumqi received a cell notification where the district government indicates, to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, the app" "" "will allow access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities will also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the release of the police, the app revealed the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic web pages, from online scam, Trojan, and phishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend on online and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these features can be used naturally in a diverse manner.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or steal out.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the East and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, thronged ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, the authorities often arrange extreme itensors and security measures, as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The photographs based on Twitter based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (which were the regular news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint where policemen were checking the residents to check out whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message asked that people are installing the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you can be discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the cover technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (the regular stop of the regular intervals) also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift up the license requirements of a Windows operating system and therefore receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize circulation of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office for the operation of their computers and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American Human Rights Organization, also mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, up to August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate some "terrorist videos." this action, however, violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a number of other possible publishers, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole-quarter.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slips to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine-spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house which has been part of the West Bank since 1967; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to flee from her village in Palestine, where she lived as a felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate active activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority, and is asking for their established opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free opinion of opinion by art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism, and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find out in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that spread from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in its thinking and he can collaborate with people with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he gets a special inclination against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones, something with his identity as "Palestinian poultry eter of the second generation" - so he himself describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own life circumstances," "" "Hdaib is stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with the protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the strokes of the warm coffee and the waxes of the Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes it feels like a prison under the sky, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the Ramadan water to drink - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior of Jordan has canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">A few parliamentarians, who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert review.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" due to the sexual orientation of the scary.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like Arab spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila invalarmed the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be a rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear-crystallized reality in Jordan reflect that in Hdaibs work clearly occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional sexually choral care to body by made his vision of the fate of Arabic women who made vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently unworn unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of them they should have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">During the past years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honor' in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, there is still frightening that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women, victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for fragile control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of internal familial violence, "must be held on indefinite period in prison," and for their release, often a years of bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for that, even before the themes, that in his country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, however, that he sees his music that is full of explicit playouts on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told with politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa" ed "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" focuses on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get what you want "- is it faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgram Roya, in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context, rotated and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without carvings, but he was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still stuck thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why do Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the haschemitic kingdom there is nothing new that government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they had comments on comments in social media critical to the problems related to deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that, Hdaibs's opinion is just the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to take a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent link and take a show for him. Jordan has managed Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks quite sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately hdaib dreamt such as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them that "they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is recognized by music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streetunitions and artificial way. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time, Hdaib will continue, and thus also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of the Tohokus. another theory states that the drums, the drums and dancing over one thousand years, and from a time come, in the troops of Japan in the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in the knee.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this history, because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's hair.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important harbor, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are all daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the more norms to the experienced hands of hairdressers who can relieve this elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other in order to show who can create the excentrist Looks like you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational establishments like the Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hairdresser's tools and instead of bad advice to get an apprenticeship in hairdresser's art that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offering options, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in March before starting in March and reported some of her successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighting</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "love messages to guerrillas," which has published an international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel outstretched, affection to it?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconcile), the young people encouraged to write guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the scene of an historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement of FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace agreement was so important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the column of Colombia, however, there is a long way until one can speak of an effective reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakoos, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric of war and, around the clock, have to integrate their weapons again into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against guerrillas, it must now take in their ranks and support them with a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young column has to close together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages sent to former guerrillas to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighting - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the man that we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told her to share his love with people this year, that needed most of the most urgent assistance.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan was created, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that somebody would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the region of the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to manage the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC, as they had done earlier, to increase the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive instructions, but letters full of subordinating people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," told the political knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter made me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a type of hut in which the guerrillas are living) I saw a guerrilla who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go back, because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said to him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he answered, "I reply for a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never ever in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "I suddenly ran the tears across the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of starvation. "I never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were grown up and grew up as a war and the FARC was already hidden in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC became the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insights into its views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how to develop the social injustice by the state on the whole Colombian people, we can contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never heard that they had never found hearing, and to recognize that people who often have seen as a monster, and even hated even people with beautiful emotions, who were turned around through their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and have done so much harm to bring us something and give a smile and hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighter answers to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columnist was made aware that after the disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to lift up the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now rely on peace with the FARC on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defender of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to all of those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and bringing sacrifices, because we know of our own experience that nothing is simple. to those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2244">In terror, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which depends like a Damoklash in the LGBTQ community, is not only arisen about the night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months after reports that have been published, killing torture and killing of queens in the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Cherry was experienced by gender equality, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Fear of her life moved her last final in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transaction that was in trouble.</seg>

<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulance were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name. but the doctor stood up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>

<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much, and she took a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window of window and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My traffickers friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot comprehend how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother soon as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without register, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I checked the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you are in safety, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you see. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about sexual intercourse, however, that is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish I can't overcome this seelian barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble as the person remembers them - so that it reminds of my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed dortees?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait for the end of the Ramadan, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this, I would probably invite their relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relations, or those of their relatives have been abandoned to place Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but targeted targeted to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now a assumption, or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison, after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was involved when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. we assume that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings are of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I lived there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to come back to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but finally thrown into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were wiped; I had painted eyelashes, bore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of the Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redeem: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spote is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, if it's fun to be fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have her eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time do?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not tell us about us, but rather about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who killed before and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity is you going to go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I didn't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communed with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I graze them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I clipped a fluorider.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Cheretschens who want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay men with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans, who, the Kabardine, have those who have Russians also, on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about Transitional identity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a deceiver.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I know that I myself am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of self-morality within the poverished Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the last months, there has been a strong increase of self-morality.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 came out the desperate situation of Arab Ahwazi fellowship in Iran that is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he stooped down for his own helplessness, which can come up to his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups would like to remain in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube shared video took the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people make it fast to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegram hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">Local sources, according to local sources, were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide in which in August, within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists say on site that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights stated that this month several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have caught up.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family fathers that felt due to persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unfit to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of the Arab people living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was an autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran in the upcoming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influential and precious farm areas of the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discaring.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabians systematically workstations in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of tribes, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These rodents have only led to destroy devastation in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the local and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AHawaiian adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of co-operation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who seek a job to complete the primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmadazi Human Rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high increase" of the number of self-morality among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic people and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions don't prefer to set Arabian workers, the local Arab Ahwazi's access to work in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make it to earn their living outside of their homeland ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their pre- and surnames to hide their belonging to the ancestral azi, and so called Arab names in the workplace will not be tolerated, because the speech of the Arabic language or the trailing of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi suffer, human rights activists need alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world is waking up and knowing it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Details of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions came to an expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money, despite the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to make things up with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women face sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass covering, and that discrimination based on gender is still crosswise through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk to skin color, on racism, black cis women, on black females in the LGBTIQ commune or in black women from diaspora; if I mention, as we have always been misused under racism, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women should come together to get "their voices and" Kumbaya, my lord "to sing" to achieve the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, an institutional form of racist motivated violence, which are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin fewer earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with migrant backgrounds more often the school are rejected than white girls, due to apparent integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spammar and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women, all men and all human beings who have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose centre the white woman likes to take into account the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to both gender as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not be able to fight my affiliation in a white-femistic-oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sobener complained of 1851 in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to justify an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorbs our customs and customs to absorb their egozentish program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to try white women to determine the importance of overcutting skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different approaches to be a home and from white feminism, there is still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">"" "" "" "I am going to get rid of me full of feminism and to join me on the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn to be celebrated as a novel phenomenon." ""</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book africana womanism, says that we can defend ourselves towards our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be admired by the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately be called Separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life does not survive, nor ignores nor is rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# softer) who reports over the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissar said Ada Báez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had been violent to violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship had been a little time, and the police said, their statement would be laid to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena revealed for abuse of abuse, the actenacious advertisement of Ada Báez was not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women appear at all once, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit to be victims of violence in the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inspec1 Smurking and Statistical 2 Unseen Missions and a legal system that doesn't interruptible 3 of the laws: good approach, lack of implementation stripes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really misused, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that show not even ansatzweise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Assembly received 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went on violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads found in the police were women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence against the peacekeeping forces. 86% of the women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In these ads, 40% of women said they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show, however, not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan women's ministerial Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually indicated. "on every woman who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not one of his own crimes, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of female murders in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman died due to violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn't undertake anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she was going to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and simultaneously the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that the only women had happened to be submisled, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without names, they wrote posts on Facebook where they described his insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos herself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked why they had fallen so long from Carlos, and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse are at least a certain complicity to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listening to each other and supporting each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner, finally, managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without the result and even by their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against their former partner who developed into an unbreakable legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland in which it mainly went around money, power, and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Ays of laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not applicable.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The addiction of abuse is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, looks also great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Principal).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law sees to explain Female d to an independent offenders and harder to punish like it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature was altered in some points to win the members of the Law, who feared the way for decriminalization of abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay and are sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs, which have to bear the victims of violence at present even if they just want to receive a safe accommodation in the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislator does not provide sufficient financial resources available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a rethinking, that violence is no longer considered a little norms.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep in view of this facts, is guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to restore so long ad, until abuse is not considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016 the law of the paraguayan Senate was adopted. before, parts of the law had been changed, however, among others, a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are going apart.</seg>

<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried before the court, but returned again later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power since 1970, after he had deposited his father, Said ibn Taimur by a coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defence, chief commander of the armed forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic intelligence, public liberties, including press freedom, limit and human rights defended, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities closets peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, also activists, remember to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closing and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press was injured in Oman at the latest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Such injuries include, for example, the closure of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire their operation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack in the offer of global health care, many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a wide problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, helps establish its own research capacities in Africa. greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he worked on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambarian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Moreover, I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion of important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects will be varied well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to return or move here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory materials is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the space, the healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are limited speed, things to do and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals make items accessible to payment (the so-called "Paywall") is also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred for the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant grown by NASA Astronauts in space and has been eaten.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only given by his own accrusion and the question how many salads can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2006 he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further on breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leafy leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or cartons. because of this trends, plant breeding, environmental protector, and experts for food security ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton always serves salad, but he has no longer needed to continue his work with more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a rock falls in a river, in order to restore." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents will go to far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed any more new salads, because all of the characteristics are already patented. "he makes so good as possible and tried to breed the characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is increasingly important in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred red Roman salat of the variety Outredder in the "greenhouse-house" of the station farmed and eaten. there we have been tested if plants are grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in life to ensure that some plant species and are not protected as intellectual property, and permanently used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeder can undertake a commitment to use that other seeds are able to use farmed seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that in their seed do not continue to do business and sell it. "open source" breeder can only allow others to breed it to cross their own varieties, and it is not immediately prohibited - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seeds and the possibility to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to cut the latter not or only little to breed seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open source" "" "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecologically farming or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, as it is likely to buy good, local and sustainable producing vegetables as it is expected to grow on farmers markets, should also know that the species is farmed up, like this vegetable is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to others, to make other seeds still freely available. so, contrary to this, their predisposition is to be patented, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genious due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant materials, which therefore always be restricted, unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the director of Ossi, engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrot and their availability. she found that about a third of all carting features are protected as intellectual property, which is not even usable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not estimates, but experts like Luby assume that mass-sized plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are produced so farmed that they are targeted targeted, such as such as their taste or their color, to such, due to them in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for breeder can be derived by ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently more than ever before, since the changing conditions are worse predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto's spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsanitation activities. with a total of four genre banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States, the company is responsible for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it does contradict that intellectual property can handle other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variety of innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that can follow each other as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection, therefore, does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by using the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent strap, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and also should remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton interferes along with the concept of creating plant features: "we are not creating the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants constitute themselves out and as breeder we have finally no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding: "those who pose a variety, also chill his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed to be required for their cultivation. rubbicides are needed to breed in its varieties of this concept of farming.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it will create most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patented or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in its breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder is innovative by avoidance of plant patents of innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years even, "he says." with a patent it's been protected for 20 years before competition, with which it simply makes my opinion quite beautiful. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "open source" seed program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an "open source" licence, which ultimately is an informal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from land to land, absent for the Ossi obligation to be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional chaired plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks to the present practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents for conventional chased plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is now the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, to the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards fragility of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" seed systems, states that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, which should be scheduled next year of the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published global Alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have the possibility to exchange and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will be recognised.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has especially considered, where and as something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "Luby." "" "we are trying to clear the people that there is even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Collectible in spite of this attack and the failure of the Egyptian Law and the constitution to defend this goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the lock and do not pursue it. we hope to keep our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network in Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the shaft of the website. @ anhri received one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI there is also no access to Egypt's blog and human rights advocates Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columnist and articles that he has no accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he established to bypass the Egyptian government's apparatus, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and took a video like police physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly turn around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada outlined the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The to unlock blogs is very old but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege condition; an arrest, an attempted murder, loading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have shown that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 websites. this revealed technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, by changing Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we saw how the blocking of websites, which offer VPNs, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests that the government's intention is to block and filtering content to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is caused by this, in addition, that the censing decisions are made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it may lead before the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest city of the country and home of several postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Jeeps himself killed a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Thieves screwed Pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air afee to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a split financial situation, the violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation of Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio" "" "Extra" "" "on 16 August the Editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which they announced, a new section called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, is published by the civilized standard and what is only in Rio. (...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so we do not close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, said that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explained that there are 843 areas according to the Institute's Internal Security Council, which will be controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war course, when it is distorted, can also be used, Grassamity of the police, which only shoot and then ask questions, to extinguish.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than they benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira is argued that violence as "war." this would be difficult to have a justification of failed safety policy by the media and could make it harder to rule the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education, and a historic and self-counterfeit neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">For memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as the "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong with Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil, according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No one of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is located on No.16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra is the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, which, as Cecília is stressed, has repeated the Security Policy of the State for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policies, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela of a massive police unit and stationed a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, the UPP took part in several reports about chicans and repressions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under guard.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his article published in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria of the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state, resources and paths which are typical for a war. this is the intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateralment" and "concealed bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continues to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police force the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho erklomm to assassinate the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident made headlines: an orchard died due to shots taken by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to conventional, planting in Syria and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mujahedin groupings which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at this time Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew she would no longer see her son very long - maybe even more.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban were getting nearer for their hate to the Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found herself again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohesitation. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left out of his small wages, and went into Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the lives of Afghan refugees were shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon before the open windows, so that we don't get frying at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran behind and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf left homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that was distributed twice on the day food in need.</seg>
<seg id="2897">True, it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that seek asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special admission centers. it is a improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a admission center if they officially declared a request for asylum - which can still go for asylum after the registration of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">By then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbunky lifestyle helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years working in construction industry several years, Asharaf spent his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a snail.</seg>
