that is James R@@ isen .
perhaps you know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
in this case , he describes an cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret operation , which the CIA literally over@@ threw the designs of nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like it ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train it became a symbol of the government of the government to condemn the hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving .
so when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were for years , it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and r@@ isen for statements , this could also do its digital foot tracks for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , secretly buried his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel information with the list of flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ es .
unfortunately , this is one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower in his lawyer . but instead , justice has more condemned than all U.S. governments together .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of being a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers going to a journalist .
so , we put the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional approach , because the government has always has more possibilities to sp@@ ying all of them .
but just like technology the government allowed to avoid rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact them from the moment in which they contact us instead of in retro@@ fit , in the witness stand .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source inter@@ mitt@@ ance system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the site of Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was now working from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , like with every ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide more information secretly , and many of the information they would like , would not be available in advance .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies , all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology sector like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to apply ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important to protect the next w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers of modest and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a pilgrimage @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of history has been revealed . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a member of the brutal Syrian dictator , Bashar al @-@ Assad Brief@@ ly , has entered into tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it will be claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is : when the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from some of them to hide and conce@@ aled -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this world and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always make it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , that sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we have a data le@@ ck of Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library certificate .
this kind of transparent in the US has allowed the employees of school districts allowed to zoom school children .
it has allowed us to zoom out especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 legal companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ ects money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all until one lawyer made suggestions of our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers accepted us as a client , and of course , nobody was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ spread our criminal investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single leading political leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , being established through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may sound very comfor@@ ted , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has changed ; as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as a born optim@@ istic , I can quite see that something has started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen demonstrations to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind .
representatives of both parties signed a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , being used as funds to ensure in the United States and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind the head@@ companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to finish this kind of int@@ ent .
together , we can finally stop this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I have been kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my matters .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping today ? &quot;
he did the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans to land . I don &apos;t want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air matt@@ resses . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ red on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I do with me ?
a wild sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sitting on toe toe at the door , and my sleep door shut off .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is a teacher now .
this was my first experience as hosts . it has completely changed my view@@ angle .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood have been sold , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air matt@@ resses , I was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses .
let us take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ th@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air bran@@ ching and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle , Brian and I joined .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came to rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website dedicated to public photographs from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closed , when visiting us .
on the Internet , you can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but indeed they are not .
no one who is still consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are thinking of things that can be good . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before .
can design be something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I want to give you a cost sample , which degree of confidence we em@@ bal@@ m .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone to hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this soft@@ ly flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone from a stranger to your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
the most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
for this reason , our company can exist .
but who is now Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone now ?
could you tell Twitter that he can@@ di@@ des for the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have been imag@@ ined with his name ; if he would have told how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essments that all say : &quot; he can really keep his mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your cell phone ?
because a well balanced feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative evidence .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their ass@@ essments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we investigated how likely it is that people depend on each other , depending on the age and residential location .
little surprising , we trust the people most , who are similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ sures .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if you have less than three app@@ rais@@ als , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good call is composed of simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much one is priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell little about how , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
tell too much , as for example : &quot; I &apos;m having problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there &apos;s an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I am doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create with design this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
where@@ with we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us , business goes straight very well .
of course there are also times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been allowed to celebrate part@@ ys or dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , of the 123 million over@@ nights only a fra@@ ction had a problem .
for people trusted in each other .
when confidence works , it can be created at all .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who tend to cultiv@@ ate heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who save lives , although they don &apos;t know it right .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they will even stay longer , without charge extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is , of course , not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of the part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s all about an economic trading .
but it simply is simply &quot; rental industry &quot; to name , the thing is not fair .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay down a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you are travelling nowadays , this is to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but not authentic .
but what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at every place you visited , a group there would wait to complete a group there , to show a thor@@ ough and one at a pub tour , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of reason for sharing ?
how would that look like ?
what would be , if cities would receive the thoughts of common shares ?
I imagine cities , which enable us to provide company and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sc@@ ot@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were guests offered now . students who were searching for a stay ,
were im@@ mobil@@ ised by people whose children were moved out . there were incubation programs started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . more than our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it has been taught .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why does our work exactly ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of trust .
design can help us overcome deep@@ ened pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da is passing over me .
we know , of course , that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design shortly .
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ tak@@ ingly under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent what I like .
a study showed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
presumably people don &apos;t speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it is great to get you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee pot -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ ant @-@ fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to have a decision .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to carry the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : it was a feminist independence of independence , but compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not just received passive the faith of my parents .
I have the Koran .
I read it , thought , I thought , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened himself with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k will sometimes bring me to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone tru@@ sts you , you completely understands , and still loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began to like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning was in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end to the screen , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Express &quot; .
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ouses out of buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the deeds of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Central West of the US to move into a new city and start learning studies .
I remember , as I knew -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to become acquain@@ ted as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mo@@ ck you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ il@@ ted , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people , which were in favour of Muslims , and struck free .
there was really bran@@ dan@@ ists on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt right .
because people who had attacked this land , attacked our land .
I have noticed the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can really say people , &quot; There is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it &apos;s just the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is being removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ ers and Paralymp@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques more secure ?
perhaps there will be a few parking fre@@ ak@@ age , but not stop terror .
the regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and to show larger civil action .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one found that it will start online . as a result , the person will take off on their community , that the extreme group believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming , Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their pre@@ ferences , if one acknowle@@ dges them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at it , she doesn &apos;t drive what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because they are brilliant to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought them to silence , and told her that her anger , their sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
from nothing was inspired and something that had given her anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to her a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he demonstrated her construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , they kept it to join the IS .
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
what is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ fic studies -- show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we accept a author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when considering test persons messages , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim Terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to establish the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear fell to everyone .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her life run . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man from my breasts ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ smus can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in whom we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided to go to the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , attracted my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then , the Im@@ am announcement , than@@ ked than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment I have collapsed .
these people were there , because they had taken courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ smus ?
will you go to number safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what you say that you are saying that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mem@@ or@@ ator with depth , therefore an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , you are not mist@@ aken . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest in @-@ guided study at Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I was an exception in no sense .
if people appear as a rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , shortly before , become a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ one . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air @-@ p@@ act in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting you reach flying devices high speed and acceleration in the closest room .
you can also build self @-@ adhesive structures .
you have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible flight .
thus a system of autonomous works , it must collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are at the highest flat@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so@@ unding rear starter ,
a flying machine , which tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other Star@@ r@@ all@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
contrary to most star@@ ters , it may be ho@@ ver , and has so great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind b@@ ays .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ man doesn &apos;t matter in what situation is able to reg@@ ain the optimal position and improves performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that inv@@ ade the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts , which are av@@ eng@@ ed to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flying devices which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ oring .
we discovered , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled flight machine . it was invented recently .
it only has a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , it happens very much in the interior , so that it can travel stable , and can move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it exactly right when I see all , is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon inner is an exercise in gender , this machine is here , the omni@@ directional with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore , he is ambitious in its alignment .
thereby he receives the greatest capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
naturally , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest will be lear@@ nt right when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this turns in clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails to fly electronics or battery -- the machine can fly further , although limited .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one disc bread -- and stat@@ ute them with local technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine here , however , would like to be a flying lamp on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types , as is the reward in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart ra@@ fts allowed to form it as a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes were always qu@@ icker , they turned the mass triple but@@ s in a t@@ enth@@ esis in pure energy .
this short moment lighted her brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very large b@@ ang .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over into space @-@ time ge@@ aring , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then , the earth has produced some : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at -- even the internet .
approximately 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most kept them for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy gen@@ ies , so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Gra@@ vity Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which improved the recognition performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth is through .
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ gh@@ ter
and the farewell from my death sick .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked for , is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gravity ha@@ fts from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a cra@@ ck@@ eting in the composition of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its overall content will be stretched in a direction and put into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ turers &quot; lec@@ turers &quot; lead to the Rel@@ ativity Theory often a proper al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched out to the waves of the waves . the dehy@@ d@@ ration of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o associates for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured exactly as a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear radius . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when construc@@ ting such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims , Lig@@ o is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite convenient . because so you can create a picture or a map of things by using multiple points coming around you .
on tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you especially much :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
same applies to gravity shafts .
we can &apos;t make them simple pictures of objects in all .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern into notes , we can hear it all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation of l@@ ousy , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott employs a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circul@@ ates with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a sort of motion sensor , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 tube , orbit a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to investigate the Al@@ ls , as it was never possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the all , and hear the invisible .
much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or in principle .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the All .
the thri@@ lling physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first step of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o lets us take a completely different perspective on the events in all , to the emergence of the stars , and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists , as cour@@ ageous as only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circular of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in all .
because what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
I tried a experiment from some time ago .
for one year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear , to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Y@@ ep that changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly species . it began with a question of my smallest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls out of un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot; sk@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ew , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her once I could play with her when I was on the jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from then on , I always try to play with them once you do it . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; might be saved with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things off , wake up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I do TV in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for that 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode , every nine days , four television programs , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I have created itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ aled . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that around the world burn .
do you know who this still does ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I tell it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you work so hard if you &apos;re doing a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously , so that you don &apos;t just walk around the computer , and it &apos;s true , if I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am going to work in work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it is when I turned troops , as painted on a screen .
as a dream you have a high tone , you delivered a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and de@@ fi@@ antly , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me if the work goes well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , I could always go on her .
many people assume , if I bear them the sum@@ s , that I talk about writing that writing me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production , when I started working and work to work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than size .
the feeling that can not be different to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it means genius .
maybe it means ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question .
to make a clear : the more ever more episodes , the more episodes , the more labour , the more things there are , the more things at the same time , the more things I write story , the more things I write story , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that their mom is one of the only workers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; Sh@@ ew , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Country . &quot;
these are the children of an Tit@@ ans .
they are baby titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours a day , working weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , do not sleep on , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what makes you what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some may think : &quot; loc@@ ust you , the author of the author Titan . &quot;
but you know what you are doing , you are working , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ s feel when the sum@@ s stopped , when the sum@@ s stop , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when listening to my heart &apos;s song , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to tell no more than two things are aware of :
first , I must say Yes to everything and second , she called me no &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it if I &apos;m in Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
that &apos;s nothing special .
we play and help her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and absence of Sum@@ mens , can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wa@@ xes and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl can release in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
the opposite of works is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost arrives .
and that doesn &apos;t happen instantly , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the worker , the Titan@@ ic@@ um@@ men , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are , when I say to you , if I am writing me using ship@@ ments and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
real Sum@@ ms is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from life &apos;s desire .
real Sum@@ men is Self @-@ Consci@@ ousness and Peace .
real Sum@@ ma igno@@ res the pressure of the history , which are experiencing tasks , expec@@ tation and print .
genuine sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will tell Yes .
I do this for a firm rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good at play , I don &apos;t like it .
to play is not ans@@ at@@ tw@@ ise as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at work as home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man is better to work as a house ?
well , I think .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I need problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them is .
we r@@ v@@ ens around in the garden , back and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we gr@@ ate soap bubbles .
I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me .
I play and play until I wonder : why did we stop playing with the game ?
you can also say it ! if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you &apos;ll keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day of meeting .
you may be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they are showing that they want to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and my te@@ ens @-@ daughter speak for 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not .
everyone can bring about 15 minutes on a piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes at a time !
no mobile phone , no washing , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to take you .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul fri@@ ght .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it .
I am not perfect in it . I am up@@ swing and I victories . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to know more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not allow you to indul@@ ge 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s back in my free time . the sum@@ s then seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door open , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it ful@@ fills me and my soul . I lead me into new ideas . I use it into full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... not anymore .
bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and therefore I am so thank@@ ful .
I am sorry that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays the journey to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to less work and play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet , I have everything in grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , I run , the troops , the fla@@ x walls , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the right , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling in me wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I am considering you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and play . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other physi@@ o@@ organs , has a very low ability to sound healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
in fact , they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; low@@ land hir@@ n@@ ul@@ ulation . &quot; in this im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ert one has an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from heavy trem@@ ors and heavy pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was senior chief physician and working day and night in the emergency department .
often I provided patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that brain trau@@ mas presents the brain @-@ will@@ t and scal@@ ding pressure .
to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial re@@ print .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue , comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you must find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to let it prosp@@ er .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it managed to make Jean François Hollande .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you know from the biology classes , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they share slowly and after a few weeks they died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play an important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but that is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non @-@ language and then to cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark the color to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re@@ im@@ planted them at the exception of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we rec@@ tal these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we rec@@ ise the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken back after a few weeks , they would be taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we put an injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we paint in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a cereb@@ ral injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take food pellets for one tablet .
they made them very well .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we had the motor mot@@ oring range in the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , it re@@ covers spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ tic brain mechanisms . you can recover at a certain degree , just as in the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys , which spont@@ aneously re@@ covering .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from bre@@ ach of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rip@@ ening .
I can say to you , that were very exciting for us .
since that time , we found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neurop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in people .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how to give us the human brain the means to heal herself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely need .
of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles , before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you see further into the future , how many years it takes to come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you need to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
one must first think that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you told us .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as of course .
we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant , which it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ti@@ dings .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is possible to have thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is overcome with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ad@@ missible friends who would repeat me if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to imagine an economic model for real democracy .
I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are handmade , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
regarding the waste of waste , I want to point you at an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently threat@@ ens our economy .
I call it the &quot; twin summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which throws its long shade over the US , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt berg ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ polluted cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest there , where it could be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt berg and also produce all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the euro zone , 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin summit , which does not compens@@ ate through the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low total economic demand that would not invest in which they would not invest . just like the o@@ bedience , that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ wanted the circumstances suggest that o@@ di@@ pus kills him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially promote all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ize the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these out@@ lines .
the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor , and not only the right of expression on freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of the state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
like a candle that lit very bright , it is burned too fast .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies didn &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute of ruling .
for the liberal democracy came first , as a complete separation from politics and economy possible , and the democratic process has been appe@@ aled to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democra@@ tically deep zone became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our today &apos;s democra@@ cies since the time of which this separation from politics and economy began to mig@@ rate an un@@ question@@ able battle between the two , and the economy gradually mig@@ rations politics and dis@@ emp@@ t them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is obvious that nowadays it can be in the government nowadays , and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics into the economy is different and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y , which is so sustainable the animals , of whom she nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they may be star@@ ving at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar with the economy that grows so far from the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are increasing , the total ine@@ quality is rising , and the management of companies are rising to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowd &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; maintains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and fore@@ ig@@ ner .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only gained a position as in an ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor is abol@@ ished !
capitalism does it by replacing low glo@@ om by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separated , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste present , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must unite the economy and the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we have a united area &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; otherwise we will appear in a disease monitoring Hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ tie , which lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive - &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is going to be replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , or something similar in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples shortly .
in the field of companies please ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues come from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
there are no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not working therein , and employees that work there , but no diving more between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and sphere , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin summit .
in the area of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies had a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest economies &#93; in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos , &quot; and every government is paying the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or trading of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world that I describe you is simultaneously liber@@ alised in which she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nesi@@ an , global key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we be bl@@ ink in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography even as a liber@@ ally Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do we not do that , technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely in@@ verteb@@ ra@@ e .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the note of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited the democracy , while the area where most of the economy plays , -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone .
in certain ways , if I may say this so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what to watch in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now t@@ oss to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells vast to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as the finance ministers of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and sustained den@@ ial that a massive mer@@ g@@ ation line was passed through the euro zone , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
making it right . unfortunately , the forces within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable in life through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be possible to delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destroyed .
BG : which changes you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est juice ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for pro@@ clamation of the end of February .
I thought it was an honest interest in pages of the fin@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the promises they ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy , conf@@ essed to us : &quot; that was a kol@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cri@@ tique of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from somebody who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive .
for if they do not survive , the released air forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we admit ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after what it appears to me , it will be as well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re going wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an Irish @-@ term and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard fought sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation .
will be your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that you are addic@@ ted , where , after you looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more from these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has more thoughts about the middle exit , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t inspire them .
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time to make Amazon as something , therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needed guaranteed success , so he stops a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses 8 candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and introduces them online where they can look at each one .
and if Amazon is in charge of free things , it is access@@ able , right ?
millions of viewers are viewing this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed during viewing this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , who receive everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ ps or look again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company another manager has got a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a Super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of having a contest , he and his team looked at the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went to a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very funny , data sealed .
they combine these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years on statistics as a back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
the minute , what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is somewhat sc@@ ary , because we live in a time , in which we can take more and more statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data sealed the data are even wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis of flu , the worse way can be predic@@ table -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news message . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data can accum@@ ulate in decisions of life -- at work , in law , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of an drug . over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mostly do two things :
as a result , put this problem into its individual parts , so you can analyse the components ; as a second place you put together the items together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not appropriate to put the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , there are parts and pieces once again , even if the information is in@@ complete , especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , for what else they could not have been able to put together . but the decision to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however , on the contrary , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they w@@ ett@@ led TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they were always able to say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things will go wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or No @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , where I would have to hear in mind on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic body .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel it as a very encouraging news that , despite the great amount of data still paid out , make decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks to go .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
