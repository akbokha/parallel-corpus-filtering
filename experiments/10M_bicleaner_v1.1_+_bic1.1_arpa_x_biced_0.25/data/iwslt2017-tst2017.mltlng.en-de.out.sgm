<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this case, he describes an catastrophic US secret operation, which the CIA literally overthrew the designs of nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like it?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train it became a symbol of the government of the government to condemn the histleblowers and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were for years, it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risen for statements, this could also do its digital foot tracks for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his understanding, secretly buried his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel information with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Rises.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower in his lawyer. but instead, justice has more condemned than all U.S. governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of being a whistleblowers going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional approach, because the government has always has more possibilities to spying all of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology the government allowed to avoid reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact them from the moment in which they contact us instead of in retrofit, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than regular e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is Securedrop, an open source intermittance system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the site of Aaron Swartz, which was now working from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, like with every ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information they would like, would not be available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies, all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to us to ensure that not only technology sector like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to apply iniquities. it is just as important to protect the next whistleblowers." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers of modest and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a pilgrimage-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leck of history has been revealed.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's resident law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers such as Mospack Fonseca go and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a member of the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad Briefly, has entered into tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It will be claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens from some of them to hide and concealed -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this world and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always make it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we have a data leck of Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library certificate.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparent in the US has allowed the employees of school districts allowed to zoom school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed us to zoom out especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator in the offices of 13 legal companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspects money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all until one lawyer made suggestions of our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers accepted us as a client, and of course, nobody was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has underspread our criminal investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading political leaders, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, being established through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforted, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has changed; as if there is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimistic, I can quite see that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen demonstrations to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties signed a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, being used as funds to ensure in the United States and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their real identity behind the headcompanies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that stand up and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to finish this kind of intent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I have been kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my matters.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where are you sleeping today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans to land. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have an air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I starred on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I do with me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sitting on toe toe at the door, and my sleep door shut off.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as hosts. it has completely changed my viewangle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood have been sold, actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattresses, I was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plethite, my roommate moves and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air branching and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle, Brian and I joined.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website dedicated to public photographs from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed, when visiting us.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, you can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are thinking of things that can be good. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a cost sample, which degree of confidence we embalm.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone to hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This softly flight of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone from a stranger to your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">The most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But who is now Al Gores's mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he candides for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been imagined with his name; if he would have told how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really keep his mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well balanced feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted with Stanford a study. we investigated how likely it is that people depend on each other, depending on the age and residential location.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising, we trust the people most, who are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pressures.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three appraisals, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call is composed of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much one is priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell little about how, "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell too much, as for example: "I'm having problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there's an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great art works in your apartment! I am doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create with design this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Wherewith we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business goes straight very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to celebrate partys or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hear in the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnights only a fraction had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it can be created at all.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to cultivate heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who save lives, although they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They will even stay longer, without charge extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's all about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it simply is simply "rental industry" to name, the thing is not fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay down a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you are travelling nowadays, this is to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but not authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at every place you visited, a group there would wait to complete a group there, to show a thorough and one at a pub tour, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be, if cities would receive the thoughts of common shares?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities, which enable us to provide company and relationships, instead of loneliness and scotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were guests offered now. students who were searching for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were immobilised by people whose children were moved out. there were incubation programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. more than our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy, as it has been taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deepened prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda is passing over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design shortly.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, undertakingly underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent what I like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people don't speak to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it is great to get you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee pot -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant-fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oun me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to carry the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: it was a feminist independence of independence, but compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just received passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, I thought, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened himself with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik will sometimes bring me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone trusts you, you completely understands, and still loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began to like all good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning was in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end to the screen, looked at the screen and saw the word "Express".</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people spouses out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "Jihad..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the deeds of others by a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Central West of the US to move into a new city and start learning studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I knew -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid to become acquainted as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be watchful," "Seid cautious," "lead in well lit areas," "Don't mock you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "don't go on this first Friday the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unilted, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people, which were in favour of Muslims, and struck free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really brandanists on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have noticed the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can really say people, "There is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is being removed as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Ersthelers and Paralympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few parking freakage, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and to show larger civil action.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one found that it will start online. as a result, the person will take off on their community, that the extreme group believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming, Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their preferences, if one acknowledges them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at it, she doesn't drive what they are in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they are brilliant to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought them to silence, and told her that her anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing was inspired and something that had given her anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their anger, he demonstrated her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, they kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">What is the 24-hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when considering test persons messages, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim Terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to establish the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear fell to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, most generous person, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her life run. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a sealed young man from my breasts?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatismus can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in whom we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, attracted my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me to stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam announcement, thanked thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had taken courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanatismus?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say that you are saying that you are holding a TEDTalk, a memorator with depth, therefore an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, you are not mistaken. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually am as usual.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the greatest in-guided study at Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I was an exception in no sense.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, shortly before, become a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drone. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air-pact in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting you reach flying devices high speed and acceleration in the closest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-adhesive structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system of autonomous works, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are at the highest flate. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "landing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a sounding rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine, which tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrallgler, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Contrary to most starters, it may be hover, and has so great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind bays.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airman doesn't matter in what situation is able to regain the optimal position and improves performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that invade the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which are avenged to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled flying devices which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a tailoring.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-controlled flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, it happens very much in the interior, so that it can travel stable, and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it exactly right when I see all, is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon inner is an exercise in gender, this machine is here, the omnidirectional with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, he is ambitious in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the greatest capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be conceivable in models, the rest will be learnt right when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails to fly electronics or battery -- the machine can fly further, although limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one disc bread -- and statute them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine here, however, would like to be a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types, as is the reward in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart rafts allowed to form it as a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes were always quicker, they turned the mass triple buts in a tenthesis in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment lighted her brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very large bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed over into space-time gearing, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago was a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced some: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Approximately 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise approximately by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy genies, so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser Interferometer Gravity Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collized black holes through the earth is through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death sick.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked for, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravity hafts from black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a cracketing in the composition of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its overall content will be stretched in a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers "lecturers" lead to the Relativity Theory often a proper alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us stretched out to the waves of the waves. the dehydration of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the Comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo associates for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured exactly as a thousandths of a nuclear radius. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "the technical difficulties when constructing such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finalist and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims, Ligo is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can create a picture or a map of things by using multiple points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">On tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">Same applies to gravity shafts.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make them simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into notes, we can hear it all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation of lousy, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott employs a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circulates with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of motion sensor, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 tube, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a completely new way to investigate the Alls, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the all, and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can't see -- practically or in principle.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we've never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first step of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo lets us take a completely different perspective on the events in all, to the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists, as courageous as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circular of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">I tried a experiment from some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year, I would say "Yes!" I was afraid of which I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yep that changed my life on an unexpectedly species. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls out of unexplainable reasons all "skittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">She would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "Shew, I need milk for my cabling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked her once I could play with her when I was on the jump." "" "and I said," "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-setting in my family. from then on, I always try to play with them once you do it. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the "Yes" might be saved with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things off, wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for that 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, every nine days, four television programs, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV-hours are shipments that I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obscaled. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans about bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you work so hard if you're doing a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously, so that you don't just walk around the computer, and it's true, if I say: I understand that it's not going to dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am going to work in work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I turned troops, as painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream you have a high tone, you delivered a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and defiantly, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, I could always go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I bear them the sums, that I talk about writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with television production, when I started working and work to work and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't strive differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that can not be different to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more ever more episodes, the more episodes, the more labour, the more things there are, the more things at the same time, the more things I write story, the more things I write story, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"" "" "" "now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is one of the only workers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "Shew, I want to go to Shonda Country."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same title work, 15 hours a day, working weekend, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, do not sleep on, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some may think: "locust you, the author of the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you are doing, you are working, one loves to be a teacher, a banker who knows to be a teacher, a banker who knows the sums, and knows how the sums feel when the sums stopped, when the sums stop, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When listening to my heart's song, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states-waitress" "" "is a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to tell no more than two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everything and second, she called me no "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it if I'm in Titan and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">That's nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and help her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and absence of Summens, can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, waxes and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl can release in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">The opposite of works is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost arrives.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen instantly, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the worker, the Titanicummen, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are, when I say to you, if I am writing me using shipments and TV-hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real Summs is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from life's desire.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real Summen is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real Summa ignores the pressure of the history, which are experiencing tasks, expectation and print.</seg>
<seg id="713">Genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sum of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will tell Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for a firm rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at play, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">To play is not ansattwise as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at work as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a man is better to work as a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I need problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rvens around in the garden, back and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grate soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why did we stop playing with the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you'll keep me for naive, for a day of meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You may be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they are showing that they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teens-daughter speak for 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring about 15 minutes on a piece, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at a time!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to take you.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it is not to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul fright.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums back in my free time. the sums then seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door open, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fulfills me and my soul. I lead me into new ideas. I use it into full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other physioorgans, has a very low ability to sound healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">In fact, they have heard from one of the most famous, the "lowland hirnululation." in this implantiert one has an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from heavy tremors and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was senior chief physician and working day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain traumas presents the brain-willt and scalding pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to diminish the cranial reprint.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue, comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to let it prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it managed to make Jean François Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology classes, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They share slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non-language and then to cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark the color to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimplanted them at the exception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we rectal these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we recise the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken back after a few weeks, they would be taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we put an injury and reimplanted the same cells, and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a cerebral injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets for one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we had the motor motoring range in the motic Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, it recovers spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastitic brain mechanisms. you can recover at a certain degree, just as in the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys, which spontaneously recovering.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from breach of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the ripening.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say to you, that were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how to give us the human brain the means to heal herself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely need.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles, before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you see further into the future, how many years it takes to come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you need to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first think that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy than the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable tidings.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is possible to have thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is overcome with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my admissible friends who would repeat me if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to imagine an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are handmade, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding the waste of waste, I want to point you at an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economy.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shade over the US, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt berg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unpolluted cash, which is to be anxious to invest there, where it could be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt berg and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the euro zone, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compares it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin summit, which does not compensate through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low total economic demand that would not invest in which they would not invest. just like the obedience, that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances suggest that odipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially promote all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle's defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minimize the job value of the Athenian democracy because of these outlines.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor, and not only the right of expression on freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lit very bright, it is burned too fast.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies didn't have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute of ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came first, as a complete separation from politics and economy possible, and the democratic process has been appealed to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratically deep zone became.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our today's democracies since the time of which this separation from politics and economy began to migrate an unquestionable battle between the two, and the economy gradually migrations politics and disempt them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is obvious that nowadays it can be in the government nowadays, and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is different and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of robbery, which is so sustainable the animals, of whom she nourishes, decimated, that they may be starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar with the economy that grows so far from the self-caused economic crisis itself." "" "the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are increasing, the total inequality is rising, and the management of companies are rising to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism the" "" "crowd [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" maintains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only gained a position as in an ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor is abolished!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low gloom by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separated, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste present, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must unite the economy and the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we have a united area" "", "otherwise we will appear in a disease monitoring Hyperautocratie, which lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "like a documentary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive -" ""</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is going to be replaced by a dystopia, or something similar in "Star Trek" in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like, how could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies please ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues come from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">There are no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not working therein, and employees that work there, but no diving more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and sphere, and ultimately no emporal twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies had a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest economies] in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos," and every government is paying the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or trading of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is simultaneously liberalised in which she prefers privileged persons, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we be blink in a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography even as a liberally Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... do we not do that, technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis of a part of the earth to the next one, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and that's why I am completely invertebrae.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited the democracy, while the area where most of the economy plays, -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain ways, if I may say this so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What to watch in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now toss to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells vast to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance ministers of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to complacency, and sustained denial that a massive mergation line was passed through the euro zone, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Making it right. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable in life through political will and authitarianism, it may be possible to delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which changes you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest juice...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for proclamation of the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought it was an honest interest in pages of the finders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the promises they ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika, who imposed this policy, confessed to us: "that was a kolossaler mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of the talks, you seem to be quite per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the eurozone comes from somebody who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone won't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released air forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"" "" "" "if we admit ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, after what it appears to me, it will be as well tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're going wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Irish-term and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will be your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that you are addicted, where, after you looked at a season, your brain asks: "where are there more from these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what goes at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price doesn't worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He has more thoughts about the middle exit, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it's the first time to make Amazon as something, therefore Roy Price wants nothing to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needed guaranteed success, so he stops a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses 8 candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and introduces them online where they can look at each one.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is in charge of free things, it is accessable, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed during viewing this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you paused, which parts you skips or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and it results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company another manager has got a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a Super show and he uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of having a contest, he and his team looked at the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went to a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very funny, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minute, what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is somewhat scary, because we live in a time, in which we can take more and more statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data sealed the data are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis of flu, the worse way can be predictable -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news message. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year, until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data can accumulate in decisions of life -- at work, in law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of an drug. over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, put this problem into its individual parts, so you can analyse the components; as a second place you put together the items together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not appropriate to put the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, there are parts and pieces once again, even if the information is incomplete, especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, for what else they could not have been able to put together. but the decision to put together all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however, on the contrary, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they wettled TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they were always able to say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things will go wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or No-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, where I would have to hear in mind on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel it as a very encouraging news that, despite the great amount of data still paid out, make decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks to go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">At the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
