Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ pin , where young people are to meet up today .
a tomb of greeting , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener farms the ru@@ sty reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying , if maps are not up to date .
everyone knows that had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was instead of an Um@@ bre@@ ach road to a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compar@@ es them with current online @-@ cards .
then , how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Mercury &apos;s spread @-@ area since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ep@@ ad , which one cannot recognize as such .
in the great over@@ sight card , for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps were built , so @-@ called judgments .
according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration , these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 , during the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course to military purposes .
even if the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who create the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration .
the Ur@@ gen@@ blatt for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all other on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of the morning / today is the most impressive example of the capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ routine that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , the city is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Austria concentrate around 1856 along the today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ ress , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers &apos; uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance : in the execution , a small @-@ part map with dozens lines and numbers : handwritten fl@@ ur@@ ers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ bino , &quot; which has been derived from the basic tax .
small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of the under@@ line .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 of the October of October , was actually a lawn - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the alleg@@ ations , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; district of the Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen &apos;s District name , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ins@@ ets .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich county @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ ne was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the name of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he has prohibited the staff to turn violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients first place have been space , later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity also ranged from - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ er@@ esis in Hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
on the area of former Au@@ er pin , young people encounter the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order gained the building complex in 1920 , and turned it into a youth home with training .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 they built the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - based on the origin of the origin of the Ir@@ vine , who had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded in 1856 as &quot; main square , &quot; the purchase road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger lane . &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the mouth .
the Allies &apos;s bombs broke down many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof where these days work on April 5 , 2017 , the breaking @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track line .
with the shooting gallery , the old Munich map will be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof hole .
civil Rights published in travel agent for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has exhibited a warning for colored people who travel due to discrimin@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Mis@@ souri , which will bring special attention to the state by the State of Mis@@ souri by August 28 , 2017 , as a number of frag@@ ile , road @-@ based accidents occur in the recent state and noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the position of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to gain dis@@ crimin@@ ation , as well as the prosecution of the state , which aim to take effect on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to publish the it@@ iner@@ ary , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries to the civil rights , people pass .
they are stopped due to their skin color , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist attacks against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the trip through the state by the State of Mis@@ souri , without being accused of crimes .
the Council also points on a recently published report by the Office of the Office @-@ General of Mis@@ souri , in which black drivers in the state will be more frequent in the state 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff have informed about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring it money or to their relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ souri recorded 100 of them in hate , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s anti @-@ crime program , which steps the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri Act which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel bud@@ get@@ ations for Texas and Arizona have adopted the local prosec@@ utions authorities to commit people because of immigration o@@ bedience , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U for further expansion .
travel covers are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have deployed the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ us project is elementary
the fish@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a success project and is continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliamentary Group Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac secured a picture on the spot .
for the right @-@ gra@@ vey@@ ard of the family of Schwen@@ demann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ demann gave first insight into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ du@@ ste there is only regional .
since it is also the BL@@ HV chairman of Fish@@ bach , he described the crossover project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t make any recovery on the type of surface .
green land@@ scap@@ ing care for a lot of work , much should be processed with the sense sense .
&quot; we have been working here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the crossover project and is glad about the leaders promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
we hope that the rest@@ oring of the areas could still be moved even for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers stand due to promoting often in the criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ en@@ forced until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros was funded by half of the leader , a quarter carried out by the community of Fish@@ bach .
in this way , farmers have to invest 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac empha@@ sized : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß was also fixed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ area policy ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of women &apos;s f@@ ences .
the aim is to restore the Black Forest .
requirement is the presence of one by the l@@ p@@ r conveyor belt .
in addition , the area should not be in@@ sufficient ( hang@@ over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the cancellation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running , which would like to build up just about 16 kilometers of fence in 2018 .
the open area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans do appreciate this as well as any other - hence the cre@@ denti@@ st of Saddam H@@ uss@@ eins portra@@ yed at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot war with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN about the suggestions of pre@@ sidents to dramatic lim@@ iting the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have had an yn@@ chron@@ ous if he had done it .
but he touched their importance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom which enligh@@ tened the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem , which you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your poor , your poor , and the th@@ ron@@ ged masses that are looking for free to breathe freely ; the el@@ eventh waste of your rich coast@@ lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps United States .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who decided to place their words after their death in the base - knew very well that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the composition with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to switch from the right wing back for a long time .
the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn &apos;t invite anyone but rather an early neo@@ conservative that the American flame follows the surrounding world : &quot; lady Liberty goes on .
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
reason@@ ably unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here .
the meaning of the statue is whole , and a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they see from the exhaus@@ tible , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope , and the welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , Miller and tr@@ ump ever wanted to recognize .
their tor@@ ches shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power , infl@@ amed .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK Teams
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schot@@ t belonged to the UK team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , Neil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special in Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics Men : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle from the team became a team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was very natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth of silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 Schot@@ t are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ range of Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another s@@ otte , which is one of the great season that saw the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games , was watching .
he remembers her first World Championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European capit@@ alists says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not belong to the team but in some cases , also with medals and fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special to remember that they were elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and voted to make me something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Schot@@ t who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athl@@ ets , athletes who want to climb on poker .
what my speech is concerned as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s simply going to be a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : do not take a public office if you don &apos;t have to toler@@ ate the voters of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long until the newspapers beat him because of all , from the home policy up to his political principles .
he im@@ pregn@@ ated with criticism , safe .
but he did not put his critics on silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and dum@@ b , we become like sheep for the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more than Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted it on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained that this week was the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ement dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and playing his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the govern@@ ement and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of cast or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ amm@@ ing people who win@@ ches the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the actual people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest asked the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ filled but she asked to hate hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I insi@@ sted that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment@@ ator of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people on the same subject , they will be regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a great group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the govern@@ ement as &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ Attack , &quot; would call others &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors to collect and burn prot@@ esters , or bring prot@@ esters to silence .
but exactly that happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ains by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised the First A@@ round ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they proclaimed a elec@@ torate of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time Washington had a similar effect on the Internet at the time of Washington .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters p@@ ens on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
petitions that critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
former European Patent No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his praise with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he laid this place .
he is an eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won the European tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came back to the European Senior Tour following his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more , when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ Captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Schot@@ t on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance fee is free , the parking costs £ 5 a car with a car and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds going to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking at lung cancer .
in this result , scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come into a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates , 167 lung cancer sei@@ z@@ ure are attributed to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said study leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer sei@@ zu@@ res for passi@@ v@@ rau@@ d a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections refer to as very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are more reason@@ ably priced at the time , &quot; as the head of the building was Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the house of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground there is much worse , which is not indicated in the plans .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a cooker .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the stolen cris@@ p with sin@@ cer@@ ous , un@@ washed hands are taken and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also takes her daily work , e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room is used as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work is dangerous : most men are unemployed , and many are drinking heavy , and there are soldiers .
&quot; no one sees it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua New Zealand , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement which touched the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observ@@ able .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea were the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive away from car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo sho@@ ots , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated hou@@ set@@ ops , which were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow tones .
only a few Indon@@ esians made their journey here , there were journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points on her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua , Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst pedi@@ atri@@ ots and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua wooden resources has an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these rich@@ ness , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for Papua New Guinea , who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military is a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military officers and units between 1998 and 2004 were paying almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars at a single officer .
pap@@ an demands after larger autonomy , these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists more than 500,000 Papua New Zealand have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970 @-@ 1920@@ s were made to commit genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region .
&quot; we Bec@@ ome Everything &quot; is in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane International in 2016 , where reports about atro@@ cities are included in the year 2016 , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture ; rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim business mig@@ rant from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ local native to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua New Guinea &#91; the women &#93; of Papua New Zealand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke of ine@@ qualities and legal injuries in Papua 2014 during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter was 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua New Guinea , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the locals have che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expec@@ tation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai died only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ on@@ ese soldiers broke out on a motorbike through darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took refuge in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifice and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers hum@@ bled into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore crushed hunting bu@@ ds and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago stem .
some demonstr@@ ators began to dra@@ g@@ fy stones in police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command of an internal radio : &quot; when the masses make more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not been released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Fort@@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the sphere came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and seek his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries out many Indonesian only one name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the che@@ er spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure their station &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ ss to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to be filtered by the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for families of victims of victims and gay , to go to the historical resi@@ du@@ es in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 , that he set out an outside mechanism for sett@@ ling the historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke at the 5th of June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said , he did not have any plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua New Guinea .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths of independence in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already cured in Papua New Zealand , including the P@@ ani@@ ai case .
families of P@@ ani@@ ai &apos;s victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers un@@ belie@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I was afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the slides have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police attacked the vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man in the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children too .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was sitting in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police told that the vill@@ agers threw stones to officers , who re@@ acted out , fired warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ on@@ esian paramil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured parties have been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hid two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon this to withdraw the officers of account@@ ability and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always a mad@@ man for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Guinea .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claimed to defend the rights of Papua New by pushing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ on@@ esian troops .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people were arrested in P@@ ani@@ ai and was arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never emerge again .
among the people in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here put everything they eat : especially not@@ ebooks , fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women that can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a are only 10.000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between native Papua New Guinea and the new migrants who have arrived in major numbers since the opening of a new flight to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region , generally to the better trained and weal@@ thy immigrants .
Papua have rarely the capital , or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of P@@ ani@@ ai &apos;s headquarters .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua New Guinea .
in addition , limitations of international media remain ten@@ sion@@ ed .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaigns to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua New Zealand and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various &quot; different violations &quot; in Papua , including P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to negoti@@ ate the evidence of human rights sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
people want to know more , that more foreign governments do this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the session but anonymous .
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019 , but they say that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military , is in poor educational and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua New Guinea , sees her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Shi@@ uss@@ ing victims led a last symbolic act of the de@@ fi@@ ance : the bodies of a victim was buried in a terrain precisely against the police and the military station .
they may know that , perhaps , no justice will come , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a strong head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;@@ sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest dormitories of the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ rise , which is called by coinci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant that called his name as George An@@ off , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ a Civil Protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may have questions about the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ scale buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the disgu@@ ise , the out@@ fit for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police told her that the system of plates to isolation and clothing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is a meeting with its major Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
during the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five set classics remain the traditional value .
6@@ 3.9 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only barely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ographic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ g@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the valu@@ ables .
but not only for the vote , after many attempts before the proposal entered the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the first round .
to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements in training places , etc . facil@@ it@@ ates and the players will need to complete fewer official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers brings forbidden items into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among flying objects showed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items to the control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which rates the plane while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed , they had to be er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey among more than 1,000 persons - representing a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules .
of the respondents agreed that they attempted to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of the generation X .
the most common items that have been deliberately tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent gave medical objects with clin@@ ching on security control , whereas 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said , I questioned trav@@ ellers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ low goods carried out through the flight safety and how many things would have done .
it is no surprise that people who wear the most popular s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly goods - wit@@ t@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by safety , those were the most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA policies are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain what liquids may take away , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of conf@@ isc@@ ated items seized by the T@@ SA .
for a time , people think T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you a huge number of reservations for his new Tesla Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ min@@ ed that some of the clients have already withdrawn their committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a second , less smoo@@ ther figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in the past months , Mus@@ k was frequently advertis@@ ed with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition begins .
now , Mus@@ k was dre@@ aming of a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders and 6@@ 3.000 already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that it is only about non @-@ committ@@ al reservations .
if cancelled , Tesla paid the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently 45@@ 5.000 such non @-@ committ@@ al reservations , spatial muscle in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , some twelve percent of all orders might be used to be a problem , however , the Tesla boss believes not .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
it is expected to be taken together - all models - 500.000 its , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 25 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla managed to get its brand new , never in practice tested in practice without greater breaks with maximum occupancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the non @-@ binding may be a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot afford un@@ satisfied customers to get away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s in due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , had his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved the needs of national environmental authorities on re@@ ac@@ tions@@ faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his prior position in a Federal Appe@@ al Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about a deadline that ran for states on October 1 , to keep the standards of 2015 for floor @-@ floor o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would carry out the compliance with a year to study the plan more time to study the plan and to hin@@ der itself in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly over to block regul@@ ators or delay the chemical industry and the industries of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal refund for the down@@ fall of the roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Justice has decided that the EPA Administrator has passed its authority as he tried to prevent the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reducing me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards just hit the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then maintained , by activists groups and others , and in an agreement negotiated for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation of jurisdiction , and we take it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority , which gives us , seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually gained its &quot; satisfaction to delay and all other legal available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; is based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
one last month of approval bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the intervention was not set to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , led the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their churches , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; 750 Jahre St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mountain Church &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the old cemetery @-@ area of Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a seren@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and pat@@ rons of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i is empha@@ sized : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ gy small i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ th document , Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ ble Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the Word document , according to the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the first parish church , there was also a glorious yard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , along with the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the gorgeous sett@@ ling of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ score this historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right originated from the early medieval commercial law .
a lord who built a church built and occupied with a minister , still remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit this y@@ ol@@ enk@@ ir@@ che also .
thus , it was the right to dep@@ loy a minister or the Bishop of a new minister .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater part of the two zer@@ os at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Church is broken .
only the steep@@ le had been made .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm attacked the storm and half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as a successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the organis@@ er invite friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery for the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo des Kepler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
the outskirts of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
for extinction of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk front of the cemetery takes place .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers now discover the fantastic views .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers aim to support many supporters for the receipt of historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ors and horns .
the friends and supp@@ orter of tum@@ ours are particularly committed to the home of care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ Organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim hon@@ ou@@ reth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not look any legal requirement for building and therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; hon@@ ou@@ reth &quot; the Council of Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentrate has existed .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible , at the same time , the focus zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
as a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided to have a second wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but they had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district of Düsseldorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the missing legal requirements , the granted approval of approval is illegal and therefore to increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council has once approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval from the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place the division of approval for the construction of wind power plants should be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion , to verify the matter again .
however , they do not mean that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of ongoing procedures at the administration court , the circle on Thursday did not want to content to the reas@@ oning of the Society &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company was involved in which the City of Vier@@ sen has been medi@@ oc@@ ese in which the owners of about 65 hectares of land is closed .
with the establishment of the four wind power plants , the power demand for around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the power requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , four wind turbines were the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg circle .
car and tractor together : woman dies with terrible accident
on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock in the L 333 , one terrible traffic accident is well @-@ suited to the L 333 ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) on Friday morning .
a woman was wounded in fatal .
two more people were slightly hurt .
the state road was closed over hours .
after police reports a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich ended with her car in the context of the accompanied vehicle with her 53 @-@ year old mother as a companion , the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to discover shopping in the city center in September .
the Trade Association and the City Council want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for shopping spre@@ e in the city center .
as the chairman of the commercial committee , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend is supposed to be sensitive , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
this is also a market with regional providers , similar to the market market .
also , native companies to present their apprentic@@ es@@ hips are also present .
moreover , the shops of the city center will invite to &quot; mit@@ ternal @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the action is not only in inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots in the radio , a internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial organisation cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the business club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offers as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with a selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and work to move it to active participation .
attractive offers to Saturday and the quote on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer should be new or rebuilt .
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but many locals have lost the city centre when shopping was lost .
at the end , all would have to contribute to the city center - to land@@ lords , the farms of the whole city and clubs .
it was to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gie which was partly spread , king in the spring had said .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , divided the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities .
in addition to the bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ ck@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be added to the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the church of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the suspension of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can even influence its shopping environment itself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US @-@ school
during work , it came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the US city Minneapolis there are two people killed and nine were injured , some of them seriously .
according to the fire brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) still a missed in a critical state .
a person died when a part of a school building fell in the explosion .
first Ver@@ mis@@ eries was also found dead later .
among the dead it was employees of the school .
as a mis@@ leading cause , the authorities suspected work at a gas pipeline .
only a few people took place in the building of the Min@@ er aha Academy .
ump @-@ coated by telephone calls on telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to stop public publicly that he would not pay for a planned border dam .
the US president dra@@ gged him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and gay , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first accus@@ ation with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a connected exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; would like to make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; when he proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call when he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in the countryside Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood up with ri@@ gs to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
the silence , when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one reproduction .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience beat out very genuine sigh@@ s .
since 2005 , civil rights for Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an died in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted because of the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization &apos;s organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a Life of Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
for him , the appointment as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ utions , we want the end , we want healing , we want to reconc@@ ile , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not come to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial field puts a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents that were received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot since decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court rendered a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia for the first time to give her voice in the summer .
about the same time as the choice went according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said that the rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she bore , did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free Malcolm from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to jail .
but when they were taken away from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b crossed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , there was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosec@@ utions that was not only involved in the murders , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more pre@@ dat@@ able .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ens led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , stra@@ pping and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and yet more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with his fi@@ del@@ ity in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - entered into a room and l@@ ur@@ red as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ ders for years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story at life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he , swe@@ pt away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a hur@@ ts the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said still ki@@ osk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back at that time &apos; n --- &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of another black performer .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy shifts in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ship replacing the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is beginning again .
this time , if Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repe@@ ating ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a tragedy , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs cheap Holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught the sweat and tears out of his eyes .
the audience is split between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have almost eight hours long Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture if Broo@@ ks it on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you took place on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels t@@ ailed .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to insp@@ ect the crowd and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks to the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w is surrounded by Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the sound member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional load of the performance breaks down with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she whis@@ pered one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience gets together with actors for dinner together .
at a table chat a white pair of Atlanta shi@@ fted through the night with a black pair that they &apos;ve just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski started to find words what feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you yourself and they do that , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does that do with me makes me think that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks farm in his table , he eats and remembers the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we suffer , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so , if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth

later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe .
it ow@@ es the audience with a strong applause .
being stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and bowed his hands to Merkel @-@ smokers .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again .
with tension , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was expected .
in 2013 he had to leave a f@@ law of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concer@@ to pass over itself , there were five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rowing went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in front of the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view@@ point .
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteers .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture unit , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I was already working on the open day at school .
how are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I made high school education .
and then a building engineer , we say , successfully ab@@ orted .
I recognized it for me that it is wrong for me and I want to make something else to work with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
take a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different purposes during the volunteer work ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s always coming on where to make the FS@@ J .
you can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was the right thing I &apos;ve been irrit@@ ated .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really expi@@ res .
unlike in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about to count as st@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people in mind that have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always go on it individually .
very interesting .

EPA returns to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of Obama administration that are obliged to in@@ dem@@ ise the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions , after 15 states accused the Agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA that should be measured in a part of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where entries must be made to keep a stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint against Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental impacts that imposed former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature reserves , who concerns concerned about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and enh@@ ancing respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
Municipal Council wants a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ voices , the Municipal Council decides to set up the establishment of a joint room in the future retirement system .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the contract for the still missing basic part was signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still will take place until the church community is owned by a private investor , there is no more planning to develop a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would be a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council so@@ ars such a common room , not as meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the church .
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; made the turn .
the decision will be missed due to providing funds for the current budget last autumn , by convey@@ ing possibilities .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint area would be , so T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible .
the decision to sign@@ alize in order to sign@@ alize the investor that in this regard , no tu@@ pp@@ le between the legs dis@@ likes that both saddle - what is le@@ aning on the surrounding area - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the pitch and the construction of economic power - that would be possible .
need@@ less , it does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he happens the panel .
it is not so easy with the common room .
Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you are not going to go right now , for it is now in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I do so hard to do that . &quot;
Y@@ vonne stadium really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on assets or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no access , but get a real , in doubt @-@ market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s application , given resolutions accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains with two counter@@ parts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ises : &quot; if we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a huge ride to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z of Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this plan the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there has been a planet track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ ring path &quot; will come to the information need of many har@@ z@@ al visitors , whose name was .
he is linked to nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route tables and inform about stars and star photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acc@@ essible installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning to reach five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in question St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets will be comple@@ mented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star trail train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path the viewer experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association .
they also learned why star would have different colors , or why a star even lighter than another , though it is much further away .
also , in which constellation can be found in a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been running since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , situated on the highest lying observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
the location is in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda @-@ galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
there have been something similar to the Uni @-@ City Initiative since 2003 at the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen , similar to the planned star value .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet ends with its st@@ akes up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the boards with the individual planets - including the under the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters diameter , while the sun measures approximately 75 meters away , while the sun measures approximately 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the total distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light of the sun is required until Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fix@@ ion would take a half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia who stand in a coll@@ ision course , to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia the un@@ covered World Bo@@ xing Council is light @-@ weight champion , the hall went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ed champion .
following Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you going to Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock in ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate noted that a possible show@@ down among the struggles would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I have increased for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to click on light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it &apos;s to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make a date on a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the same interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked after him , &quot; said Garcia and pushed hard to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said , he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might be able to participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he was thinking of River@@ side champion from River@@ side . &quot; I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to hear the Ko @-@ From . &quot;
Garcia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the moment@@ um that was building up for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work with , &quot; said Garcia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have waited for the top fighter , and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injured ty@@ re fl@@ ushes
during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously wounded during the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost at 16.@@ 30 in front of the market , probably after a ty@@ re @-@ burst , control over his vehicle .
the passenger car was h@@ itting right into the bu@@ stle , where he left himself and then remained on the roof of the Grün@@ streifen .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured parties , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left crossing will be passed by the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ vial chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the season 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener , that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points is possible .
with the first seasonal game And@@ re Hoffmann was happy with the result , the two opponents wouldn &apos;t have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two contra@@ sts too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e nor better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the triple chain should also be improved .
and a fool after a fre@@ ak@@ age want to un@@ fold more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is in preparation for the experience in preparation with the thresh@@ ing chain better than with the quad@@ erk@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we can inter@@ act in au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we just have in the triangle on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pre@@ condition but that we are even more harmon@@ ious and we do not afford such a lot of play@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can speak after a mis@@ de@@ dly start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will surely be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t want to know his coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I first took after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony had to be broken down due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e may even be some fresh , since they could not have heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter Favor@@ it on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we leave them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat out of fore@@ ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to definitely experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published
the recent findings of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Re@@ fin@@ ed F@@ inal@@ s@@ et ) has started with the execution of tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should be more precise during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised because of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , which were under age .
today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 880 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency shared that the person was &quot; perhaps 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no great difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the sub@@ ordin@@ ated person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the results of the 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , which are made in X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measuring should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age to assess this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it surely , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being an adult inde@@ er is in@@ correct .
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are going well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of emphasis on the bridge was installed at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in time , it goes super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the department of road and traffic in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time at all three refurb@@ ishing bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a bo@@ vine bridge made of concrete , which is clothed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges introduce the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge folder .
this is an edge attachment , which is also used as a factory route .
the southern part of the bridge will be set on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge folder .
it is supposed to run the pedestrian walk@@ way .
the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented breasts .
special finger@@ tips has the installation of lines due to the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs on the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bri@@ ck@@ les amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t matter what parties pull at a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to bring to a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that shows the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell for a poster &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who already have a few hours before the event , do not want to listen to AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the town @-@ pic@@ nic was originally planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well @-@ place , but it takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could even eat the AF@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is just a few meters from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D actually come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes by the AF@@ D Vol@@ can@@ es were reported that he had to stri@@ ve for such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially had been asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of which already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking available .
so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the case : at 20 o &apos;clock the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Young .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses , and they will eat it to the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart frank@@ ly openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I get into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately became bitter .
despite all this , the brunette performer against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve updated .
or do you think about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave up that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived with du@@ alism and believed seriously .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I &apos;ve never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
particularly among them , they suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school time she would prefer to dress like a b@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really was hurt me .
when I was eleven , my children said , I would look like a b@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and disappointed .
now I look back and think of myself : &apos; girls &apos; , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public she doesn &apos;t love to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and it anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and maybe I call myself some und@@ ank@@ able but I don &apos;t like to justify the public before all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and much thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not Hillary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the State , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he has coal mines in five States , and have inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday night gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather go back than to work out to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gover@@ ness and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is not able to find a positive , detailed message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world &apos;s global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country back to the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the eve of the athle@@ tics Championships on the eve of the athle@@ tics Championships that was correct in the sport and that he decided to fight d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let them be sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were swe@@ pt at competitions Gold@@ - and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments approved the IA@@ AF Congress for maintaining the prohi@@ bitions that happened in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) not@@ ices were found on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress was pleased that the Russian Federation was aware that they have experienced a few hot times and everything is possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the wi@@ thered system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which start Friday in London on Friday , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden coach are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
head of mourning for Mali di@@ pped soldiers
in a funeral ceremony at the northeast Frit@@ z@@ lar about 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter desc@@ ending in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high safety arrangements .
to the un@@ resolved crash , the Secretary of Defence said Ursula from Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
they described the two um@@ erable pilots , but as &quot; C@@ ön@@ ner of their expertise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they declared in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were living in the West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their graves were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a total rise of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the members were par@@ ting at the church .
after that , the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Secretary of Defence Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grapes rose roses , the relatives stood by arm in arms to the hem .
before the Church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defence from Ley@@ en called the Umbri@@ a soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and fl@@ atter .
the Stab@@ ili@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his Regim@@ ent .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have missed . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en showed not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral celebration , the S@@ är@@ ge were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are attacked , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no tomb beside his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife by his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish king &apos;s hair is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already served a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen was to agree with her husband &apos;s decision , and it was stated in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
he went into retirement in 2016 and puts the title &quot; Prince of Prince . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself not as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be , it is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
Mar@@ gre@@ the Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always imp@@ elled , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of rainy days .
in a Aut@@ obi@@ ography out@@ dated Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sil@@ k stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ge , which I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and who had to be the call to be the brand of social critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not trust in regard .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
that were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because the Parliament turned out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony &apos;s government in Lower Saxony was the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the election code , the red @-@ green coalition lost their cra@@ cker One @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded their step by non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend its group to record them .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag is officially elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ar@@ ler said that the red @-@ green government government had to decide whether they could continue to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , keeps it indispensable to solve the country &apos;s day as quickly as its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state of state also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister , draws up the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ um@@ ni said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ar@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ward step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politicians even stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a tra@@ der from black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the sec@@ ular par@@ liament@@ arians to return their Land@@ tag@@ and@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course of course that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at that she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; distributed the national president met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there were no content differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survivors of the Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of S &amp; Ds on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ choose the Land@@ tag quickly .
the exit of the West costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy of politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her injured vanity and their fru@@ strations for the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tried to beat out the political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ um@@ ler wants to recommend its members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career refle@@ xes the outcome of the 2013 country code .
the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest strength , SPD and Green , but a hau@@ gh@@ thin majority of one voice .
agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect us from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses more contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers and consumers who check the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amped pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
the food supervision is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house immediately switched off immediately , and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s suffer@@ ings are in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
trade has just like the manufacturers to worry , that the sold products are traffic and health un@@ think@@ able .
if in eggs the resi@@ dual content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the ag@@ rituris@@ mi to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after hand @-@ standing knowledge the production companies does not meet immediate guilt .
rather , they need to reck@@ on because of the alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , there is too little control in the harvest .
does it only lack the staff or even on the hose jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy may never be 100 percent excluded .
for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and over @-@ handed over to the offices in the cases where off@@ ences can lie , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times already , that I am expecting from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and secure food exclusively .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer and consumers are entitled to right .
by the same means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are given into a situation , which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ de Fi@@ bra@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ making animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistently implemented on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact will be swi@@ ft@@ ly and l@@ ayed .
how to move to Paris &apos;s financial rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules they aim to prevent un@@ paid expendi@@ tures of the European football matches will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
some consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA Cup , because the leading organization that the European game monitors the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by UEFA into life in 2011 , means that PS@@ G has to point in some point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without significant losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money easy with security , making N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich mist@@ y family of Qatar .
Ver@@ eine may apply to a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to the UEFA Presi@@ dency in 2007 .
the former French player thought that Ver@@ eine , who had taken out enormous debt in their quest , effectively frau@@ dul@@ led and ris@@ ked to ru@@ ding , if banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debt of clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the change meant that the business model used the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally bought in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and to build a global brand - a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini fell from the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be en@@ chan@@ ted by excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will enhance the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the FF@@ P , against The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat @-@ shell , it may distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years to be paid in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G was a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season took place on 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players will be limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list her financial institutions by joining them by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ chy company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market rates , UEFA won &apos;t be considered a legitimate income .
this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority was pu@@ ffed up .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments will come to N@@ ey@@ mar over the payments of the World Cup in Qatar in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 will be cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Ambassador will be simply to find out a major man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that UEFA is still more attentive to consider any attempt to avoid the rules .
UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , told the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity using The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not fu@@ elled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot operations .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s directions by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ i the official owner of the PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed completely the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new og@@ gi@@ ore supplier

according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to try out a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018 .

the comedy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , announces a folded TV series : a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main cast - a hard @-@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags behind the view ( the police gives the time to view themselves chess in TV , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of the famous spokes@@ man - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan mask - is often referred to as a single .
there is six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , could provide his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who devour a he@@ ap ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the Embassy for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ tional Romanian Creator is not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ oods .
blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , like the public prosecutor Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and had been issued for arrest war@@ rants .
the officials ordered greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two persons were arrested during the same raid in Italy .
there were German arrest war@@ rants against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug criminal , violent violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
already since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office Con@@ stance against the organised drug dealers in the southern German room .
between the offices in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an extended exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the large deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the sight of the investigations , the Italian nationals were in relation to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident on the 27th of May in Hü@@ fingen , fired several shots to a restaurant at the morning , should go to the account of the gang .
thus compl@@ ains great g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner register has significant lack of short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
the Federal Government for Refu@@ gee Management in the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , according to a media report , according to large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s country register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data may lead to asylum procedures and shifts &quot; to partly engraved mis@@ decisions , &quot; in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the register , there are reported to be ten million people with foreign nationality , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany .
because the data was not well maintained , the data quality would not have been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and not to emerge in the register . &quot;
&quot; f@@ law@@ ed data input may significantly slow down processes , &quot; says the report .
in the statistics about foreign trav@@ ellers , the EU citizens exist , who would not have to travel out .
but these false assign@@ ments led to a dis@@ closed debate on how to deal with trav@@ ellers &quot; means it is in analysis .
meanwhile the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is out of an internal paper on migration and refugees ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such methods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation was on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU @-@ government officials responsible for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the immig@@ rant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the entrance capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these comm@@ itments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokesperson on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatening due to lack of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ard of childhood . &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons already exhibited for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens received by Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now sold 100 litres of blood in the meantime , sold 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the church rests in the meeting of the Municipal Council to don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous how our body is designed and we are available for the don@@ ors that their blood is available for strangers , nor un@@ even un@@ profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are crushed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ors .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that are carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the theatre &apos;s house had a few years ago to pay higher participants .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would have fought over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when they contribute to family interest rates in the middle of a reinforced pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing .
in its quarterly inflation forecast the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and anticipated that the pressure on household income would continue to continue , whereas inflation in autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit cards would possibly have to rise more than expected in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut of Mamm@@ ut , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will call time for the financial plan to deliver more funds for banks , although it is expected to be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of Sterling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the rate of interest , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the real households will continue to reduce consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain degree of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be required as the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , empha@@ sized that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limits . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are anticipated by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to May in May .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have been strug@@ gling for interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easily re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and a lower level of salary , because the tigh@@ ter is still worse before they are improving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate in part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision made a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will reach the prices and economy .
prior to the last verdict of the Bank on the interest rates , the call was increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard forced households , with three political decision makers in July increased to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said that this was expected , and it will come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that aims at the ratio of 2 % to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak Po@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ enh@@ o , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent review of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , because the lending service is still looking for businesses and want to end in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those with whom the existing de@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub a controversial HIV drug to fight 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment from September after a fight against financing the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk @-@ risk assessment by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service on a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he was ready to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , according to the Pr@@ EP , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should fund him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday announced chess train was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the application of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV supplements which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced to the HIV transmission in infection .
p@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual and persons with HIV positive partners that were not successful successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are registered in England and registered with a specialist doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic .
the program is called £ 10 million and N@@ HS England , signed a contract to supply medications in this week after an international competition .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by adding clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale , absorbed and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the vast and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in ensuring one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV Epi@@ de@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ating with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forms this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in the society take a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have changed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker in a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne did not sell their bags packed and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a emb@@ ell@@ ed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous deck height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she instructed the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to make a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , to resolve the provision .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were st@@ acked together without g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about to build a simple platform , but put the steel so that he had the right height above or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ ke plays a role when adding theater , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer .
in the kitchen the spi@@ der feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ eg@@ led units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
so the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is equally important , so when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they managed to increase the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that provide the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; don &apos;t love you into electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform themselves through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something quite aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this one .
brothers struggle for a 500 million US dollar real estate
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how its property and its business is to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
the West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her father &apos;s father Colin - Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one third .
a judicial states that this means that Colin owned the value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was left by Colin proposed performances , which I held for the best objects in 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday after several failed attempts .
the brothers also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claimed it was exp@@ elled .
Colin argued that this is not true , but raises Paul , to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to teach the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held in law .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rant , the dairy bars and dol@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ ary business from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties , in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ charge of the family .
Colin says that he began to West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was yet a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis company group , with Colin claimed that Mark was paid $ 10 million by acqu@@ iring $ 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke , as well as Mark , says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become im@@ bit@@ tered over the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made himself very restra@@ ined , although he was a member of the AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire as the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered with SMS to say &quot; I can really not say a lot , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me , and to complain about our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t desire that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was still a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico tells that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orters Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of Staff of the White House , met in his first working day with senior employees , he set a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wants to repair : poor information that will be given into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
cellar &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitor his meditation .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps Relationship went back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong .
&quot; if the candidate of Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended due to un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to pol@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cians Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officers , ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these fighter officials know something we don &apos;t know other - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets still contain more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff had made it too many times , anger from him , then their efforts have been paid .
but no one has failed to prevent tr@@ ump controversy .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting their own agenda by promoting its own views from the world .
poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of consultants , pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing strategic reasons of strategic reasons .
this was an example of described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press lines , especially those with dam@@ aging lungs , and that he may find out to find out what these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused the first copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be &quot; in the White House . &quot;
even though Johnson was banned from Twitter because he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people over Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us but tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the mission very difficult .
chis@@ elled criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the people will pray and hoped .
the Police enters the whole of Europe this summer ( virtual ) postcards with dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of selected s@@ words are not known , notes from the population will be hoping and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Ad@@ vent@@ ine calendar from the winter .
the experiences have been shown that many of the volatile destinations will hide themselves , it was named by Euro@@ pol .
more Post@@ cards have been selected for 21 postcards covering from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ searched could have been arrested , at least eleven of them based on publication after the release on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some more determined trav@@ ellers on the foot of the church , which have negotiated a field before their man@@ ners .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire range . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army from transport , after being thrown out in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated gra@@ bs in order to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they came there on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath , where they threw stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced through shame on the implementation , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were in May there , have been moved and are now back again .
more happened yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to manage to protect their parks in order to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am walking on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common tax , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a natives who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an in@@ fu@@ cked camp on the country beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ d@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps , so that they continue as quickly as possible .
in order to support our we@@ aving collection , it is very important that as many people are calling a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we suggest our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the then ambient operation Company mbH for 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights had lost a year and also proceeds by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , faced with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came into the County , the hotel building offered as a collection accommodation , which was designed for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by adding a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not in@@ controversial then at the time .
but before all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said already by serious interested parties at the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ iers acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ites and one in Bad men@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn off , blank@@ ets partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
rooms are equipped with large @-@ mounted showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are fitted .
everything should be pretty close to &quot; beautiful bourgeois society , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
there is no need to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , empha@@ sized Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , set up broad , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual tourists , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led interviews with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city be covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to define exactly exactly .
almost under a million euros , it pays .
the out@@ lines are also brought to front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Represent@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special medi@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in the past weeks , the panel recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal with the cause of confi@@ dential persons .
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded his investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the station CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , oldest son and Russian attor@@ ney .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long , targeted targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were differences between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are aimed at the election campaign as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally hit the center and seek the accus@@ ation , whether the President in the course of the affair may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
mostly they are turned on if it is a larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the hearing under E@@ id .
according to the station CNN , pre @-@ charges have already been issued , which turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
people who were involved in the meeting were to be asked to be a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also , Tr@@ um@@ ps advisor and Schwi@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging election winner Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were with the interview .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the creation show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide about data collection .
nevertheless , the creation of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the examinations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president of Thursday took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign in his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the demo@@ cr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about that they can talk . &quot;
his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion that he knew nothing of the creation of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in the secret , he stressed .
the White House proc@@ laim any actions that accelerated the work of the special forces on &quot; fair &quot; ways .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this root accus@@ ations were turned out against Tr@@ ump , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President stands for the investigation , under large pressure .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
that dis@@ band@@ ed the spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is dischar@@ ged .
unlike a Independent Special Represent@@ ations of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller , Mu@@ eller , has a position in which he could be fired on behalf of the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators ordered the charges on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg running in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved itself from the scar@@ ce of Berlin &apos;s seven times .
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer long Kol@@ oss t@@ oss well to the North and will probably take two , three years until he is melted .
it has 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice@@ berg who have registered researchers in the last three decades .
a threat to people is not coming from him .
to what climate change has played a part in the collapse of the iron ore , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , there have been a series of unusual mer@@ ges in the region for approximately 30 years , writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background .
according to the opinion of many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the Kol@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ celebrated swimming pool on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aciers .
thus , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated is south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xes and break down several years ago .
a complete pist@@ ol is falling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ rav@@ els is in danger , because the front edge had never been withdrawn , as far as currently .
in addition , the ice sla@@ b stand under tension and can be broken , if there is a piece of a piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they swim in water and ice as much water as it gives to the melting itself .
however , the loss of the sh@@ el@@ ight also leads to the glacier directly into the sea , which can flow and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s is the fourth largest slaugh@@ tering of the Antar@@ ctic .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural thing and no direct connection to climate change is aware that the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eventh time will be back , and possibly go back , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher does not return the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ice@@ berg in the climate change , so in the past few decades , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are broken .
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
we contributed to the decline in the temperature increase .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed around three degrees in the past 50 years , and count towards the areas where the temperature is at the fastest sti@@ ff .
CD@@ U wants a skin rate when personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CD@@ U , from the employer association , calls to become more attractive .
just before the summer break there was 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have behind their first working day behind .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought .
some 620 candidates were to be posted in places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is missing to meet the increased requirements and tasks .
currently there is a district of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 not occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and entered into the management of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the desire of the parties , &quot; a concept for personnel production and personal development work . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals but future @-@ proof of application short@@ ages , means it is .
the overall concept should be looking for inside and outside , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems which one knew not earlier .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age from the service comes out .
so , the highest time to act so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the joint request .
he had already been in the cra@@ w@@ day for a fat surprise when he publicly exhibited for the recruitment of personnel in question and the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , who enable a outlet from a municipal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not to come to a satisfactory solution here , the Kreis@@ administration building should go with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - such as peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better employees and officials to pay better than the public service for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , enh@@ ancing or more money there is only if you changes in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , land Council Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO mig@@ rant life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has warned NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue , if they do not keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , because whose crew had worked effectively with human traff@@ icking in a way that prop@@ elled illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express himself in the exec@@ ution@@ ers of the Italian national treas@@ ury Ambro@@ gio carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion of social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all charges that are collected at present , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , monitored since October .
it is believed that his crew is delivered on board @-@ boat immigrants , which can be delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can leave , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these comm@@ utes took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the crew is suspected to susp@@ end on the authority of Italian coast guards who monitors rescue rates in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats have to have boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , especially an Italian police officer , who monitors its activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue sets have been ready to hold in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they wouldn &apos;t bring &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is among those who refuse to sign .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy have declined sharply in the last weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and co @-@ operation with the local civil master fruits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan Ci@@ tiz@@ ers in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Affairs &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Sea to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and tourist attractions .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ ong@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the peac@@ ock forest and the pre@@ valent levels .
in between , there was again longer arri@@ vals for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
again , look@@ out spot to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ bl@@ ge &quot; tri@@ as and moderate stimul@@ us .
many al@@ titudes were told at the last two days .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and gro@@ c@@ eries , welcomed P@@ ausen .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the Bik@@ ers in the free@@ wheel content cur@@ ing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest from its best - sporty and cultural - met .
console instead of La@@ wn - Bundesliga pic@@ ks for e @-@ sport
will the Sport stars in future sit in front of computer consol@@ es , rather than fighting through wind and weather over the stadium r@@ v@@ ens ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been to an increasing industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
they have also recognized the first federal law , which increasingly engage in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ sport division in mid @-@ July and two professionals working for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire a new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; that on this turn , some clubs can asc@@ end . &quot;
the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup at which the gam@@ ers compete in different clubs .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven quali@@ fies .
Robin D@@ utt can also see great potential in the e @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ olds that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the attempts to take all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets as only once a year the Federal Court to Asia .
what &apos;s it exactly ?
computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA for competition level will be challenged .
long ago , as in the normal sport , li@@ gen established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and e @-@ sport is already part of the official program in 2022 .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it also need cog@@ nitive skills , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only work on the console but also exercise their body and mind the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more . &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene failed the structures of the classic sports .
scientists empha@@ sizes the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international , that is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales of 130 million is expected .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
many countries have already been further .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez is participating at the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Co@@ ver inv@@ ests in the sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe too .

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , sentenced Conrad Roy to suicide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were abandoned .
Carter was sentenced to life in June for the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both them and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood up with tears in eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Prosecutor of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she did not assume responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which she was completely lam@@ ent . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will be able to carry with us for ever , to be for his sisters , &quot; it is therein .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she will be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; she will never be able to attend the wedding of her brother or a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this one person , with whom I had been together since my birth , is a pain that I will keep in my life forever with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call another , commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead by a carbohydr@@ ate pois@@ oning in 2014 .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters reveal text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging up , spring from a building , take yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent her death in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any news from the case .
the case shared the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 because of murder on their British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted on two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ved compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning about the new mini @-@ lame of FC Bayern
that Joshua hit the captain of the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence .
the FC Bayern comes with the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua felt immediately , even if the extra piece was very small , very small .
but since far and wide at the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course there was no Philipp L@@ lame , and no Manuel New to be seen , he made himself getting married B@@ inde to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner was after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one would have better run than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could interpre@@ t the signs of the coach too .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was made out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f had chosen as gaming guide , but he .
Su@@ gar is also a gift to those who want to do much , to those who want to keep you in a mood .
so if anyone has been chosen , the inheritance of lame can only be used , a little extra motivation can only be used .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ lame on the field .
at the right behind , this is his position , the white B@@ k on the arm did their rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me worked in this starting information as the one who can take the Ru@@ der on the best in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to handle the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore get out to get out on the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( it also works only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall into their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this is all fol@@ dable .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ itated su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely .
the renowned nap@@ oli @-@ storm often did so difficult , in addition , sweet@@ ness tried to have a couple of times succ@@ es@@ fully .
his colleague Rud@@ y conf@@ essed that the result was &quot; not so , as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance at the debut .
game inspection , speed change : &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot;
as un@@ familiar with this Bavaria @-@ Welt in the world , one looked after the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me passed after a few scar@@ ed statements on his new player &apos;s back .
there he listened to Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what goes down here I &apos;ve already noticed .
in Bavaria , you must simply win each game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one .

company content with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz minister : business pra@@ ises pace
it often designed in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and regional economy as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still a Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than one year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T @-@ demand for a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ els at the same time the old ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing is attacking the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ on has blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the country sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the close connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 is supposed to be the construction right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans are also playing the West Bank of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aim is to take the route in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Minister of Transport Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees there a sign for regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) moved to Trier , making a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
I also have an open ear for people who want to establish a own company , the I@@ HK pra@@ ises .

but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .

Frank Nat@@ us is also awaiting a concept of the country as it wants to resolve the skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broadband building in the country .

Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - a car manufacturer confron@@ ted with a counter@@ action
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to prohi@@ bit or limit the diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the company described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , apply as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers to install neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases by diesel vehicles , also take up what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of conce@@ aling the powerful auto@@ contractors to ignore the problem of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the Volkswagen mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreciation devices that have been tested to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but drive back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen when the authorities accused Audi to use a system installed to handle the legislation in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could make Volkswagen heavy duty : the luxury car manufacturer carries propor@@ tion@@ ately to win the Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los dum@@ b@@ ays and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published cartoon animation , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ini@@ er still records and works in a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there are too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked among other things as a sign of congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris in the end of the 60s of the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artists of the towns have always been inspired .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort yourself in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is still sitting in the drawing book today , working every ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks find its threatened figures continue to spread much spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in its drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ fold than def@@ ender .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , which should come to the chin @-@ up in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he puts more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is not power@@ less .
lavender from Provence , threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ ender is rec@@ alled due to drought conditions and related insects , which avo@@ ids scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , big head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , the expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change during the past few years , and much more rain in the spring .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lavender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden ski@@ pped , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .
lavender oil does not only fish for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered , belong to a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dry .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the weekly paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting over the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 .
security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal pain .
there are drug ding@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the walking list of the government or the cart@@ el , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest from violence , and during all the country the bodies are frequent : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing according to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter is their editors and their in@@ spir@@ ator from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , bear T @-@ shirts , that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian .
the workshop takes less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though , in 2010 , a special Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General was built to form the cases of journalists , according to the report to the Protection of Journ@@ alists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug dealers and organised crime , the journalists are rarely put on trial by journalists .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally east and although the terrain is still tra@@ ced .
without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we miss all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the theme of Val@@ dez is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t make anything that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug , who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , presum@@ ed Gang@@ hi@@ on@@ ers bought each copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the capture of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the same story to leave the country in its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues draw that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 USD particip@@ ations .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without using the poison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard tre@@ ading examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else had to treat .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committees for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , where she has gone .
he gave himself up to fear that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; you must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of many things ? why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who could curse like a harbour workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice was a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ an@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and sitting there on the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions in question as they do their work on the best and to stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ suffici@@ ency and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be du@@ ped ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
the old rules as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer apply - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where people met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce for security training came suddenly no cell phones allowed . days earlier became known that Spy@@ ware , who is sold exclusively on governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a large @-@ class residential neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in scher@@ z , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor himself as un@@ trusted .
it is months since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug attacks de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce arrived on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Chavez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the public spending which was concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened , so caution was enjo@@ ined when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orters learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , which belongs to the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ car@@ ving cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military assault .
only a few months earlier the readers would have viewed Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , to protest against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected - activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration on the office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists became aware of the whole country by using them in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; in terms of o@@ bedience and construction .
this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez &apos;s case .
in a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities to exp@@ ose journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth .
since then , she has asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that their rage has hurt their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug names , but also on orders of politicians and security forces organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you &apos;ll die because they want you hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
no one forget the death of the B@@ log@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as before six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by the Z@@ etas Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
one computer keyboard and ear@@ phones are next to their separate head .
some branches were elected , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez set publicly on the drug cart@@ el with a Editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z was murdered .
for those who continue to stay and continue to work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives the drug tra@@ ders frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became reporter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band rival and security forces near the swimming pool Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ assies in the region .
from the scre@@ ams , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens how@@ led near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
when they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day that Javier was murdered , the practition@@ ers asked me to send them on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used camoufl@@ age to depart from his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a sc@@ ary .
researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something from an &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the buried dinosau@@ rs which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered kind of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ este@@ emed condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio when he took place at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met something that was out of the surrounding rock , and decided to see more precise .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy petroleum .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Main Event Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that this plant fres@@ co@@ ater , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a bott@@ ling tank , probably threatened by the carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly woven dinosau@@ rs used a red and white camoufl@@ age to hide themselves before pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting , which is also used as a counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to leave his enemies , say experts , which suggests that there was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has first made headlines in May and now is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen was enabled to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the constitution , a widespread defence method in animal rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the Con@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the living animals survi@@ ves .
it suggests that the dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure through flesh e@@ aters of Dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution of confron@@ tation caused the confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the con@@ greg@@ ations - think about R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or belts - are much smaller and hurt as prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or @-@ behavior on a massive , strongly ge@@ aded dinosau@@ rs indicate how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was rot@@ ated .
scientists continue to examine the animal on critics above his life , including his fourth intest@@ ine to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs died when he died in a river , and sank into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because he is covered completely with con@@ ser@@ ene skin , but is also available in three dimensions and re@@ tains the original form of animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost as looks like in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need much imagination to design it . if you have only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , had passed the earth .
although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been liqui@@ dated after death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was found in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the retained @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle up to hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant fres@@ co@@ ater was w@@ asted through the western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater yield of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well received that the skin is still b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in the lot@@ to .
the more I ans@@ wo@@ e , the conf@@ using it will .
the remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates , which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed up .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass suspension on A8 : many injured
a severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass district .
there are numerous last , kilometers long st@@ out and g@@ aff@@ er .
the late Thursday afternoon at Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connections of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg district ) during a storm , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , including trucks .
there are no information about the exact number of injured parties .
there were light to moderate injuries , a police pre@@ ten@@ tion said .
a big adv@@ ent to rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the journey of Munich , a long history of ten kilometres was formed .
like a AZ reporter , it also occurred on the opposite way to massive disabilities - numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ices the characters of the vehicle @-@ glass , which now have been calculated with sensitive crimes .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing sits on the train and sleeps .
or one is ti@@ ft in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ el or tear off the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently testing the free ticket @-@ card control .
one has just been confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken place and used the ticket .
at present , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , wide we have it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many further travel routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the train the ticket evaluation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what &apos;s going to do already in most passengers .
it is also necessary to have purchased over the app by rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last@@ ly you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one rises in the train , call@@ eth his ticket among &quot; My tickets . &quot;
with the test customers then a button to the electronic discharge appears .
the train heads will receive a message that driving g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y Y .
if the tractor comes at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already used online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep further , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for rail - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without a ticket control through our train system , the DB navig@@ ator is easy to check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB Fern@@ traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot;
those who are often train , knows that in addition to delay and twi@@ sts , the ticket controls are among the greatest medical products .
for often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers don &apos;t know all the documents you need for use on online tickets .
either missing the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that you have to point .
the result are endless discussions between train heads and driving pleasure , which leads to a worse mood in the evenings or del@@ ays and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same circuit are not un@@ locked .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police killed just a 18 year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be his father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , secured another police officer and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return trip , and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she repeated their 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s home and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and loss of resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which she had many times in front of this morning , &quot; above the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ minded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even though I was lucky enough to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no ec@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different to the next black female child .
I feel the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them away from far . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority to a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Offic@@ ers Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner , who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted only to document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nourished by countless cases of people , often of White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought to the project closer together , along with six other locals did the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not around a Messiah guide , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most obvious participant of the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ tile life as she loves and married her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and human@@ kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls is repe@@ ating the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the year 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with various fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to observe that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ matic type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who shook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although she was at the fore@@ front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras have long disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the rac@@ ic connections between the church and the police continue to stand .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ oned to a singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she walked three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on onto the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is still not built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has folded the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the topic hardly can be cold .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit Gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Six ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery gives more customers to the city , of which the rest of the shops benefit , fear the enemy , that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
added : the gallery will be planned on the property , on which the farm market stands , which will offer 13 direct marketing products .
with the start of construction , it will end up .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a Square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost a week in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always happy again .
the but@@ cher was also discovered for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if you are direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , it comes to the height of the rent .
the new project is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough in our city .
you see how many shop@@ pers are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
but since it is not even a regular weekly market , it is more important that at least the market hall remains at least .
because at least the goods offered there is fresh , is offered largely directly from the producer and is purely inexpensive .
as you see , Lad@@ in shops can be rented in a shopping center just from larger companies , because the dor@@ f@@ ences are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farm market place during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or does it make a bit @-@ bit gallery to drive out all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs no one .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market there &apos;s a lot more - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
when the peas@@ antry is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost unpleasant - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks tubes and hair@@ cut , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysis took a 35 @-@ year sentence after she publicly made diplomatic reports about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2nd is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , created by Mann@@ ing , and if someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like somebody with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Bradley Edward II , but has been openly condemned to identify the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison it was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is deliberately sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and she we@@ ars a platinum blonde bar@@ g - with whom she has been associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and chew@@ ing gum by extracts the DNA from the waste to produce an image how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were added to un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ els , which took over several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ orted Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to convert a future in which the President Chel@@ ate &apos;s verdict would be to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison was a welcome kind of happy promises .
there are also some civil war and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths which he should actually fix , continue to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery written , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) at the end of the &quot; automatic spl@@ ashing , whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , like ast@@ o@@ unding similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition located in an own room is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with a release of hands in the hands of the discipl@@ ines of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they consider your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was expected in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of masks , of its own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , which were like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ es were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford
a nationwide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who have been searching as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acquisition of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several legs died .
a public warning system was published by the Chicago authority by the Chicago authority that the ly@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek after the two susp@@ ects , officials said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University in 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ n , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now in be@@ ur@@ ly and from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investig@@ ating by the relevant authorities and the North@@ western University is co@@ operated on this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cub@@ n said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man from the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and ready to help the US investig@@ ational authorities in any conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ rens colleagues were shocked and wanting to show himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of her residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which has just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 100@@ 8 had something happened .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the victim &apos;s time and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible domestic ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a specific stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA chassis was updated in this regard , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WA@@ DA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ introduction of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything , which could be a concern for Russia &apos;s occasion .
&quot; all has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved investigation by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to accept a state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation , since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has occurred .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales station r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v issues the problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main qu@@ arti@@ stry of Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared &quot; in the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has called people out of the outside .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of employees , it allows companies to provide surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to offer employees , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said they have a better insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows a look at a glance , which units have most complaints and which executives can have low @-@ performance results - so that you can pursue , why .
companies come to look at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not have the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , who has been published a blog post since then a former employee describes a blog post , with those who have spoken , punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business option .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year at the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
convert has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber registered recently as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Enterprise lets you send custom &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real @-@ time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can log in bad behavior .
and if the main business leaders are involved , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , workers @-@ flu@@ ence and lam@@ entation .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has convert Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find out a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the dis@@ comfort of employees .
now that the company convert Conver@@ cent may have problems that were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or less intern@@ ship faster and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are protecting our shareholders &apos; employment disp@@ utes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , because of ethical violations of the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty washing online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring of eth@@ ics , people used hope than a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t provide your software as a service , and strain the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , both supported both start @-@ ups .
convert $ 10 million for financing in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing up the whole capital to $ 47 million .
exhibitors secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that will feel their voices , and that work that you are doing , they feel stronger and committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ ders when its portfolio company run smoothly . companies run fine if employees are employed and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics Tools make third @-@ party promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee commitment after experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company has no measures taken .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly , or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you will have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting on Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have abandoned itself to the collection of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you do not care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who now runs monthly co @-@ surveys now , was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the employees , and it hopes that on long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA removes two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot objects and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these unlimited minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses are returning to their closing tests before they return next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings at the U@@ CL@@ A were to begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the players already completed .
the combination of the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should stay in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal play@@ grounds for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he will support the rule of N@@ CAA , even if they add the multi@@ busy routes of the players a further point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lay this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end up their practices , as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear view of its fields from an adjacent park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class which has already been raised with foot@@ balls which will be a protection network behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ ster , no easy task .
brood @-@ player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a compl@@ ained that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from going to think that people are going to rent a room and then draw up a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video band from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security staff on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I am not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit messages to fac@@ t@@ sp@@ urs of third parties and their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a position on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods in order to detect possible counterfeit messages , and to submit them to fac@@ ulty test , which may be displaying results of the original article in the original article .
Facebook has been considered one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political theme in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in May with false stories , and Germany should not be pen@@ alised after the social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted Post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories of fac@@ ten@@ ers are fo@@ ret@@ ched , people want to meet more context to make known decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to test the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes in his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Consci@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of one acc@@ ord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he thought un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter so re@@ acts that he was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always smell like smoke , for then a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as he would also be there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) it seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian chant , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ olo@@ ge@@ mon@@ ary buttons on the walls and bottles that have spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists , working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only full access in 2006 when the final adult , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , where Arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps that would like : &quot; one could mean that country @-@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to fight two families .
guys , let all go ahead ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to include the wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man that built the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot who joined the castle in 13@@ 80 , titled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmer &apos;s uprising began in this field and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers which hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , filled his own funeral by filling a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be rather difficult to make debt and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .

campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ an &apos;s Mari@@ tim in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ans@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started her campaign to launch a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan of the slogan .
at the end of August , there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of action went on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think it is ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on her yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we are the firm conviction that we know as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the promotion , it is more than just a &quot; logo and a slogan , &quot; it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a unique promises , one that makes the city a distinctive single feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ sized five @-@ digit amount can be found in Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f its new roof brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year , at the beginning of August , Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) is advis@@ able over pension and transport operations .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ President , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number of numbers .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
Commander of Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were set off .
since the failed cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan was fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire transfer .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately at the coup attempt , is committed in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day after the coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he give him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
in the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ fixing in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff , there were concerns of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which will manifest itself among other things in the up@@ lifting of the head ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the great cle@@ ans in the army and security forces are going on in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 state operator , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
thereby it seemed , as Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als are considered to be the real masters of the country .
three times , they were calling on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly stat@@ ute .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan ob@@ jected the power of the military step by step , not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan run specifically a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; a well @-@ known officer , who sought after the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , won the Turkish army in a few years , &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
meets this , Nato could not allow Nato &apos;s opposition .
in the alliance , there are doubts about pur@@ ging for the Turkish Army in the alliance .
the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he sees to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for a temporary employment permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages , and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the US will be spent in other countries by other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that are confident of our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to shuttle to the shuttle bus
over the past few months , over the future of the racing car sh@@ utt@@ les was fought - now it is expected to go fast .
even before the end of the year , the tourist route is expected to be built , built on the tourist route .
to ensure the future of the racing car sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the transport of the Ministry of Transport , this year , construction works will begin on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ g , the country conf@@ esses to this particular link for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the route contributed to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country take 75 percent .
the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be coordinated , stated in S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South African train as the operator had already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus , the timet@@ able , the cars and quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ Shuttle on December 2017 should be held regular .
the race track shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , the course of a pilot company has been tested , whether the range of sufficient many people is used to order them again in the future .
the track is also strong in parts .
the ascent of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , the shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver every quantity of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , who feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are att@@ ained by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select everything from the robot color of the robot via the shape of the chest to type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; Person@@ alities &quot; who would like to make a step@@ ford @-@ woman to be progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing as for example , for example .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who convey@@ ed the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so , they like what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this scen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ jec@@ tory female properties that goes on rape , if you encounter a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : contra@@ diction ) Far@@ rah is going to worry about most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
her emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jection as an optional en@@ core .
most men of course do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noticed their rising popularity , they still remain in the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ age from the boundary zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives them the permission .
there is a certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House , who pra@@ ises women sexually attacked .
the most striking aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the un@@ worn body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; Person@@ alities , &quot; the robot will not represent real women .
you cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
they have no inter@@ medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , suggest@@ ing independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jection .
expressed differently : they are fake slave .
or to express it in the direction of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy lives
it has become one Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of the tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. voters , also split families in small size .
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to cope with the horror of the dump .
we are all supposed to look forward to our filter bubbles .
the power Tr@@ um@@ ps , families , has been less noticed .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she re@@ minded me that the unity may have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with the ump in the White House , everyone knows whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to find the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his m@@ k@@ itt@@ ens will not get rid of one day .
however , there is still a frigh@@ tening @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , in the tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of failure .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s comic version of the decline - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach - the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild off@@ ence .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be physically healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of New York &apos;s parking department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music is a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will be old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of London - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ 1920@@ s can go on it and have a great time .
if I could have chosen the Kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing plus the option to balance your rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the table .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but does pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no required is required .
the poor woman in the department store was innocent , while I was tired of experience to rich my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us co@@ iled with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of un@@ circumcised in the hospital , according to his prison sentence , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder for murder , because of murder after an appeal .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s early morning in 2013 , giving it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , she is op@@ aque .
the National Criminal Code said that it will be ob@@ jection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when pe@@ asant Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the pe@@ ers from F@@ use and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were put away into the holidays and in the continued schools .
three of the Dis@@ miss@@ al students go to Gymnasium , four on the secondary school .
chief economist Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Mayor in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday night .
the 29 students of four classes , under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eag@@ les who grew up in the poultry , but then released in freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Adler in the hen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a notable egg , and left it out of his chickens .
instead of a chicken star there came out a small eagle .
but the hope of making a chicken , struck the eag@@ les , spread out its wings on a high hill .
after that , the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank made a chicken care .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder , around the bet .
the eagle stand for integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( cows ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wanted every quad@@ ran@@ sig@@ ent that he feels in his new school .
many thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps in teaching and par@@ liament@@ arians .
the coastal time is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the vier@@ lander .
finally , everybody left a song of summer time and holiday season .
there broke out great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ ups have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group will offer software updates to around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the exhaust emissions of emissions of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Car Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only for the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ armament is arranged by the Bundes@@ amt für Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a lasting implementation in the next months , but not yet called any exact date .
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write every affected .
if it is due to an inspection , that will be done in their frame .
how long shall the re@@ mun@@ eration in total go ?
&quot; to say &quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin thinks .
the Cur@@ tains of the manufacturer &apos;s engagement as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should this update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could it be to get an appointment .
what are mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ group ?
the ACE will wait for waiting .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving bul@@ ations are threatening .
in the rural space there has been no securities for older diesel .
the ACE will not wait to wait with a sale .

we &apos;re making the city li@@ ve@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the passage is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ ed in the press .
he reports from varied but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , at the same time , no application gives the requirements profile .
the city looks at the nearest point of an architect , or engineer engineer .
so - under the contemp@@ t of regular intervals - still enough time for a preparation .
da Has@@ lach acts for the administration community as a sub @-@ purpose authority , the applicant must be submitted to applicants .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would they no longer fill them out , the citizens would have to take advice up to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the same near the city , and it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are focused on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch park .
the theat@@ rical bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stage rehabilitation is still subject .
in the latter alone , the latter will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the job here is fun . &quot;
st@@ aging is present for a city car@@ et@@ aker great game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gardening could be re@@ flexi@@ bly re@@ acted quite flexible .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the greens will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what rein@@ for@@ fits , &quot; when re@@ constructions are approved , emphas@@ ises the leaving city master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries out high responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs above my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working as Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified himself with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
if you want to buy Roland W@@ acker who would have completed a degree in studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with the execution of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and building planning .
municipal office building stands high and civil engineering , construction planning , grass property management , urban property management , urban enterprise of building with building yard and municipal engineering , including monument protection authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on pipes thrown : southern route closed
according to the police , previously unknown , the blue bike was thrown from the railway track to the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the pipes .
these were so strongly damaged , that the her@@ me@@ tic goods had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go from two male activity and are searching for them for the night hours .
near the crime scene there were a ros@@ y roll and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves into great danger , and also endangered the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the facility , as well as the late @-@ term , and the cost of rail goods could also be taken to the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ track could be led without disabilities .
almost ten people had fallen Friday afternoon , two of them entered the correspondence .
goods didn &apos;t turn out , however , they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and choc@@ ol@@ ates could help , IB@@ D ( oral formulation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms of patients with anti @-@ inflammatory diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the affected will usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to re@@ lie@@ ve its symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intestinal pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in eating , do not enter into the body .
cells that are inher@@ ent to em@@ ulate inflammation of cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage to the body without sensitive tissues .
if the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may cause an inflammatory formulation .
in experiments , there was found that a type of tolerance extraction immune cell in mice found that bear a particular bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition will toler@@ ate an anti @-@ inflammatory intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus if the same system is in human verteb@@ ra@@ ke .
the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan looked for a kind of immune cells , which promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but had not accommod@@ ated this .
they presum@@ ed that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the D@@ är@@ me of mice have been DNA sequ@@ en@@ ated and there were six bacterial species found in the mice that were absent with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were tu@@ cked in a sterile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they were not developed by immune cells , and they obtained the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria explo@@ res the immune system , the researchers ex@@ terminated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and subsequently led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells , isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells was about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory formulation .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts on Tuesday before the UEFA Super Cup began on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of blues and abol@@ ished only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to have three further novel@@ ties , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four pre @-@ purpose re@@ jec@@ tives .
&quot; three of four to receive , thanks to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given themselves great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilot flew from Seattle in U.S. state to Washington but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the wheel shield , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new descent for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns around , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the prime minister of the prime minister went to Berlin with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stor@@ ks from the party headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant , was the most important desire of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz takes the party , the fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind in the base .
there were deep strikes .
and one after the other .
the test@@ ament @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green Party member led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
five months before the election code , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
Michael Kell@@ ner , the Green Party leader , Michael Kell@@ ner has called to return to El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets , to return to their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear failure of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets immediately has to return to their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens on the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ s a SPD election soldier , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ rel@@ ates will reach the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green members El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without his own government .
it is the preliminary culmin@@ ation of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , calm down the com@@ rades s@@ nat@@ al .
after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was also true - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite broke the party smoothly .
the com@@ rades have returned to the weeks after the com@@ rades in the weeks later .
then , when she had turned out new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low precip@@ itation came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he did not make anything wrong in the crisis communication , something you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ emission and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister has already been in criticism since longer .
mix values came along .
nevertheless , or perhaps exactly , because in recent weeks , Weil always tried to put acc@@ ents in the federal government .
com@@ rades of the former civil master of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they sent him , because they spoke of because a stabil@@ ising of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
in this case , because of the parties , the lower @-@ Sax@@ on green vegetation is basically no fault .
and Schulz did not at all .
at times , the com@@ rades make efforts to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger focuses on the green , and above all on the sec@@ lu@@ sion@@ ate par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets her own career @-@ food about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the Part@@ mit@@ es in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets is not responsible for her person as a direct candidate , but above the country @-@ list of the Sax@@ on green to parliament , so the lower @-@ Sax@@ on par@@ liament@@ arians continued .
the logical consequence is that it returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate was clear four years ago : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Austr@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as leader candidate , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he fal@@ si@@ fies the personal career of a future CD@@ U members of the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know whether there has been more or more ongoing support of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding of the Centre III
who wants to renov@@ ate his home in the years , will be able to get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler announced once again a review of the previous event .
since 1991 , it has been in sensi@@ tis@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the Field Division II from 2005 to 2016 , the result was still at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the current re@@ aliz@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the internal development , and not just exclu@@ de new construction areas .
on April 4 , I have received information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III .
the total amount of € 8@@ 33 333 is 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the commune sens@@ ing .
how does a renovation area therefore arise ?
one will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area , interest in interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the regional borders could also shift once again .
the St@@ eg represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states that would then be carried out in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving the residential and occupational conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , which means per plot , carried out .
the san@@ itation was then established as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the funding will be running until April 1st , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock intake would be carried out only until September this year , as part of those involved in the san@@ itation area involved a questionnaire .
in November or December , the set @-@ up will be made possible to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commun@@ e had to conduct the fores@@ aw investigations .
it is the reason to assess the urban abuse and decide when it is renovated and in which scope .
it will also be entered in the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again and become a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized a major success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled to the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things around the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential ar@@ c &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may be done to size , division , and inhabitants of a housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ar@@ c &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill if the commercial premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application of funding .
new building measures will not be eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler empha@@ sized that the distribution of the convey@@ ors according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog &quot; principle - who comes first , comes first .
you could not be able to reserve a promotion of funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were also photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself sets out a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he will open its doors to enter his office , and can even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now provides the service for companies and individuals that want their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the im@@ plant method is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .

the promotional costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were up to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President on board was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of all over 50 states .
in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire b@@ lows from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck , was issued in Connecticut .
the White House of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before Hel@@ icop@@ ter &apos;s Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy military commission for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 : 00 a.m. on the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second crew would require a second crew .
the original flight att@@ ach@@ ments were during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel remained at the plane during the time .
the records provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear , if ultimately , a second flight att@@ ach@@ ute was needed .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits federal government to use state property of political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President issued an attack for the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump led an investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of messages that evaluate over the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all over 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy chief of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by to put the US President at the White House with precise Zen@@ timet@@ res .
at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercise courses in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support com@@ missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in having helicop@@ ters to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ate of the U.S. Department of Defence for the 2017 fiscal year , the DO@@ D revenues for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight session .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of sales growth is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , revenue rates for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press pre@@ fers of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things which are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to empha@@ size that . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter when he saw his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire b@@ lows .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump also spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and taught with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top leader of the second tennis Bundesliga kicks off at the tab@@ ular Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss takes place tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the tab@@ ular Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leader in the second tennis Bundesliga has received the meaning for reality .
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect to the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability in the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , And@@ re Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ adic@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will always be hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good serving luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is very convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment , at the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament , the French Bi@@ ella is not active in the Bundesliga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar &apos;s tournament will be used at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first deployment in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ c An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at ATP tournament in Kit@@ z@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
in Kiel , he should be as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ au@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could join the team again .
enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , does not fill any of the train@@ ers around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America the O@@ MV can harm
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump wasn &apos;t happy when he sat down his signature on Wednesday evening against the sanctions of sanctions against Russia .
in his absence , the law en@@ acted , &quot; the congress gave a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels is ashamed of the U.S. pre@@ violation .
after all , the design sees to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians increase gas pi@@ pelines to the EU .
since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , are co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Stream 2 .
the drug is massive .
however , it was too early for an estimate of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions still by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has considered that the Group could destroy and who could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the town is located in the field of 46 children &apos;s venues , in 44 the children have lunch time a warm meal .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children were seated at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are taken care of at noon in the Kit@@ a , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ time workers from September 1 , kitchen staff : they warm the delivered food , add to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , rinse , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned firmly to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ een @-@ group@@ ed establishments - decides about the hour circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz happy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the Kit@@ al@@ paper simpler , educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is also : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection to the team &apos;s team is there meaningful .
and for the children too .
&quot; they have a known power in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing human beings . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the Kit@@ a rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out in price comparison between own reg@@ ie and foreign exchange for the city as the most economic growth , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people at the educational area not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the leader of the United Nations Mission &apos;s mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ di@@ zing in the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ ces for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and believ@@ able if women are un@@ restricted and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial government and the presidential election will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat missions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections will be held peac@@ efully by a democra@@ tically elected government for the first time .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will increase the democratic success Afghanistan .
Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns over investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to be at the managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over long @-@ term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company lost about the future of investments in the Toll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is produced by other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Plac@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would learn &quot; as the first &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ alle@@ e , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s plans to express &quot; concerns that the financing of the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pro@@ cured . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and wealth , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing life costs and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a thri@@ ving production of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Fili@@ alle@@ e at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , since we estimate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , our shops constantly examine and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ cross as production facility full and completely . should change our operations at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago ahead of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the La League &apos;s page likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after exp@@ elling a range of £ 189 million in order to exp@@ el its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but they have been warned about three years before the world record case ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out without the Catal@@ ans , although the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival of Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will contact them in opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish club earlier this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly showed that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their pricing for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ ar@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ ar@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him , so that he had to depart to the right .

interview : &quot; domain spar@@ row report dischar@@ ges Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s brother @-@ brother @-@ brother @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger came from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means writer and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the disp@@ atch sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ner , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated by the German press agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would be very important to see the appearance of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own under@@ ings or their in@@ correct assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that with the coverage of violence against the Dom@@ inion atzen station with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would have to prevent &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that it is meant to be normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to go on the church , and it &apos;s a fallen fres@@ cos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saw a normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with friends , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards to turn to former decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who ended with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber has presented ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 shelves were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ ti@@ bility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; so summar@@ izing , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. had been applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for students could also fall heavy .
in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of the general humanity by R. inv@@ ali@@ ens and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even received positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the disp@@ atch sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spin atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion has been reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , many students raise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the other , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was tan@@ gible , if a domain did not bring a top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you be as his bi@@ ographer this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one turns on the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , one needs to ask himself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all in it .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or compassion on terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre@@ school also occurred outside of its impact sphere .
it can be taken to him if it is too late , or did not have the first incen@@ tive to have taken seriously .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was experienced by virtually all the respondents than - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent report , describes him as &quot; warm hear@@ ty , &quot; &quot; expert , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; , &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as extremely beneficial teachers who supplied the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ chen .
that he did not only threw with chairs and threw the key bund on the ground , but also ear @-@ hear@@ ted guys gave to the hair and ears , he has already admitted to years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
in his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods in the fra@@ id time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents like in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state school , experienced .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the deliber@@ ate sexual mis@@ use and non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , they are free bag@@ at@@ ellen .
so , one wonders whether it &apos;s not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just stor@@ med him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him , still eager for him .
but the truth is : the report was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also be put on a burden on sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never given me to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a troubled representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they are not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not for a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ row @-@ Student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he would have had his sentence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been the off@@ ender .
I hold it ... even for a really absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to him ... be@@ et@@ ate ob@@ tru@@ sive or clear@@ er , or rather , as compared to their parents , Internet conduc@@ tors , confidenti@@ ality teachers etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the advance of affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the scope of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore exemp@@ li@@ fied by any fellow worker .
thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented it or have brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflic@@ ted crimes in connection as unfortunately in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of taking part in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and men@@ tions about a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what a mis@@ use of the report .
there is clean up separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ spar@@ row , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we once say , other pre@@ ferences .
moreover , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had not been ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ spar@@ row .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boy of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were par@@ ked and mal@@ icious , they all have occurred on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have prev@@ ails .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on his face when she had already been at the Dom@@ aine eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ an &quot; states .
what was different at Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ st violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity by R. and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even received positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish itself and from its predec@@ essors , where he was not working and responsible for him , ( such a witness ) did nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ aine @-@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre@@ school the test will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the risk of negative press , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned in Bavaria .
before that , it took place in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows .
it was hard to estimate for him where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the permissible border was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away .
that is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards for the then time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the past today &apos;s moral standards .
the princ@@ ess has already been right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , who , at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s boards , that goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds for discipl@@ in@@ ation and punishment , so earrings &apos;s ears and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment , he has also been strictly forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which image from his rainy days , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given you again in our conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject to this subject also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so pop@@ e Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells his perspective , there the domain spar@@ rows played only one side role .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t waste , that he led a strictly regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ scripts , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , right in which area but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what a man do you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in their book talks ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply belie@@ ver and hear@@ ty people , of whom one could not imagine that he could do something to just a fly .
I get regularly with how many former domain spar@@ rows are still today , 23 years after his embar@@ ation , regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly agreed to them , so clearly in the minority .
most of the domain spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him that he has brought her life and brought them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , vag@@ u@@ ter@@ istic teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect , to which they still look today and to honor her .
and please , once more clearly : all that one throws it , are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ ister .
there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious .
for the report that has just been released , reli@@ eves him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had gotten himself great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and maybe no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ aine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
