<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-pin, where young people are to meet up today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb of greeting, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener farms the rusty reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying, if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that had to be exciting, because the car-Navi was instead of an Umbreach road to a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportals in Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compares them with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Mercury's spread-area since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickepad, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great oversight card, for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps were built, so-called judgments.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, during the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey Bayerns on behalf of course - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville, from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who create the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">KurfürstMax IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urgenblatt for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all other on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / today is the most impressive example of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subroutine that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the city is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Austria concentrate around 1856 along the today's plingress, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance: in the execution, a small-part map with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten flurers from the so-called "Urbino," which has been derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels do not occupy farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of the underline.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the October of October, was actually a lawn - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the allegations, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" district of the Au-Haidhausen's District name, "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with insets.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich county-Irrenne was created "On the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the name of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "in addition, he has prohibited the staff to turn violence against the occupants," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place have been space, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity also ranged from - the reason for the construction of the Kreiseresis in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of former Auer pin, young people encounter the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order gained the building complex in 1920, and turned it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 they built the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - based on the origin of the origin of the Irvine, who had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as "main square," the purchase road was called "Kaufinger lane."</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies's bombs broke down many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof where these days work on April 5, 2017, the breaking-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting gallery, the old Munich map will be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof hole.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights published in travel agent for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has exhibited a warning for colored people who travel due to discriminating politics and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri, which will bring special attention to the state by the State of Missouri by August 28, 2017, as a number of fragile, road-based accidents occur in the recent state and noted here," "" "said it in the position of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, which aim to take effect on minorities, prompted the group to publish the itinerary, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries to the civil rights, people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped due to their skin color, they will be beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the trip through the state by the State of Missouri, without being accused of crimes.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points on a recently published report by the Office of the Office-General of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be more frequent in the state 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff have informed about what could happen in Missouri," "" "says Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring it money or to their relatives that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 of them in hate, according to the latest figures from the FBI's anti-crime program, which steps the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) travel budgetations for Texas and Arizona have adopted the local prosecutions authorities to commit people because of immigration obedience, which will contribute to the ACLU for further expansion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel covers are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have deployed the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecaunus project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishbacher Weidecaun project is a success project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac secured a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">For the right-graveyard of the family of Schwendemann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave first insight into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows, so swivel." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriduste there is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since it is also the BLHV chairman of Fishbach, he described the crossover project as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't make any recovery on the type of surface.</seg>
<seg id="76">Green landscaping care for a lot of work, much should be processed with the sense sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been working here with the conditions and the topography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteristic operation and used this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the crossover project and is glad about the leaders promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the restoring of the areas could still be moved even for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "he stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand due to promoting often in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forenforced until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros was funded by half of the leader, a quarter carried out by the community of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, farmers have to invest 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezvn.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and land women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß was also fixed:" "" "here best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-area policy (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of women's fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to restore the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Requirement is the presence of one by the lpr conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area should not be insufficient (hangover 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running, which would like to build up just about 16 kilometers of fence in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans do appreciate this as well as any other - hence the credentist of Saddam Husseins portrayed at the Firdos Square in Baghdad 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a hot war with Jim Acosta by CNN about the suggestions of presidents to dramatic limiting the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-Imiters would have had an ynchronous if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their importance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base has been added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained:" "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom which enlightened the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemporary words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor:" "" "your poor, your poor, and the thronged masses that are looking for free to breathe freely; the eleventh waste of your rich coastlines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Trumps United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who decided to place their words after their death in the base - knew very well that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans, showing the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the composition with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to switch from the right wing back for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn't invite anyone but rather an early neoconservative that the American flame follows the surrounding world: "lady Liberty goes on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Reasonably unusual is Limbaugh here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is whole, and a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they see from the exhaustible, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope, and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, Miller and trump ever wanted to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torches shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power, inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Teams</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schott belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "black believe that" "" "it's something special in Scotland," "" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from this." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue to continue until we find out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics Men: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle from the team became a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie was very natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">"" "the Commonwealth of silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships for the 400 m hurdle, says that it is" "" "unbelievably" "" "that 16 Schott are in the British team." ""</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midrange of Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another sotte, which is one of the great season that saw the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games, was watching.</seg>
<seg id="149">He remembers her first World Championships as the only other Schotte in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "" "" "the European capitalists says that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "to the fact that many of their compatriots do not belong to the team but in some cases, also with medals and fines." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "it is so special to remember that they were elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and voted to make me something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Schott who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athlets, athletes who want to climb on poker.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's simply going to be a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: do not take a public office if you don't have to tolerate the voters of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers beat him because of all, from the home policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He impregnated with criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics on silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and dumb, we become like sheep for the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted it on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained that this week was the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governement dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and playing his hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come on the side of the governors - which is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governement and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of cast or spammers or hamming people who winches the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the actual people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest asked the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hassfilled but she asked to hate hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I insisted that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentator of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't like this idea, if a number of people on the same subject, they will be regarded by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a great group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governement as "concentrated Spam-Attack," would call others "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductors to collect and burn protesters, or bring protesters to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticises that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complains by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County promised the First Around ment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they proclaimed a electorate of their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washington had a similar effect on the Internet at the time of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters pens on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticised his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="472">According to the Word document, according to the Tumlinger mountain apart from the first parish church, there was also a glorious yard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the HilariusChurch is broken.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple had been made.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm attacked the storm and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted.</seg>

<seg id="1364">A judicial states that this means that Colin owned the value of $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico tells that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief of Staff of the White House, met in his first working day with senior employees, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: poor information that will be given into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Cellar's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitor his meditation.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps Relationship went back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate of Trump was offended due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince him," said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February to poltico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicians Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" "" "the key to keep the trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officers, ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighter officials know something we don't know other - that trumps tweets still contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it too many times, anger from him, then their efforts have been paid.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has failed to prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by presenting their own agenda by promoting its own views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported on the preference of consultants, pretensioning strategic reasons of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press lines, especially those with damaging lungs, and that he may find out to find out what these originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone accused the first copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson was banned from Twitter because he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to ask people over Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus but trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair by US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past weeks, the panel recorded work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on appeal with the cause of confidential persons.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded his investigation and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps, oldest son and Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin since long, targeted targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are aimed at the election campaign as an advisor to the republicans.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special mediator Trump personally hit the center and seek the accusation, whether the President in the course of the affair may hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on if it is a larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the station CNN, pre-charges have already been issued, which turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.</seg>

<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also, Trumps advisor and Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner and his damaging election winner Paul Manafort were with the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the creation show that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide about data collection.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the creation of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the examinations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president of Thursday took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia's affair as a campaign in his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this root accusations were turned out against Trump, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump has asked him a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands for the investigation, under large pressure.</seg>

<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelravels is in danger, because the front edge had never been withdrawn, as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice slab stand under tension and can be broken, if there is a piece of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim in water and ice as much water as it gives to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shelight also leads to the glacier directly into the sea, which can flow and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI-C, the Larsen-C-Schelleis is the fourth largest slaughtering of the Antarctic.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher does not return the demolition of this gigantic iceberg in the climate change, so in the past few decades, the Antarctic Peninsula are broken.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence, threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Lavender is recalled due to drought conditions and related insects, which avoids scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, the expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change during the past few years, and much more rain in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium, the Zwergzikaden skipped, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And it's a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil does not only fish for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered, belong to a better water distribution and slowing of the evaporation of the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dry.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The weekly paper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting over the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug dingggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the walking list of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest from violence, and during all the country the bodies are frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto on December 2012. 589 are standing according to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editors and their inspirator from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the thirties, bear T-shirts, that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though, in 2010, a special Office of the Attorney General was built to form the cases of journalists, according to the report to the Protection of Journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug dealers and organised crime, the journalists are rarely put on trial by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intraterally east and although the terrain is still traced.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why we miss all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the theme of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't make anything that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of embellished, two-story Mausoleen for drug, who are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the sons, presumed Ganghioners bought each copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the capture of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the same story to leave the country in its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long, that his friends and colleagues draw that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 USD participations.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without using the poison problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard treading examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else had to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committees for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where she has gone.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to fear that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of many things? why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who could curse like a harbour workers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice was a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayanabo, the bar opposite the office, and sitting there on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions in question as they do their work on the best and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it, if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-sufficiency and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be duped... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules as he and others say, in Sinaloa no longer apply - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggelroutes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where people met by Riodoce for security training came suddenly no cell phones allowed. days earlier became known that Spyware, who is sold exclusively on governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a large-class residential neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor himself as untrusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug attacks de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce arrived on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the public spending which was concentrated on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office's office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was enjoined when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporters learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost ruled the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-carving cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, among them one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier the readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "before we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "because of its slender body statur." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, to protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected - activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration on the office of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists became aware of the whole country by using them in organized protests "SOS Press" in terms of obedience and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez's case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuse the authorities to expose journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then, she has asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that their rage has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, involved government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug names, but also on orders of politicians and security forces organised with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the "Articulo 19" media group has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you'll die because they want you hold the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the Morde have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the Bloginist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas before six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">One computer keyboard and earphones are next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches were elected, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez set publicly on the drug cartel with a Editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted as the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz was murdered.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, gives the drug traders frightened him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement before the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sums.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with band rival and security forces near the swimming pool Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as it was promised by a series of Kartell Embassies in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they would have had something from an "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the buried dinosaurs which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-esteemed condition has researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored hereaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio when he took place at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of the surrounding rock, and decided to see more precise.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy petroleum.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you have blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," "" "said the Main Event Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will go in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant frescoater, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a bottling tank, probably threatened by the carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly woven dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before predators, and used a parachuting, which is also used as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to leave his enemies, say experts, which suggests that there was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creation from the family of the Nodosaurier has first made headlines in May and now is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and it Borealopelta markmitchelli named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen was enabled to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the constitution, a widespread defence method in animal rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the Contershading is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the living animals survives.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure through flesh eaters of Dinosaurs, that the evolution of confrontation caused the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the congregations - think about Rehe, Zebras or belts - are much smaller and hurt as prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator-behavior on a massive, strongly geaded dinosaurs indicate how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotated.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on critics above his life, including his fourth intestine to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died in a river, and sank into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because he is covered completely with conserene skin, but is also available in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal." "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost as looks like in the early chalk time.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when giant Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, had passed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted from some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been liquidated after death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the retained-preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle up to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips, which raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant frescoater was wasted through the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater yield of the dinosaurs kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so well received that the skin is still bumpy tank plates along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I answoe, the confusing it will.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - what's going to do already in most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased over the app by rail, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And lastly you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works as follows: one rises in the train, calleth his ticket among "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers then a button to the electronic discharge appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train heads will receive a message that driving gast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the tractor comes at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already used online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep further, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for rail - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who are often train, knows that in addition to delay and twists, the ticket controls are among the greatest medical products.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of the fellow travelers don't know all the documents you need for use on online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either missing the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that you have to point.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train heads and driving pleasure, which leads to a worse mood in the evenings or delays and delays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaffner at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections of ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same circuit are not unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by somebody from High School.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else had posted information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ theePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>

<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "thought Ferrell" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"" "there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be his father who had a sign with the inscription:" "" "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed, with which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured another police officer and cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip, and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she repeated their 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and loss of resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which she had many times in front of this morning, "above the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this, what they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I was lucky enough to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no eclatant racism, it is not different to the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them away from far. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority to a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officers Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism has changed after 9 August," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted only to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "will you document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often of White - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought to the project closer together, along with six other locals did the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be depicted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in motion "not around a Messiah guide, but for a community that comes together," said Folayan - she turned out to be the most obvious participant of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of fertile life as she loves and married her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and humankind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is repeating the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the year 2012, identify the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling with various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to observe that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a affirmatic type of action," where Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras have long disappeared in Ferguson, but the racic connections between the church and the police continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she cloned to a singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she walked three years ago in Ferguson onto the street.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is still not built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has folded the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic hardly can be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while the one-bit Gallery says:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "it would be real class" "" "(Nicole Six), comes from the other side:" "" "no man" "" "or quite simply:" "" "megalahn!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery gives more customers to the city, of which the rest of the shops benefit, fear the enemy, that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be planned on the property, on which the farm market stands, which will offer 13 direct marketing products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction, it will end up.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda Square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying almost a week in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">The butcher was also discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if you are direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project is likely to be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shoppers are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since it is not even a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the market hall remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because at least the goods offered there is fresh, is offered largely directly from the producer and is purely inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, Ladin shops can be rented in a shopping center just from larger companies, because the dorfences are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farm market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it make a bit-bit gallery to drive out all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs no one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market there's a lot more - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasantry is broken, another piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unpleasant - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks tubes and haircut, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysis took a 35-year sentence after she publicly made diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, created by Manning, and if someone with these genomic data could look like somebody with these genomic data, the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward II, but has been openly condemned to identify the identification as a woman in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison it was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is deliberately sitting on a driver's seat and she wears a platinum blonde barg - with whom she has been associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigars and chewing gum by extracts the DNA from the waste to produce an image how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," "" "Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were added to unequal Brieffreels, which took over several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic" "" "Supported Images" "" "to convert a future in which the President Chelate's verdict would be to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison was a welcome kind of happy promises.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also some civil war and Starkes, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths which he should actually fix, continue to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen in a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery written, Manning called for Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) at the end of the "automatic splashing, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), like astounding similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition located in an own room is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges with a release of hands in the hands of the disciplines of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was expected in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of masks, of its own genomic Simulakras, which were like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your staff think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap Polls and Polls of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows a look at a glance, which units have most complaints and which executives can have low-performance results - so that you can pursue, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to look at the top of the workplace culture, so that you do not have the next Uber, who has been involved in Skandals, who has been published a blog post since then a former employee describes a blog post, with those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for an overview of a lucrative business option.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion value according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year at the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convert has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber registered recently as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent Enterprise lets you send custom "pulse" surveys, confidential answers in real-time and view the warmth-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can log in bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leaders are involved, complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees are badly treated or inethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, workers-fluence and lamentation.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has convert Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find out a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to pursue the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company convert Convercent may have problems that were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or less internship faster and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group by Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we are protecting our shareholders' employment disputes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen, because of ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right," that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty washing online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology for monitoring of ethics, people used hope than a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convert provide your software as a service, and strain the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, both supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convert $10 million for financing in February of companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing up the whole capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Exhibitors secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that will feel their voices, and that work that you are doing, they feel stronger and committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renders when its portfolio company run smoothly. companies run fine if employees are employed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics Tools make third-party promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment after experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company has no measures taken.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly, or not at all, this can motivate disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you will have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting on Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have abandoned itself to the collection of data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the people," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you do not care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly co-surveys now, was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback of frustrated employees she was able to re-organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights on the employees, and it hopes that on long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch which is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you will lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a siphole for Margaret Thatcher in 1970-1980 and 1980-1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Conscil River Valley in Kent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it is so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he tells of one accord." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he thought unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter so reacts that he was written by a double agents in the 1700's years, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, for then a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as he would also be there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England, and almost four months lived in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") it seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian chant, to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monologemonary buttons on the walls and bottles that have spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landlords, gardeners and sometimes with the artists, working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only full access in 2006 when the final adult, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he said as "hundreds of years, where Aristocrats said," Oh, put it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps that would like: "one could mean that country-conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch in order to fight two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go ahead! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to include the wider base in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man that built the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot who joined the castle in 1380, titled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ', says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "the farmer's uprising began in this field and I thought, an uprising was a good start." ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe they are connected to each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit paters which hid the family Darrell seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', portrayed by the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, filled his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later than his sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be rather difficult to make debt and spending money for things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men deletes their debt crisis by giving rich old women. I imagine it as a heap of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his approach in the castle, Rhodes in search of other unique write-experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elseänki, the grounds of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been receded by nature again.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 state operator, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Thereby it seemed, as Erdogan is tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals are considered to be the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they were calling on their role as guardians of the worldly statute.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan objected the power of the military step by step, not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, the shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are funny about them, but the companies deliver every quantity of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone, who feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are attained by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs" "" "and then select everything from the robot color of the robot via the shape of the chest to type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, as many robots have the "Personalities" who would like to make a stepford-woman to be progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing as for example, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" who conveyed the impression of schooling and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So, they like what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this scension of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subjectory female properties that goes on rape, if you encounter a step on Frigid (means here: contradiction) Farrah is going to worry about most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and its increasing refinement indicate a little darker and tieferes in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men of course do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noticed their rising popularity, they still remain in the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakage from the boundary zones, in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, be very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives them the permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a time, in which the rights of women are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House, who praises women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most striking aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of handmaid ') are not the graphic pictures, the unworn body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point when it comes to their "Personalities," the robot will not represent real women.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become one Binsenweishness of the trump era, that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. voters, also split families in small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to cope with the horror of the dump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to look forward to our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The power Trumps, families, has been less noticed.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity may have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With the ump in the White House, everyone knows whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by ump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his mkittens will not get rid of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a frightening-term long-term scenario, in the trump republicans of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's comic version of the decline - the dog on the Autodach - the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be physically healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carussells of New York's parking department, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city, if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music is a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of London - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-1920s can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have chosen the Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one was asked.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same thing plus the option to balance your rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the table.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but does pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no required is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was innocent, while I was tired of experience to rich my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to murder for murder, because of murder after an appeal.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolates could help, IBD (oral formulation)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causes stomach cramps and paralysis, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected will usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve its symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestinal patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in eating, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are inherent to emulate inflammation of cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage to the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may cause an inflammatory formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, there was found that a type of tolerance extraction immune cell in mice found that bear a particular bacterium in its innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition will tolerate an anti-inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system is in human vertebrake.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan looked for a kind of immune cells, which promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but had not accommodated this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of mice have been DNA sequenated and there were six bacterial species found in the mice that were absent with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were tucked in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they were not developed by immune cells, and they obtained the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria explores the immune system, the researchers exterminated L. reuteri in a liquid and subsequently led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells, isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol 3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells was about 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to deaf, the Düsseldorf-Pleite broke the party smoothly.</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because he did not make anything wrong in the crisis communication, something you can do wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the Field Division II from 2005 to 2016, the result was still at least 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the current realizations are a "successful project" - it was finally important to promote the internal development, and not just exclude new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I have received information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total amount of €833 333 is 500 000 Euros from the country, the rest of the commune sensing.</seg>

<seg id="2889">Georg Ratzinger's brother-brother-brother-brother Georg Ratzinger came from the "" "" Regensburger Domp "" "" report. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means writer and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the dispatch scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisner, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated by the German press agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very important to see the appearance of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret about their own underings or their incorrect assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that with the coverage of violence against the Dominion atzen station with" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the grips in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would have to prevent "shameful and shameful deeds," but the "degree of media manipulation," thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethic Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that it is meant to be normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "" "it's going to go on the church, and it's a fallen frescos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, they pointed out that in their youth" "" "saw a normal educational means" "", "to be done with friends, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, today's standards to turn to former decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who ended with Ratzinger the" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber has presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 shelves were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plautibility" "" "victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "so summarizing, that by Domkapellmeister R. had been applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially high Emotionality, the punishment for students could also fall heavy.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims of the general humanity by R. invaliens and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even received positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the dispatch scandal at the Regensburger Domspin atzen station Georg Ratzinger of his opinion has been relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence" at the Regensburger Domsparrows "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for example, many students raise his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">To the other, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which was tangible, if a domain did not bring a top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you be as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one turns on the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one needs to ask himself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or compassion on terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its impact sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can be taken to him if it is too late, or did not have the first incentive to have taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was experienced by virtually all the respondents than - so literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent report, describes him as "warm hearty," "expert," and "understandable", "competent" and "understandable," as extremely beneficial teachers who supplied the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about its perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which also led to Wutauschen.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw with chairs and threw the key bund on the ground, but also ear-hearted guys gave to the hair and ears, he has already admitted to years ago, deeply regrets and apologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">In his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods in the fraid time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents like in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a worldly school, a state school, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the deliberate sexual misuse and non-violence at the preschool, they are free bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">So, one wonders whether it's not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just stormed him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him, still eager for him.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report was Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domsparrow.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also be put on a burden on sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never given me to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a troubled representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they are not even parents and siblings, then not for a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrow-Student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he would have had his sentence (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been the offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... even for a really absurd to assume that it is reckoned to him... beetate obtrusive or clearer, or rather, as compared to their parents, Internet conductors, confidentiality teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the advance of affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the scope of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exemplified by any fellow worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented it or have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicted crimes in connection as unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "non-violence" at the Regensburger Domsparrow.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of taking part in the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mentions about a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clean up separately: between the preschool and high school of the Domsparrow, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we once say, other preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger had not been choral director of the Domsparrow.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boy of sadistic teachers were parked and malicious, they all have occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to have prevails.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on his face when she had already been at the Domaine engymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, like most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradigan" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims are estimating the general humanity by R. and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even received positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish itself and from its predecessors, where he was not working and responsible for him, (such a witness) did nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domaine-engymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the preschool the test will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the risk of negative press, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to use today's educational standards for the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate the past today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, who, at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's boards, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds for disciplination and punishment, so earrings's ears and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment, he has also been strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which image from his rainy days, Georg Ratzinger has given you again in our conversations with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject to this subject also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so pope Pope Benedict XVI, tells his perspective, there the domain sparrows played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't waste, that he led a strictly regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without these perfectionism, without which demand unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world transcripts, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, right in which area but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger in their book talks?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believer and hearty people, of whom one could not imagine that he could do something to just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domain sparrows are still today, 23 years after his embaration, regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly agreed to them, so clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain sparrows are thankful to him that he has brought her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vaguteristic teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect, to which they still look today and to honor her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one throws it, are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinister.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now there would be a 93-year-old man who had gotten himself great merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and maybe no one would probably know the Regensburger Domaine" "", "finally in peace." "" "" ""</seg>
