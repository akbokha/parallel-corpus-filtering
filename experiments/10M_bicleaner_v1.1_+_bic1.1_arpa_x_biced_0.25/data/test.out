a spokes@@ man of the Sons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that she was shocked by his death , &quot; to be destroyed in the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will never miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he never wanted to participate in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .

Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in dra@@ wers .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
&quot; I am always plug@@ ged in dra@@ wers or get glu@@ ed out from the outside label which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather car@@ ving . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at what they are as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they declared in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the actress is best to spend her time at home , pre @-@ tel@@ ev@@ isions with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white , they bring the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston as a sole mother of two sons .
the film will run with us on August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are unmistak@@ able .
at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was seeking a little bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport py@@ rami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses remembered her holiday , they hunt for the quick gal@@ lop home to the feed comfort .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer in all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left his family with his family over the facility of AL@@ RV , he swore to his own horse on a horse .
it was the first time in Aachen and thus at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete won &apos;t lack any awards .
Federal Chancell@@ ery , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions tour player of the year ...
even the British queen has already changed him .
the 18th winner of the sport pyramid is long .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he got the prize money of 25.000 Euros as well .
with 15 more outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ fold US @-@ mast winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ck and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ cher , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the wr@@ ist Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential elections are , however , in case of tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , about the role of the state .
ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns that the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate the economy , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claims tr@@ ump .
he will go back massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for businesses .
Clinton said against it : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
that is why the taxes were increased for the rich , says she .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which they must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost password .
the democratic candidate is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , you could still have part@@ ying internal discussions .
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive up coal transport in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in the areas of protected areas , to termin@@ ate the Parisian climate agreement .
in contrast , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create the power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; there will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the USA don &apos;t want to ins@@ ulate from international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , Clinton is calling for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to be , then he says he could not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months should be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to leave the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him forward , so the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks curious in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the division &apos;s division of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and is involved with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are escaped .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who arrives here has made experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted , because they are accused of torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe , &quot; she tells .
in women there are other reasons for the run : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home , they have experience sexual violence , forced crimes , hon@@ esty , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that is driving them away .
that goes on to the run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for example , for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that when they come in Germany when they come in Germany , B@@ ahr .
even here , women in refugee shel@@ ters are often considered as an inferior and worst case .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the North of the Munich is trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not helping to help , there is more accommodations for them , call B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they have known from a similar project as in Munich in its responsibilities , some answer some with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are something in the governments of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ fers of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are only available women and their children in some common areas .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee on women and equality of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study that has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be too - constantly - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shower room should be accessible separately and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel of this protective need , one can read at the And@@ re who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
general practition@@ ers strike : demands for new working action
representatives of the assistant doctors have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour action in their disp@@ utes regarding a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employees at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said , that the ministers had failed to address the concerns about the agreement .
in July , Assi@@ sten@@ sts and media clients have agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court decided that the government had remained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ sist@@ ently quietly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC Board , the proposed new agreement to fully reject and demanded official new negotiations for all E@@ mot@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set up a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in that assistance of assistance in the year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , came to the election of the agreed agreement that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance denti@@ sts and medical inst@@ ants , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health said Jeremy H@@ unt that the contract for doctors had to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished one crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin will take his Turkish opponent in the g@@ ilded Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I can &apos;t convert the int@@ ru@@ cks that Ankara will most want to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the towel , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked as a mal@@ icious smile , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke out of his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report written five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better improvement .
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so it would never happen .
my enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to me .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable kis@@ ses showed that Russia &apos;s leaders had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back .
the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by an alleged boyfriend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be difficult to rebuild , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed , when the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
in the serious test the accus@@ ations were benef@@ ited from leading officers that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefits from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , who will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin &apos;s President Erdo@@ gan received the ap@@ ology that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is clear .
Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends that he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
the terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economical motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facil@@ it@@ ates when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television has predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West , since its reaction to the tried power out@@ pac@@ ed as a weak answer .
in addition , the sustained gro@@ ll comes across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to move from the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian leaders won a bonus for sure that he called for the attempted coup attempt by the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well noticed for Moscow , a self @-@ understand@@ ability that has changed even a profound fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one of how it once described me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of exterior sides , &quot; : two countries who stum@@ ble from the west and treated badly and is now banned .
nonetheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but support Russia and Turkey .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of the first call both President at the press conference said they could not even stri@@ ped the subject .
the President of Turkey were able to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found on Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey turns off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Staff , the R@@ BS fund should only be reduced to a back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the bank has been dist@@ anced since then , when she had almost collapsed and saved almost eight years ago .
in this time , brand str@@ at@@ egen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end users .
they supported the international Sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to push more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the IP@@ O change to Nat@@ west .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a view tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global objectives but local objectives .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations , and our employees will work under these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that his six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will not continue to continue , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the Bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ launch these brands , so I think that time has come .

I am very emotional because my family also here is
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I &apos;m busy here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ation when he takes the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstac@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a breaking career .
Lester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ys@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey der Moderne and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few ahead of him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he has been a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma loved fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie before a couple of weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already picked 6,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already made up almost 30 years of the winners , which is great .
he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the sign of the British flat screen for two decades .
it was ner@@ ven@@ erable .
a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ ous Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban .
three years ago , he had trouble when he returned from his six months of lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his branch and return to its top shape .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said before , that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s head of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin made un@@ expect@@ edly his head of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the most advanced confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin without indication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy director since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the manager and Chief Executive Officer .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of authority on legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the narrow@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
with a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff will return on his own request .
but despite the smile of the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power combat ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was praised as a potential president , wants to lead to the Russian environment policy - pushed to great sc@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on Putin , who are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated item - one could almost say - to trust the post for four years .
as it turns out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of Russian Security Council and how Putin was a member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted most .
once was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could lead to the second term of President of Russia because a third term of Putin would fall into the constitution .
but this post was taken from another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became President of three and a half years later .

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the Pis@@ ces that di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff .

Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing : a bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ an Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four cou@@ ches of the &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers &quot; that approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge segment of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 tra@@ des parts .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017 .
the business Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering firm from a truly epic scale with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total almost 79 % of the entire bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last part of the deck is located in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete bed for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
at this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is facing the pioneering high @-@ depth and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we needed to close the gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling in the northern slopes of 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
solid , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were wind@@ y - on each side it was only a few milli@@ meters .
luckily , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown by the fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swim in safety , while their boat moved away from own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found on a bo@@ oming without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the territorial boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have good luck and still be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency plug , but this dis@@ band@@ ed the boat of the Bo@@ ots by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has gains about these men today .

this al@@ ar@@ ming the sister of his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went with her life with her life .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life companion of the man .

who builds Braunschwei@@ ger &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken much stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next level of &quot; acting concept &quot; .
but war is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who should build the advant@@ ageous apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group President Christoph viol@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , must as@@ sign 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock .
the great fighting point in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build up with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing project program , which will cost millions and will still be financed , is intended to provide incen@@ tives .
the problem , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few provisions as possible .
the left still wants a hardness for investors .
regardless of its , as viol@@ inist , a deteri@@ oration of the situation on the residential market .
if the project concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet complete : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how is the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city now .
furthermore , it would have to be thought that apartments come back to the price .
this is possible in the West Bank .
in one blow , solve the problem .
because in the West city run the year @-@ end Fri@@ est .
around 1800 apartments can be found there in prices for affordable apartments .
only : we want the owners , housing companies not .
because the number of social apartments in the West city is again dras@@ tically increased , you remove from the goal of the so @-@ called flow mixture .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that it will still be moving in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ur@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be connected with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these have been focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child don &apos;t go outside without going outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to play on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go there is about to get people from the sofa and be more active .
at the first time , the screen was on TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I am sure of course , of course , on the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries became post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the player with their smart phones are looking outside and looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that were followed by a GPS once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase of steps taken from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35@@ ,000 users pursued , divided the Washington Post recently , with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to take &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; beat each day &quot; beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and people who look like .
nonetheless , the importance of sport can &apos;t be over@@ rated .
those who are regular sports , reduces his chances to get to cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to run them here .
but the wonderful at Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt for new friends .
as always , there are m@@ oods that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what does it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity before , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the New will lose its appeal and use the use of time .
however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in real world and will help many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bal@@ es is immune to all that is immune .
dynamic at the jump @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the floor .
full line brilliant .
and now Olympic champion is finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to be combined events and extended the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tournaments on the Swe@@ at@@ bal@@ es during the single majority of women during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who win a multi @-@ win title and overall the fifth , while they affir@@ ms its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success makes it the same league like a unique athl@@ ete , like Michael P@@ helps who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ it domin@@ ates her sport in the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between you and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not back with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , having won gold and silver in a single multi @-@ struggle for women during the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of the team Co@@ ordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
even though Bil@@ it insi@@ sted on the top of their long road to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym hall , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has never lost a combined competition in the summer of 2013 , a winner which will be as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led easily by two rot@@ ations , the picture led .
Swe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Emb@@ ell@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship titles - l@@ ousy .
she repeated again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ de bal@@ ks and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she was waiting for her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ cked on bil@@ it shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision described it once in her collection book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ alists , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a lead over the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their soil practice they cast the audience to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that is sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as much as it affects , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ eter has a very new meaning in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer in the car
according to the police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girls were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while listening to music while listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a ride , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ proof weapon while on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or that seems to be the att@@ ack@@ ers not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Jonathan S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to become a close look at whether they are linked with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods were killed in nine attacks seven people and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to establish the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which came to an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and out of that , it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create it not .
I do not create this .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund they can never see it under circumstances and that he may not even survive once .
some doctors even went so far , that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with aid to help .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year . he still cannot speak .
but he turns slowly progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him drawing language , &quot; he told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical language language -- she says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avirus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time after a pro@@ g@@ nosis , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it will get better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells that the 6 year old boy was shot up in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shot ab@@ uses , including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital at consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boys from the boys shared the transmitter , that he is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 year old men is in the critical state ; the other two victims are stable in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was placed on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical state , was shot , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined , whether among one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently came to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked to various assault ri@@ sts , over@@ se@@ wn the crime scene .
it seems that it was clear to be a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of walking distance , pul@@ ses were found .
here several armed fighters were given here , who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police skin p@@ mann Anthony G@@ inal@@ di police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently checks the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross sl@@ ayer at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she is re@@ covering and the police looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I consider under the Women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tur@@ nen , and that is out of more than one reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three Tur@@ ns , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls from other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ olic@@ ism is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has re@@ affir@@ med the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years the number one was a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympics , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics winner and the United States .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world master@@ in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold for women with an individual campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we &apos;re experiencing the top of this sport , but you don &apos;t see gy@@ ms around the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four tower girls in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns will unite the expensive sports and Turner first line in private gymn@@ asi@@ es , which are maintained by parents who are planning for training , alignment , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Turner receive its entire training and this is a dev@@ il@@ ant and long term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym training .
I founded my gym 20 years ago .
in my events we have trained free and affordable gymn@@ asi@@ es in Harlem for more than 15,000 people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality things that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art and benefit .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ acy for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to get to the gymn@@ astic and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you for so many young girls motivated with different background to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assi@@ sten@@ sts want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ting proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ment of a re@@ formed agreement with the function of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7.000 registered doctors who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July , H@@ unt plans were unveiled to establish the contract , and said that N@@ HS were found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and had any further delay for the employees and patients to be harmful .
the first assistance @-@ doctors should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend working to improve the maintenance of the times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ees for Assi@@ sten@@ sts , announced the last night in a message with : &quot; assistance of assistance , in particular that it will pre@@ heat the current staff crisis and will be able to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of doctors have to fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A solution on the solution of disp@@ utes to participate in the government on contra@@ diction and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ stun@@ ned silence .
this was what happened in a promise that Jeremy H@@ unt had made it last month , that his door would always stand .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt must act now , raise up the vibration and address the concerns of Assi@@ sten@@ sts . &quot;
if he does not do this , then the assistant doctors have made clear that they are ready to perform other workers .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ in@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and experts were involved to grant doctors on the strike @-@ chain deck .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better weekly re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance denti@@ sts that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistance of Assi@@ sts to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not achieve a little , they are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worried , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ sts and spoke to the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es on the concerns concerning the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hopes that the continued positive engagement will return to other important topics such as ren@@ unci@@ ation , flexibility for training , training courses and the gender @-@ specific wage inf@@ ancy in medicine - a sign of what was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medication which can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day medicine after the authorities recommended to date more people for a longer period .
the ger@@ inn@@ ed drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .

the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
every year about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty materials in the arter@@ ial walls .

culture of Political correc@@ t@@ ness , election fraud is bl@@ oss@@ oms in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from the office
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities will be ignored as a destruction of government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles strongly attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ en@@ during that evidence of electoral abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; ignored .
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now a ant@@ agon@@ izing of voters from religious motives , said that the police should be allowed to establish breaks out of poll@@ ing cabins to protect di@@ lu@@ te voters .
he recommends that voters should have a reference to them in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a elec@@ torate must only call his name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they release their electoral voice to prevent someone who cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions from un@@ official comm@@ itments or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government before the wider cor@@ rup@@ ture and financial fraud which goes down to protect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the official Mayor of Lut@@ ein was named after a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man had been per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical manner and that he had brought his critics with Rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations to silence .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the reli@@ ance of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or a follow @-@ up , with one person who cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent letter di@@ alling - with older members of the Muslim community pressure on people who choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the command of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as proof of evidence , pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , particularly women and young people to choose the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ean or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no matter that ... state institutions such a behavi@@ oral behavi@@ ors were ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , is also required to prevent tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options in order to ask voters off the choice after your identification .
not removable ink on the finger of a person once she has left her voice to prevent someone who cho@@ oses twice .
systematic inspec@@ tions about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are oblig@@ ated .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic press release .
ban that political activists have a full post @-@ election and env@@ elop@@ ing of correspondence .
the police auth@@ ori@@ ze the powers , to establish breaks down sel@@ ections .
a bill that was reli@@ eved by the Prosecutor of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
ban for@@ b@@ ade in electoral stations .
requirement that only English in the election stations must be used ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees take rule the rule that voters go alone into the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets , no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the election court l@@ ut@@ to Rah@@ man and his deputy for the war on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
it also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the election regi@@ strations of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles from Olympic port@@ folios in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are given this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and the band that has proven to be an impressive double @-@ course of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is not the only one who has won gold fighting athl@@ ete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you should give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which faces the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that are more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ p@@ ie@@ ties .
the fighter and the wolf : team member of the US team at ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet go on how a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team at ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers received the mad@@ ness in social media and gave to that he had already heard since his childhood , he looks like Leo .
&quot; I even see no great simil@@ arity , except the face hair@@ y , &quot; divided bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I don &apos;t know that as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take the focus of this year : the resulting simil@@ arity between the British Wide Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is to go through to the Cuban American voc@@ alist Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another tender comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal for Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ called skin and bl@@ on@@ des hair such as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others have fallen the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to that user , there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have a unbeliev@@ ably similar facial form and eyes .
other popular Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nes Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went away as &quot; Mi@@ ef &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off when he runs his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald who had been picked up in the comment team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to excited , as Mi@@ ef passed away , he died as a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Kan@@ adas Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the can@@ adi@@ ers to close the gap to China .
spectators in all Canada re@@ acted online when they were shocked by the tone and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Has the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter in China &quot; is like a pig dead &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not forget that they were still on the show &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Freestyle swimming pools for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald came on Twitter quickly and hard to put on him a lot of speech .
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ name wrote in Sarah Paradi@@ s : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you are not the presence of C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # disgu@@ sted .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortunate formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times at the end of the people who answers on Twitter via Twitter
the comment@@ ators Scott Rus@@ sel had to excuse themselves in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies for more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and published a message .
we regret it correctly , that these statements were made , and that it was enabled to be broadcast .
yesterday , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators on the show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear@@ er , Byron &apos;s comments are based on the performance of the swi@@ mmer in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ happy elected formulation . Byron doing what he has said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ don@@ ald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made in the C@@ BC Olympic program to excuse me , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have moved to the performance of the swi@@ mmer in and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no contemp@@ t was intended , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who tried in the heart of sham@@ el@@ essly under@@ wear
the buyer didn &apos;t know where they should see when a woman moved out their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ wear .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ te her as she looked in it , and put them back into the shelf .
they rock@@ ed further and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had gra@@ bbed the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again , and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ pants , with@@ drew her own str@@ uts and tro@@ users out and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find something discreet place to do it - it was just as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody star@@ red , when she returned the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before it finally decided that you did not liked it , went back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt her , or thinking about the person who would buy the under@@ pants , which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How do I think anyone would take care of under@@ pants , which had a different person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw clothes from the sale after it went - what &apos;s exactly good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her , and had not washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday August 9th at our branch in Folk@@ stone , consciously . &quot;
all products coming in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect himself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move up with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the spin on your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you turn back from behind , you should turn your turn away , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and get out of the line . &quot; he says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bows .
then beat him with the knee to the k@@ ste and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers hit pain together , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move forward , while taking the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers come from the front , the technology is similar - move your body out of the line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time leave the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ ster .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money - if you are not a Cra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the narrow@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eler under@@ gone the immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - taking place some of the repro@@ ach@@ er@@ est and most striking places in Europe .
the present@@ er and trav@@ elo@@ gue Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk failed his wake to a Euro @-@ piece , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a pur@@ ge button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to ensure the resistance of his immune system .
before the end of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer in order to show oneself and show us what he is going to get .
but the experiment , which was filmed by the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought , sc@@ atter the pur@@ ge of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveled through the world and ate alone and wonderful things .
public rail@@ ways to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets , the task was definitely the immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I have all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in his call .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ line showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric score of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer count generally amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to do after their L@@ umin@@ ometric count exceeds 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows bacteria numbers in different places such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have stayed in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll find nothing here , because it is inside disgu@@ sting here .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish products of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and simultaneously declares the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we did mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which thus ended that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have directed to him , like the be@@ ek@@ ed Russian toilet which will be shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to use it and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m happy that we recorded some of these dirty d@@ ain@@ ees on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents were involved in lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they may contain at least occasionally products that contained lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

the walls were rounded holes , wood floors were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and decor@@ ates gra@@ ffiti on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said they feared that the apartment is no longer repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to take into account , since this estate is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in time in the apartment and the police told that the terror that had joined the family , conf@@ isc@@ ate street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , drug abuse , drug dealers and excessive scre@@ aming , stre@@ et@@ ries and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
there were in the estate , which were tra@@ ded in the past drugs , torn the wood@@ boards .
neighbours said they watched them on the streets and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week violent of the estate , after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep today tomorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not always familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager by Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it had ab@@ h@@ ed the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and ancient toys were thrown onto the over@@ washed side of the house .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it sow@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as Del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step is to consider Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing .
that was a very difficult case because it was extremely difficult , and their deeds for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality , who have gone along with us and have done the information we have done .
I hope this development will don@@ ate some neighbours consol@@ ation and convey@@ s the message that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they all be over 20 .
a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house management now have to be dug away , surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ons and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given a fine penalty after the owner of a drug of a class B was found guilty .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one in her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life at a car accident in 2013 .
after being without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that she will del@@ ate ten@@ ants that don &apos;t hold on the house order .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police told that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t hold on the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who may think that they may behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were off@@ ended by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continues to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

this was the moment to start in the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a typ@@ ing jet over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military plane flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity across the sun@@ b@@ ans on the beach stage in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers appeared , as they in@@ comprehen@@ sible to make concerns about the noise of the üs@@ ums , without seeing what was coming through the clouds .
the incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers , who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a deep breath and there was a moment when it looked so out when it could crash . &quot;

tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were placed in panic , when the plane came from the darkness and was incredibly deep flew .
the Portuguese Air Force showed that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was located on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and so deeply flying , that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that jet due to the poor visibility due to itself is somewhat deeper than usual , however , the air force insi@@ sted that security was not at risk in any time .
fish fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese feast , in which four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force showed that the pilot due to the conditions - strong fog and bran@@ ded - had to fly as deeply - as a result of its visibility

even at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ gi@@ al stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince .
Sevilla in turn the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this application .

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans are pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional federal states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within their Republican camp from the race , the doubts still grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrong reports are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he again took his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can flood w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ons USA from June , Tr@@ ump and its competi@@ tor from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , at the same time .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance , which is common for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia also apply as endangered .
in an interview by the Senator CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wants to stop the advance of Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and they are behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich in the end , then Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump threat@@ ens to submit to the support of his election campaign , he should be able to present any better query values .
instead of whose aim to reach the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for the Congress , attract more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster sc@@ am in d@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee in this case .
Ken@@ ias athletes are threatened after the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
after a fraud testing in a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee informed promp@@ tly to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arian committee in order to investigate the case .
the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had already submitted a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er in the Olympic village .
this was the team deri@@ vation of Ken@@ ias have been reported by the d@@ oping control unit .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C information about the case to str@@ ingent its own research , provided an IA@@ AF present@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will take an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athl@@ ete , who stood on the list for training controls in the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to be informed of money @-@ payments in his country about upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he reportedly been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
in Kenya at IO@@ C , Kenya has already been under special observation for a long period of time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics , however , it has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose D@@ oping Com@@ bat conform with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ up .
for athletes of the country , won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD will always be charged , that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and it is supposed to give a significant ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian Athle@@ tics Athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport species , which has been systematically du@@ bbed .
Russia &apos;s athletes have been exp@@ elled by the summer .
West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ical couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and tune .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older child older .
she remembers his love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is unusual musi@@ cally !
and then Mari@@ as &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I am Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I and Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course , na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
she is a monster generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion , and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . McKin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ atism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we have the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ ert@@ orien went to New York , and the New York &apos;s inhabitants they didn &apos;t want to .
these are the same topics , and they are just as convincing as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school maid , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school cities that left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family shortly after she had to leave the war in war and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that this is the only good in it - as a Mah@@ al and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people go down to make this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school cities from the East London rose in a plane towards Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultan &apos;s family has been told that she has married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and was a widow within less months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in case of a election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton handed the judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next president is the successor of the late judge Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
an spokesperson on appeal said later that he would not have talked with Clinton if they would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not provide for ag@@ itation with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .

Tre@@ ats wants to do neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere together to release a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , da &quot; Playboy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; we need to return to a presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the Cal@@ endars .
women will participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish congregation reck@@ ons with mass destruction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the struggle of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection from Turkey to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , there could even be a few hundred thousand , &quot; the presi@@ ding Chief Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community is expecting mass destruction to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term , with tens of thousands of years , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already taken over the months of Kurdish high bur@@ gs with criminal action , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey have fled to the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup ch@@ ews the sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ elle ethnic Turks were added .
many will begin to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that itself takes place in the own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accused was accused of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the travel back to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government demanded that the government has positioned themselves &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
in Germany there is also an &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic .
I feel no more safe in Germany during the last months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will search for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as Gü@@ len trailer destroyed teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already faced the largest group of asylum @-@ recognised asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
at the end of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all accepted as a master ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , non @-@ ref@@ usal to pay before war , poverty or integrity .
asylum seek@@ ers to the Basic Law are politically , i.e. from government side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
the country code will not take place once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because of so far it doesn &apos;t go : summer holidays , heat and land battle - that &apos;s how it is .
the locals who are to be convinced of the election campaigns are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a natives , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are ready to distribute the posters , distribute air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and apply at the end of the vote , only m@@ üh@@ l .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass over the people over the people .
the hot phase , if you can tell it all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting , as strong new@@ comer AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his large posters .
he travels across the country , spread roses , and chat a little with the people , as it also did his legendary word Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
apart from that , soul has gotten cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel gives the fault at the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the AF@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; have acceler@@ ating the rise of jus@@ tification , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are doing wrong time on the right place .
she invited Angela Merkel twice in Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel is located in the northeast .
but the target group didn &apos;t agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity to listen to anyone from the other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North East @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ ounces the usual campaign conditions on market areas and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this means Kok@@ ert , playing only a &quot; lower role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you have turned their base on the land , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are just like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : barely present in the mountains of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ elec@@ tor pic@@ ks on his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in p@@ olls the S &amp; D Group was at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD still had a clear figure of 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .

B@@ 27 reconstruction : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the rapi@@ dity , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction of the construction work at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are everywhere praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty soft , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff about the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the South at the weekends as scheduled to the south , until the end of October will be all ready .
be praised , too , will be responsible for the construction work , such as it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald .
since the construction site on Monday he immig@@ rated to the south and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has also relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
escap@@ ing through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the natives of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ er@@ rain had sought to fight with more traffic noise because many shots are seeking and more than the sign@@ age .
what led to some of the trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limit has not been kept , the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant beliefs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself did the location even time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been two to three per minute lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 hours kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it was become qui@@ eter .
for business professionals at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg now .
in the cards , business people don &apos;t hesitate .
however , that the B 27 @-@ restructuring has led them to sales in sales , each one asks you to look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
who with the &quot; end customers &quot; has to do less , so for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences .
however , by the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decrease , &quot; but also dre@@ amt that &quot; of course &quot; the cat@@ er@@ ship is missing . &quot;
most exploited are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known crown , finds significant words .
this is already existence .
not only him but all guest facilities have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues increased to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street recruitment have been thrown by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff had to be released .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt stated on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there might be a financial compensation , otherwise , the inn will benefit from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they have also to dis@@ advantages that carry out through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something generous was handled .
at all Kl@@ agen G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his inn will continue .
after all , the family business has already settled here for the long time since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
that other family guests are now less frequent in more complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive it , it is also different .
at the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the largest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that is already brutal .
ever , in the name of terrorism , the terror is being screw@@ ed to laws .
according to recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a meeting status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all of his proposals were politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs at the launch of his new security package .
they don &apos;t ask anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
but the Minister of Interior said to him results , and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after recent proposals in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was given a little time before he presented his conclusions to the security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced that a new security authority should take care of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fact that Germany has to put several EU direc@@ tives to passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère started a second response to proposals that have not yet been to do with the SPD : he wants to put a symp@@ tom advertisement for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; and the CD@@ U man is dre@@ aming .
he still hold this for reasonable and challenging nothing , which I have no chance at the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
these are partly in itself : it plans rapid procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people in front of deportation .
refugees , which are targeted specifically to the country , should leave their smart phones and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ ventions for past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to be worse than so far - such as such , off@@ ences or papers consciously , to cast out their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
some even works un@@ balanced and can be open to questions .
and with some points - at the im@@ balance of Ged@@ ul@@ ed for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be turned out in turn that the assass@@ in was from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
there were also many people worried about the high number of refugees in view of the safety .
and things that do not work in people , let not inter@@ rupt in election times .
the internal security is enormous into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the failure is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD introduce themselves increasingly in the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last days there were between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy of some Unions internal affairs , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is working here for con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return of the double pass .
we have handed over the discussion in Germany .
you restart , be not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns .
if his own package is constitu@@ tionally relevant to all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; un@@ reasonable &quot; is still relevant for the coalition partner .
there is a lot of things that might care for battle .
however , the SPD also tries to pro@@ long himself on the subject of internal security .
Part@@ y@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes in a careful discussion and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel and@@ als , the number of suppliers are rising worldwide .
but it doesn &apos;t run in all markets .
there is a concept for the response to the call .
Volkswagen launches out@@ deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and many well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ cycl@@ ist can continue in advance despite its many brands and many well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand , VW , weak@@ ened all in Western Europe and resi@@ sted the sales of sales as that in D@@ ax has been listed in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries are nearly sixth away .
trade leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ened figures from July before all on two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , it has provided a purchase return in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote also bur@@ dened by the EU , discussing a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ate first , another Min@@ us is also standing .
major support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic record of the Lower Saxony will continue to pass through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0.9 per cent stands to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales by Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July continued to show a sales promotion .
in this time , Volkswagen delivered more than 1.3 percent of vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ates that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the upgrade of the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motor@@ ways to the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cause be legal en@@ quiries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen is now granted its German customers a guarantee for re@@ designed diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the editions of my investig@@ ating committee and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) declared to the Ministry of Ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power after the conversion has no deterior@@ ations , and all the typ@@ ed relevant vehicle values unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the opportunity to come back for example a half year after the conversion of about with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could be back on the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to avoid in the customer interest , that there is any other damage to do with any other damage , which comes at all with the ab@@ norm@@ ative sc@@ andal , as it was named .
therefore , Volkswagen is not using the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich spar@@ k@@ ers in future criminal cases - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who par@@ ked about 40 million euros in Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual incident and sees there no signal : normal par@@ agus would not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ k@@ icking pen@@ alties . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 Euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been around 40 million Euros , who could be lifted from one day to the others , and he could not toler@@ ate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie down to the central bank account and cause a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ rupt@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t go for any million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost he continues after the caus@@ al principle .
the cash simply lying in the t@@ res@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four sei@@ zu@@ res , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank .
most customers have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rations to other banks .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy circuit causes significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they alone carry out , be &quot; operating economically permanently possible . &quot;
therefore , some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal charges for deposits up to three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land with their skat@@ bank branch in 2014 had made headlines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , the main executive leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , &quot; T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; there is a cliff that is rich from the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a little bank to the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not known for further banks who calculate a de@@ position for inser@@ ts of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to the negatives compared to private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who actually buys Schall@@ platten ?
lon@@ ely males love middle ages .
before referring to the comment@@ ator , to over@@ take him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non @-@ Alle@@ mit@@ er &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement conduc@@ ts itself from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ reviewed recovery of sound plates is not focused on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that will welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects , but is due to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record recently , are all pres@@ tige according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older platform buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but does the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera during the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , before I remain standing , keep my hands and say something to say : &quot; so , let us take a look at this . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filled the buildings where once independent vend@@ ors were located - there is still a hand@@ ful fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand near to different men in such businesses and try to estimate their age and vegetables through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , I think of Sister Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men of middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collectors , I wonder ?
&quot; I already appreciate it , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I haven &apos;t followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy , when they had appeared and again sold objects , which he sold when he was young and ple@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
that is my master .
We@@ z , 25 who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records again .
of the conversations I have led , people usually have led to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy up their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phon@@ ica to recognise that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of par@@ ch@@ inn@@ s .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers rel@@ ates to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to push back to the stability of trusted records cover , of objects which are happy to wake che@@ aters .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as collectors and I think that it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a sheet stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look at very worried while passing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 who works at sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone first came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record top , so that I can imagine them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly puri@@ fied .
stop , dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women in middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz bars from the speakers - it is good to see such di@@ vin@@ ity in the customer .
none of them looks like strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are badly det@@ ectable if one stands next to another 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the business and consider the variety of plates for sale .
she is rather a p@@ add@@ ling bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so it is not a real option , &quot; she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates are ... &quot; she drives with a seduc@@ tive sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of turn@@ tables : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit to mu@@ te the jeans Hot@@ pants , I a@@ woke to group a group of young teenage cameras , which group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are just pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to express it .
it is pure &quot; label art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items may mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that gives the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in a turn@@ around in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , bu@@ stling and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist .
these people are likely to work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bee by record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while using the star@@ ving ga@@ ze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises not far from the shoulders of ru@@ ined men &apos;s middle ages .

French court ref@@ uses offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argued that the state should be fu@@ eled up to 72 provisional businesses , selling cigarettes or tea drinks , selling bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would like to be a parallel economy , which would not be paid by taxes and a fire risk and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported Association and other groups are not sufficient to offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture are absolutely im@@ measur@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas in a quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , the community is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes and an advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers during summer .

&quot; to me hon@@ estly , it is hard to be said to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser has to set up the next generation of vel@@ ocity : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash appliances are tested , which are especially effective effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in case of accident , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , highway building sites or san@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary themes , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure with a stationary aper@@ ture to comply with the speed limit .
but a durable mobile @-@ up can be too dangerous or costly .
the en@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data are encrypted using a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time as possible .
variable speed limits as well as the departure verb@@ s after time , road strips and vehicle size can also be used .
in high @-@ driving condition , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car cl@@ utch cl@@ utch .
so that it is not easy to cla@@ p it , it is lowered in measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ de@@ cks and by the way also disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the Bl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
also foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technology : re@@ juven@@ ated France 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain and silver pic@@ ks up in the 7 @-@ spe@@ ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji wins master class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday night at a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a score of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , push back , line @-@ run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of each color .
the defeat was rejected by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ Award of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals could fall back on it in the final day .
but regardless of it , Fiji had put a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago , she lost every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this folder will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began to be wonderful and made the attacks of G@@ BS from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell along and Co. as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went to top 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au came in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
it has hardly been the ball for 12 @-@ 0 and GB .
a majestic T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the hill of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua went on a touch at the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ attachment and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ st@@ led by another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while UK is still missing .
it is like that .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started a try for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long to support South Sudan , whose fans sang and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the i @-@ dot model with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle is heard that Fi@@ j@@ is en@@ cir@@ cled and the GB r@@ ushed down in the lawn .
in previous days , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and pushed South Africa in a cr@@ un@@ chy half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s Britain conversion .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late @-@ day tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony des English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer .
there will be no more engine gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing to last , 220 tough h@@ ieve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was also present as she became the second Olympic champion in a row without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport that laid up such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ rest , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ inside , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of homosexu@@ als , which reflects the way of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on by willing hel@@ pers to make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the coach who wouldn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day at all , when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said he ris@@ ky what is ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had good luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin to refra@@ in from the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right concept under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would satisfy .
so it starts .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the un@@ medi@@ ation of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a terrible morning so much more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck this week . that &apos;s perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much time this means , how much I and Helen and also have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could have no better person for coaching or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t help .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very imprisoned at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let it take part .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about 4 minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years have been exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ment Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small non @-@ restricted pot@@ able water @-@ agent as a model for the great water producers .
so it was written some time ago in the original of the original Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was arrested .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed Group was &quot; Bavaria &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the forced labor association , which was 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired from retirement age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ment group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5,@@ 500 inhabitants .
member states are the churches of church , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set in 1985 as a water @-@ wart , and was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary plan , calculation of fees and contributions up to emer@@ gen@@ cies in weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , plot processes in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the division of water pipes .
there was no stagn@@ ation and I have always resum@@ ed innovations because water was abundance and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ gs faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart @-@ bl@@ ut for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose environment , as if it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago he was present as a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group on the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , on the other hand , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ ver , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a loyal button .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the forced association .
but the greatest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the pi@@ ration at the high tank at Kirch@@ ner at a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night to work so that the towns could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained at once , because you filled the P@@ ett@@ stadt high @-@ pressure container .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was passed to Daniel Stür@@ mer by Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ eller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corriere della Sera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been known to her son , they believed they should die .
meanwhile , the eigh@@ ty @-@ old Ti@@ ago , however , was good forward and learn privately in New York , where it gives the best therapists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years when I sang along the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ak@@ os connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man moves on life dangerous
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was injured in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and wounded them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called for us and stated his life @-@ companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police pre@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , after him I will be publicly ti@@ led .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a glass roller .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it &apos;s a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man bears a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with themselves , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is to call .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship &quot; .
the victims were born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck first wanted to make no information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a special application agent ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Light view for German steel industry
the exploited and energy @-@ energi@@ zed German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial pres@@ sures , threatened by the industry , are threatened by the table .
it remain in the liberation of renewable energy management in the inventory of the so @-@ called y@@ mon@@ astic production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German general newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission , initially planned , initially planned to use steel manufacturers to use gases coming from the high @-@ furnace for their own consumption to ask the cash .
according to the German industry associations , the steel sector threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators be replaced in the steel works , it is an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to qualify for their suit@@ ability .
thus , the status Quo &apos;s status is largely established .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the reform of emissions standards , climate and employment aims are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel sector suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied , than the world &apos;s largest producers in China , in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand of mass@@ aged steel to the global market .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations d@@ umping .
during this spring , the situation has relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ ec@@ tom@@ y effect , for others , have accumulated economic prospects in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price re@@ covering is .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last the prices were stagn@@ ating again .
the industry re@@ acts on the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also in closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less steel than in the same year as the year @-@ old mon@@ at , like the economic association of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the crowd went back after the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation in the coming months , the association expects an increasing amount of orders in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing , sen@@ iors good
the singing has been accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , teaching the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after one rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , joy@@ ful and more livel@@ ier , she says .
by way , she does something good in her health and mind .
for singing is equal to several perspectives : a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular cooperation , sen@@ iors and social contacts can establish and maintain .
for frequently they solve social and family structures at the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to discuss and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be lab@@ orious in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
for this , sen@@ iors take a deep and controlled resp@@ i@@ ration .
who regularly calls his lungs regularly , not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to maintain the sound of the voice at the age , singing an optimum hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal labor community of the senior citizens .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies , people have committed suicide in long @-@ lying events .
when singing the head also demands special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time concentrate on its own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you lear@@ ns through singing in chor@@ us , H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I &apos;m a long time for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ c@@ eful people , who hears there when a sound is going on to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone singing out of the well @-@ known circle in an au@@ ch@@ ench@@ or , one can easily join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the Church leader .
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
if you like to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has something demanding - this is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect is the tail of cat @-@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
to their surprise , the r@@ ust did not leave the male too cold - but , in contrast , they kept the difference to the females .
female cats may recognize the nar@@ ration of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys at the r@@ ust of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of k@@ itt@@ ens which have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out of the Medical University and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the r@@ ust of less and strongly inv@@ aded young for the males either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams were distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
a total of nine adult males and eight females from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry were observed .
they were played for a rowing of little ones that were taken out of the lim@@ f@@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ enings of stronger K@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the low sample for sow@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not experienced their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rot@@ ated qu@@ icker to the loud@@ speaker , when this Ru@@ fe played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acts at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
there were also some studies that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they had already mothers or not , the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski jumping with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has issued an arrest warrant against the ru@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a terrorist group member of a terrorist group .
after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to see the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
already during the acceptance of the exceptional situation after the crash attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of nor@@ ms should not be com@@ promised .
however , this does not apply to those who susp@@ ects the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football is not just taken before the football .
the prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ b@@ r .
according to this , the South of the South America has been accused of being a terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ b@@ r is supposed to be the followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt at President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
although it is valid for 90 days , the state of emergency was still valid until October , in fact , on the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponent &apos;s Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Turks of the Turks wept with dramatic experience in history , the stri@@ cken re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be returning to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
its sporty value set the Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitors , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first game of season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season and secured the trop@@ hy for the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invented the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for a record master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also took place early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g it only ranged to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season op@@ ener as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shake @-@ shaped the base to the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .

despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others out@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio .
the issue of d@@ oping is determined before the headlines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented itself after a d@@ oping lock ( 100 meters of breast ) , was dis@@ car@@ ded and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a sk@@ inn@@ ed scene : with a lifted smile , she was still con@@ stituted in the hall and prov@@ oked her performance .
as a stand , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a jubil@@ ee tower .
but there are numerous other athletes that go to the start of the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was imprisoned for two times ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion was even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month sperm after taking the intake of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she defended a strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic fought the recommended intake and was locked up to six months .
the four broad@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive and closed for 21 months in 2010 .
a means to penis enlargement is responsible , Mer@@ ritt Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ole , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athl@@ ete have been identified as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid d@@ oping and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
as well as the 2008 Olympic Games , bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , he was returned to the CA@@ S International sports court .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world tran@@ g@@ ist .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested only in May , but may still be started in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion became evidence of taking a banned food supplement which fell the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA , and ran out on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood by woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they had suffered from the hospital and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
her home trip will be planned for the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , is not yet clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in relation to the local authorities , so Schn@@ au@@ ll .
Hua H@@ in , around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in an Nightlife two bombs .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ ater@@ in were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian woman , three Dutch , three Dut@@ chman and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early morning , two sp@@ ren@@ eg@@ s went up again , and the authorities were killed another person .
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
a taxi driver was injured at the Det@@ onation near the popular beach stran@@ ds in Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded in an urban staff .
according to the authorities in a flower set before the Re@@ vier of the territorial police went into the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was the name of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee free Friday before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express themselves as possible motives , but probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to detect a pattern on the attacks that is typical for the bombing of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
rather , it is out that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secret indications in the south of the country last days - but they have not been informed about the exact date and the places .
still be un@@ clear , what group behind the attacks .
the police rejected their officials throughout the country , safety around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings again , but they usually do not judge against tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the reason of reason bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage , the instructions of Thai security agencies necessarily result .
high security risk ( level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips in these provinces .
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) was added to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
these have been taking the military influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase bloody un@@ rest , keeps themselves confident that the kingdom has led again stability and order .
however , it is not successful in the military to get a grip of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok with a attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Con@@ stitu@@ tions .
after several country links , the Con@@ federation also entered the federation under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement against freedom of freedom of freedom against the freedom of freedom of freedom of freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ stitu@@ ent President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants has diff@@ use Islamic faith or from the N@@ ear East in extrem@@ ist mode .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass emig@@ ration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
Con@@ stitu@@ ency in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ fication &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority has been closely coordinated with the coun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to catch their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to express them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as legal extreme .
that is no stun@@ ned advertising for its own thing .
the propaganda must speak emotional .
young people are due in a particular way .
that is dangerous .
finally , there were reports from several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate told , he did not have any insights .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts this species have only been relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the AF@@ D - through certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist table are changing , and the extrem@@ ist becomes more extrem@@ ist .
the decisive thing is , if such persons have the control of the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase of rectangular off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years , that there can be legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other rectangular groups or small groups form to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing motives .
however , a clear@@ er @-@ wide or European control of rec@@ ti@@ r@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level , or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Ma@@ ate talked about that there were many convic@@ tions to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that had not be politically in@@ different from right , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Freestyle , there was no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run for media attention .

the fees per cubic meter waste will be from October 1 , 2016 for the area of se@@ wer@@ age Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World War 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) , and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage costs will then be increased once again , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was established in the permission of the budget by the Council office Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these se@@ wer@@ age re@@ covers .
the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to maintain the facilities cost @-@ covering plants .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a re@@ ten@@ tion of charges for se@@ wer@@ age of the market community was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overseas and sub@@ missions from the previous calculations were to be compens@@ ated .
the disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate increases , Schmidt founded it with all three se@@ wage plants to be relatively small establishments with a very low water waste , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for repair of several thousand euros would be excav@@ ated .
waste water waste will be slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , in all three systems were not recently fallen in a considerable extent due to their age , san@@ itation and repair applications .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system in the az@@ endorf waste system .
in the p@@ umping station , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond water plant L@@ opp had to be extended after almost 20 years of operation the first clari@@ fication of se@@ wage , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge and an additional aer@@ ation can be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs incur@@ red according to the new calculations of calculations . &quot;
same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still clearly below the current level .
stone houses made clear that in the low wage plant in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; fully compreh@@ end . &quot;
thereby , Schmidt announced that the market community of great entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed in the se@@ wage plant in the last 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ valent , especially since they could not expand the supply of the waste @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al waste land by these plants , because it is concerned about de@@ bug@@ ging facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by Ani@@ me , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to race .
with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and with identi@@ ties on such a way that is already adjacent to Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ asted , self @-@ toler@@ ating tools which generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies each day .
all patches are to the public .
the Snap@@ chat filter have critic@@ ised criticism in the past , in which they were accused of propag@@ ating the App Black@@ face to propag@@ ate white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week a filter proposed a filter that gave them b@@ ang@@ es , false teeth , and ev@@ ap@@ hr@@ ased che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy has been referred to a larger problem , that the company has diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after the Snap@@ chat took that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an ap@@ ologies : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced r@@ is@@ tism , the filter re@@ minded of inf@@ rin@@ gement c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread about the photographs that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and blind said un@@ comfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very contra@@ sting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effect .
it shows that the filter is not gel@@ ding , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ed extre@@ mes has been drawn .
the Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ per@@ ate .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration steam , of conference rooms , up to Hollywood and equipment , which we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - which are di@@ spar@@ ed in the race as their older opponent - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium , decided to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account called others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said they believe that road @-@ related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the entries in the Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu had critic@@ ised the big part of white , only male leadership and finished its attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions where they are sure or feel comfortable to tell what to say . &quot;
others share your opinion , a complaint that is mostly un@@ answered in the Snap@@ chat .
the company releases no figures for the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a speaker , the company has recently agreed a personnel responsibility that focuses on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In turn , she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military demonstration : ISIS secret information , Committee on Congress of Congress
member of the United States Central Command Res@@ identi@@ fiable information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it was allowed to have allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces , intelligence agencies and military bud@@ get@@ ing , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence service , which reported how to change their ass@@ essments on the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news articles that were typically cancelled by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com , regularly reported a posi@@ tional picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
guide errors in Cent@@ Com to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed analysis problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct clu@@ es to change reports that government peaks have given orders to change reports , it shows how analysts predi@@ ct itself from their pre@@ laws , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress revealed considerably more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of the Kansas City Congress , said in a written opinion .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the top of the Central Command has changed the direc@@ ting reports to play down the danger due to ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans proclaimed the Task Force in life after being played , analysts predi@@ ct themselves concerning the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during investigations .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Defence Ministry .
on Thursday , Democratic members of the news report published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com announced an outstanding process for the creation of high @-@ performance ass@@ essments on Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest @-@ day Democrats in the committee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; said the mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House with Cent@@ Com analysts on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon &apos;s Secretary @-@ General , who were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon pre@@ fers of the Pentagon , gave evidence that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the general spec@@ torate is still underway .
but he also admitted that &quot; experts at times have quite diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year passed the question , to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the hearing about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font of what was reported by George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to make up thought about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker announced that the statements of the Government banned air@@ strikes against the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its outstanding positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the US won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , that &apos;s what they know : the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 at the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place to remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will hit the final lap of the first round on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will receive the first and second place within their group .
the first placed , the strong Dutch will lead to a little longer in the way that the other group will lead .
whatever the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex in their success story , four years after they landed in the past 12 places last year .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years one Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London we have now .
we have the rowing all around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the clos@@ eup .
India had gone without victory in the game , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the play between 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a Sprint with a flat ball about the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Olympic Games
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel stable and un@@ avoid@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is , as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod , which will protect from the wrist@@ bands to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queu@@ e in Coff@@ es@@ hop , excluding Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ver@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is a Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Women of Women with dimples , would certainly have been under these known names that can be sent to Prime Time , when it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ ent .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame isn &apos;t illuminated every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for a long time .
but if I have a humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me take the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so spar@@ sely perceived that many people who had questioned , did not know that it is a Olympics .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had gotten a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ines jump on a certain side @-@ side , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School as those sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an adult enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the me@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to s@@ wollen lad@@ ders - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
growing winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
according to the official Olympics program , you are rated to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ und@@ ingly athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts of med@@ alists must go on to gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes go and back , up and down at the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another height of the TV transmission : die Welt or Olympics .
the targeted pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I feel at the watch of these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers an air break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is spr@@ ing@@ ed .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ unes , seem@@ ingly heavier than an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ less to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition could be for the Olympic Games .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ ons of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
NBC is ro@@ oted as part of a afternoon blocks two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the loss of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and objec@@ tivity of male athletes - as it suggested to the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his after air , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an alliance of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia , beat on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that some prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia going to break together ?
over the past ten years it was one of the most stabil@@ ised countries of Africa , a solid network of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government attacked the country and continued in more areas .
last week thousands of people fell on roads and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was un@@ comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave evidence that polic@@ emen shot dead prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , videos on the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , are showing young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for human rights demands a further investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian together to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was more than a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sent@@ ers effective .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or were driven into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil use up to the cube with regard to power of ruling coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this tender , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts predi@@ ct that separ@@ ati@@ sts , like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden who were forced to benefit the turbul@@ ence in recent years and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of understanding after years ago , H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns explo@@ de itself under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were increasingly more frequently , and improved the Internet services .
even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies who are hiding where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ian states that they were so prot@@ ested to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ä@@ onen , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly originate from e@@ op@@ ia , mainly in the politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ lands .
but this is changing just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was a prime minister until his death in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly fu@@ elled in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Northern Ethiop@@ ian region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the tig@@ ray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to the analysts , which was apparently stolen by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ or , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest was relatively fast over .
development experts praise Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ aries , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intention of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an official city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media .
analysts predi@@ ct that protests and other Western allies bring in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ y@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently ha@@ sted that it has closed this basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to cooperate in a volatile area already .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ ration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim President Obama had been &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the final controversy surrounding the campaign by continuing his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication cast new questions about the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is capable of communic@@ ating and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its co@@ h@@ ors that endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase of protection in the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the suggestion on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t the president and Mrs. Clinton ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical .
contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ations completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct his campaign in the economic situation because of an accident failed .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he have found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ kas@@ mus to his defense .
at the end of July he drew up strong criticism when he meant that the Russians should take care of Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; Of course , &quot; I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method enables Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans are arriving on how they arrive , and if necessary &quot; clear , &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist that observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements made enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
rather than shar@@ ehol@@ ding the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone , because its environmental values declined .
a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a guided tour in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses to understand his critics , or to understand his testimon@@ ies wrong .
but while it focuses on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sh@@ atter@@ ed his loyal companion to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princip@@ als , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN @-@ interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani was asked about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s correc@@ t@@ ness , if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama had an almost unknown , small organization , he called them am@@ b@@ än@@ sts , completely false and so it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government served as a foreign minister in Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister to spread it ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them to ride on each of his words , and put against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked for Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps excuse than just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once p@@ ushes the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in William@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but 15 years of good coffee ser@@ ved .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business designed in the summer of 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people acted as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ur wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also real@@ time .
a re@@ vit@@ alized ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered to deliver money for a new out@@ ward , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment again .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there is natural her@@ esy .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodriguez said that he noticed a st@@ oned stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also p@@ ushes through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became aware that it was on the coffee and on the culture in ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she &apos;s drinking coffee again , even if they found a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea that is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there in front of the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ter always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came home to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ ch and they prepare my all @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he didn &apos;t win a Gro@@ ll that the soap shop has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , a special soap for di@@ b with the ch@@ illed coffee of coffee shops as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu to Polish and Rodriguez , said that he has planned to make them soon , so that his new neighbours will welcome you .
the location also has further advantages .
a ör@@ t@@ ely Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell the cold baked coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on an adjacent building site .

the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took lunch in the O@@ val Office .
when Fein@@ schm@@ ecker had President Roosevelt a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , both of both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , be@@ ak snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the business since the IP@@ crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , be@@ aut@@ é a fresh cheese , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the reporter went to h@@ ack@@ ers , this couple found the couple for a discussion of the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; abundant food were very popular , &quot; said brick .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made of an ingredient and somewhat cheap prepared by the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have laid in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
during the years before the Great Depression was the table in a American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male rocks and served freshly baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were Americans who sent food to star@@ ing food during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the way , with which the country went on to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans was a central , stored theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talented co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was the same as the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were considered to be stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful way , &quot; perceived bri@@ ck@@ man , as ch@@ efs un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients could hide under a cor@@ di@@ ous sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat that had been the heart of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction that had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes prepared bricks from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household business .
as never before , or ever since , bud@@ get@@ ary economic policy - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by sending recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; budget policies &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical le@@ ak@@ ages .
in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in the kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the million@@ th heavy man from the world to whom it has become .
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine such as fish with cucum@@ ber @-@ sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost g@@ ilded dining room and wore a tu@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ time .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ ze his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the owner of a budget with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most deeply prepared food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , going to deal with food was rejected , once the country was back on the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said bricks , as well as science in food .
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans e @-@ in law better understood - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brick minded : &quot; you &apos;re really getting sick . &quot;
there was the wind yard .
after the plate at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared out , they pulled out a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the p@@ au@@ gh@@ ty , the President Roosevelt to lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no found cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each one di@@ pped some spo@@ ons in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E took three times a desc@@ endant .
like a Can @-@ Do budget , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed at bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bomb attack on the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that had so far saved the lives of 60,000 people so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers make their own life on the game to draw people out of tro@@ dden homes and make the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civilians who shows him a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a child from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians at the shining symbol of the horror of the war .
but as heroes never saw himself , he said : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have four versions of the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on the S@@ anna research expedition .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ie get offspring with 150 years old .
the Greenland tube flo@@ cked on the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is just 1.@@ 220 metres far .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
of this long @-@ term lifestyle , however , seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any event of Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ ro@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland ha@@ ie stone will be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they appear only in winter only in winter .
researchers know a little bit about the Lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ ie .
her time @-@ shi@@ fted it , when she took six animals with a broad@@ caster in front of Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
prey make these shar@@ ks yet : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had lu@@ red the ja@@ w of a young polar bears .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the ice@@ berg and are looking for cad@@ aver to tor@@ ch out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , during the biggest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens of Ha@@ ie with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks which contained the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 compared to the lens .
their birth was therefore , therefore , after the early 1960s , when nuclear @-@ w@@ ret@@ inal tests lie larger quantities of this radioactive carbon impact into the atmosphere .
in the 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters length of the smallest animal , the lens core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all major Greenland ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ eters long Greenland an old of 335 years , while the record @-@ Ha@@ i with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters could even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females will only get offspring when they are more than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 top tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with Multip@@ lication obviously has at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ sion@@ es live primarily in icy waters , is no coincidence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 years old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon stri@@ pped a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals live on savings .
you sit down later - and then slower .
in order to keep warm water in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal leaves the heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with an grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as far as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in one long life .
building site in double pack
with topics around the building of B@@ auen , the Municipal Council is concerned in the most recent meeting .

after the plot , par@@ ap@@ oration and exclusive questions are clari@@ fied and the applications could be put on survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the housing areas &quot; street road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) for applicants is nothing more in the way .

Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has the best opportunity to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit &apos;s referendum , it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass , the approval in Great Britain has so far enough .
this just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs .
the Lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a 10000 new job positions at the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance fund E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , have less moment@@ ous than the ECB for the financial sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg remains a large fund sector , cut but as well as Dublin in infrastructure as well as in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am much easier to reach the airport thanks to the great airport .
in addition , the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the r@@ ents for top @-@ quality commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main .
furthermore , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city will accommodate seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial market for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; follow the I@@ W .
but in spite of the Bre@@ xit vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business schol@@ ar .
for this also the power relations : in London , according to numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released their tax declar@@ ations for 2015 , this resulted in the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million finished for ben@@ evol@@ ent purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their term in the State Department .
Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in an opinion .
in a c@@ turn@@ able contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false fail@@ ures and returns to his previous promises to release his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by the law .
dump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Cohen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor , to CNN that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , among other things , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already promised that his ref@@ usal questions arise regarding assets , its donations for charity organizations , its business@@ men and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton released a video on the Internet and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republican tr@@ ump , his tax return .
on Thursday , she also spoke the subject of an address to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and release his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poli@@ tico has reported that tr@@ ump was not paid for two years or only very little taxes on Friday , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked his seat at the Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Park , Tr@@ ump to meet their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had under@@ gone a tax examination of the IRS and have been afraid of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax declar@@ ations of the 2015 Clin@@ t from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 have been covered as a reward , unlike the majority of all Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ t dividend raised and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
natural Prot@@ ector in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to stop eleph@@ ants in which inhabited settlements - they throw the con@@ doms of them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already strengthened the idea in years , together with the US natural protection , trained together with the US natural protection by train volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent approach to protect their houses and harvest without having to hurt animals .
before , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the telephone day that is devoted to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change of their attitude within this con@@ greg@@ ations , where they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields , without damage the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ moon Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition cord is turned aside .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst into the air with a button and spray fine dust to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option represents a b@@ aller who sho@@ ots a golf station in the air and caused a loud , light explosion .

however , the building on the new building of a sales area on Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the building , however , rejected the city council , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new tra@@ ders , but at this location in exp@@ on@@ ated location on the Rhine River , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director hits Berlin Hotel , because Israeli di@@ alling code was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli code in Berlin since it would have requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ tag@@ ine @-@ documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country @-@ selection list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility of choosing Israel via an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , that stood behind , dis@@ band@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election will be deleted , &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ counted from this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this in Germany has borne in exactly this hotel chain , is even a even bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation needs this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large reson@@ ance on the Internet in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ ordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it had given the alleged ar@@ tis@@ ation of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it in another entry in which it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the no@@ is@@ ome Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations from itself and called the incident the incident , &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include a direct assignment , &quot; awarded the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code was added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade against prot@@ esters Brazilian students
students beat together on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police replaced tear gas and rubber @-@ mol@@ ding against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to cast off the students , which led to the police rubber @-@ mig@@ rant and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
in accordance with the proposals of the Federal State &apos;s Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the Pre@@ liminary President Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the recent protests happened several days after demonstr@@ ators to support demonstr@@ ators in the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ded President Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff , which had been revealed by a vote of the Senate in the office .

according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , shared the am@@ bass@@ adors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , another trade structure is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said .
it noted that the trade set between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives amounted to around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel destinations , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : drop the beverage market in the forest oil
a pre@@ dat@@ or is practic@@ ed on Thursday evening on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the load of a fire@@ weapon called for three dark @-@ dressed persons who had raised their faces , from the employee of the beverage market , the issu@@ ance of cash and fle@@ eing then on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money was exploited , the police does not share with them .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is immediately accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market from accessible and bad .
the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich Engel@@ bert &apos;s path and from opposite the car park on gravel car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Sch@@ la@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who are at the time of the crime time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who stand in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should ur@@ gently sign in the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims on the gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch of St. Anna were on the way to a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages were carried out together .
in order to over@@ take the period up to the next Rom@@ wall@@ ets of all ministers in the age of two years , the Minist@@ erial Quali@@ fication Round St. Anna decided to prepare for the preparation and carrying out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage aims at last year , and we decided to finally go to the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on the Frei@@ burger Münster was a special pilgrimage .
16 Min@@ is made from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Christmas @-@ bedded were on the way .
in the evening , parish Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and distributed the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b , it was driven by rail to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster &apos;s un@@ ser@@ er loved wife , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ weg came from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short pulse with different prayer , songs and fon@@ ts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made on Feld@@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches , and again to sing together a song from the pilgrims of pilgrims together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags came to pass on stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting road , however , had to grow at the heat of around 500 metres away and climbed again afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the served reward was a common grill on the bad@@ ger in the evening .
after the morning of the fourth pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing track to Freiburg .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms into the house as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night at Vel@@ od@@ rom in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took part of the anch@@ or@@ man , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he has been home to home a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y repeated the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place at the London World Championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this time in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ re a gap that tried Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the winning four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner were in the qualifying rounds a Olympics record , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ ons victorious the New Ze@@ al@@ ander victorious in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des left behind him after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation that drove him into a higher speed , to slow down and it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert , and Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des fell on when they came to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a smooth comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have set up a Olympics record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that he fell down on the track after a weak start .
he returned to this statement later , and there was no ob@@ jection of England ri@@ vals .
this time there was no problem with such a victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that &apos;s the case of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels some lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Four @-@ Four @-@ Kilomet@@ ers race .
they came to the goal in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus .
he was cont@@ ested with evidence before the qualification , as the function@@ aries called to him to measure his body size .
in the respective Women &apos;s Competition , the tomorrow will continue and ends , av@@ anc@@ ed Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team will rely on its strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fet@@ ch Sh@@ ar on medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute Domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have driven down .
play@@ mate played in the background , such as the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ ers and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you see the first night of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , the legendary reputation of G@@ BS , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
the future of the melting of Portland , based on lifting the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply and thus making all the delivery contracts , as the sup@@ plying energy companies .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the system .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could possibly be dom@@ ino effects , as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa opened the Point of Henry melting , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of investments in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the complex .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin America , shared with that there are three additional owners to termin@@ ate their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller proportions .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant continues to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continued to continue that the treaties so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; should come into effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period , so they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L divided with that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination &quot; period .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of mot@@ as ... the melting of the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting &quot; would not be affected .
the US company said that there would have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is an explanation , why it has been re@@ signed from the contract .
analysts war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually consumed around 900 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one car@@ ving of reality TV @-@ star , it is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner c@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , I brought me the sight of this code to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) and ends with a classic conclusion : you have all a surprise party planned .
this represents the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ pers of a children &apos;s broadcast ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ her@@ ans started .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim she likes what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles more of a video band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing ( 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be expected to see that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ ak@@ ened in front of the official dis@@ closure .
women who were already on the cover already include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the fashion &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ able model &quot; of their generation - is described by the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people related to reality stars or teenagers from today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything was given on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women that character@@ ize themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like any success either .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always curious in the fashion world .
in June , the one @-@ sti@@ ge Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner critic@@ ised her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cook high , when the message came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it does advertising to your Grun@@ er by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her handmade images of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in her free time it &apos;s time to see in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres are 16@@ 0.000 people every year .
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid centers are rejected annually by the municipal centres worldwide , while the industry accounts for the effects of further medieval cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar methods - rejected on free legal advice and legal jurisdiction .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been out@@ law@@ ed , are ready for additional cuts .
as of June next year , it is expected that these legal centres will lose more than 30 percent of their federal states .
the director of the municipal centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of municipal centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse than the decision of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands &apos;s municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people of important services that you need , rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ ob@@ sc@@ able and persistent debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems with correct manner and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help you need .
the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people need to be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any assistance .
we demand the General Prosecutor and federal jus@@ tification as well as the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise this central short@@ cuts , so that the people need help you get involved in legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled her commitment to raise funds for legal actions on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centres and its customer communities as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter , before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of the country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
among the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the gover@@ ning parties of the SPD and CD@@ U .
this illustrates representative surveys of the opinion research institute ins@@ a for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue straight ahead in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed by 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the AF@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens rose by 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again into the s@@ words of the agricultural day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not present in the country each with 3 percent .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD &apos;s SPD only reported to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
they still blasph@@ eme the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could return to return , the pirates would miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram , and it was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
at the beginning of eight Meg@@ abytes , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be sufficient for approximately two rare resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros , lovers can buy the equipment still on the Internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the fair trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the western bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a quantity : SMS and emails were sent and received , even by fax it was to reach communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , if also agon@@ is@@ ily slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found .
quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average price of one smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could sign in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has since been different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile sphere of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wrapped around Microsoft .
the market stands today , which all came a lot later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , it is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for about 5@@ 55 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ ongoing businesses of countless app providers and the telecommunications corporations come .
the whole industry has been developed around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on mass market came first in early 2007 , on the back then , Apple chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a musical player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use all by touch screen .
the winning suit of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the offspring .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian vend@@ ors such as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ understand@@ ability .
today , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone at times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only available in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just like at the time in 2012 in London , when we run a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benef@@ ited from playing .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by creating new possibilities for local people and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already make 10,000 new teachers , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of the Heath@@ row &apos;s extension is too large .
I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the branch had been wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heath@@ row answers every answer to him .
as the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of capabilities and employment to leave the airport as well as in whole UK .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which made a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , was chosen from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we continue to direct this Olympic spirit and to expand Heath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ game &quot; regarding display block
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money come to one of the software manufacturer attempts to handle ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat@@ ching and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post , in which it has ha@@ sted that users could update their filters in the program to block again ads in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertis@@ ements to identify it displays , which is part of the page advertis@@ ements to complain .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle has already been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest companies in the struggle has settled in the fight is a strong indication of how to obtain wor@@ rying ad cur@@ ri@@ sts for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people are used worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users to access Facebook over their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenues Fac@@ ebooks .
the company doesn &apos;t have any effect on advertis@@ ements on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of income from so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile as a worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad pre@@ ferences tool &quot; to have more control over them on them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying a new filter because they would like to block content on the page , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control in the hands of the people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at an presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d close to midnight .
a woman placed in the dark &apos; in an act of despair , on the street and were met by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Schweizer@@ in at the age of 49 , which was of several vehicles , including a truck driver , would have to kill himself .
it died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , said to report .
it was opened in an investigation procedure which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter presented the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoided ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the At@@ tor@@ ney must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the driver will not be drawn to responsibility .
in each of the two cases , one person in the dark ones ran on the highway - was decided that drivers don &apos;t need to assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of neg@@ lect had been acquitted when they had taken a man and killed , who was one night in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the street .
the court noted that the police officer -- which had answered on an emergency call -- was a justified way -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was most likely to be inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA Climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , which res@@ emble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have been revealed .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and still slowly stopped .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably rejected more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and shake fast injuries .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was a matter of 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ates her daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella , in order to prevent the surface of a bulk of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth are today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution earlier by planet research .
although it was probably resi@@ li@@ ent , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back to carbon dioxide with a deadly impact -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy enters as train@@ ers of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy entered the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey operations at the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will seek immediately after a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ acy , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of summer long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs to bring it to higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a complic@@ ity in decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanks for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him just the best for the future .
during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was honored as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League .
he led the club on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minnesota and missed in each of the two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart Roy four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again , putting strike out
the labour force on the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are exposed , while all parties sit for a new discussion round at the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the Wood field service Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ launch the current release process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is written in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop several full day sessions during the next weeks , which will begin at the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contrac@@ tor in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the enterprise provides the necessary space to come through the market turn .
Shell has released a part of thousands of people and plans to exp@@ ose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities with the British Energy enterprise BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , economic situation under pressure , an economic situation that was strengthened by the decision of the British in June to rely on the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliamentary Committee Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest employment disp@@ utes in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler ™ space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the Stern@@ enh@@ ances of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers , as well as stars in the stars are rot@@ ated to different rates as well as in which connection the rotary tim@@ rooms are at the planet .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ lings , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which emerged about 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they now turn the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mat@@ ured stars come from star@@ ches .
because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ igned , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of any apparent star@@ cks -- as sun @-@ spots -- see .
the latest catalog of rotary rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors , rather bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ base of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as the ide@@ ological laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar presses in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would like to learn more about us before we want to learn more about how , when , when and why stars down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star joins in
the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
after its emotional review , the 41 year old pro will carry out the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodriguez became the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 , he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature is 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ tor on 31 December 2017 he served as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player , it pays for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones in 2005 .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
but the 41 year old are not likely to be recorded in the bas@@ eline of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his occurr@@ ence outside of the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed due to an execution in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az with the Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy and sympathy of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; che@@ eks with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are first d@@ oping accidents
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping test , he must not start the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping accidents .
a caught athl@@ ete would have gained almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ oping attacks have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstac@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky were positively tested and excluded - directly before the start of the athle@@ tics Championships , these messages come to the accident .
for Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping distances .
the International Sport@@ court Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympics in local time on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.0@@ 9 seconds it missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the fore@@ ig@@ ning more than 50 m Freestyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
the national band@@ age take the matter &quot; very serious and demands for Ch@@ en full cooperation with research , &quot; zi@@ ed X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ court Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news on the positive sample in Dan@@ ek@@ owa caused the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is supposed to act with the banned substance to act EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ vision@@ ally sus@@ pending , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow disc@@ usses immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not pull the right turns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulgarian stand under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , about all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter may not be part of the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation in Rio .
the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had a positive impact on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
they both cont@@ ests , however , they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the whole Russian crew to start an exception because of systematic d@@ oping d@@ oping the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swim sport the earlier verses in China had also su@@ ck@@ led for fierce fights between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will be handed over to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Var@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a meditation on Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ ams , &quot; he said .
sun was positively tested for the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ ine , but only had a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ ashe@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers her solv@@ ents
programm@@ ers of ma@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have at least once , some multiple victims of a attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already been at a Ran@@ som@@ ware recovery .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to make use of the required solution , to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mailing software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in corporate networks .
if they have been successful , the potentially too high @-@ end rans@@ om is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of pollut@@ ants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the do@@ ers discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
only private users were the goal , but the change to corporate att@@ ach@@ ments took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once upon a victim &apos;s computer , they are looking for long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mailing .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in form of cryp@@ to@@ isation bit@@ coin - over@@ point .
but where private users found the personal photo database on the game , it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage caused if a ran@@ som@@ ware will strike .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break down business activities , in case of a case there were people in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attack , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of patient ac@@ utely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the operation .
h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the user surface and the contact with the black@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , direct access websites free or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and , private professionals are rede@@ emed by a few hundred euros , companies must pay a hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ mel@@ sky @-@ black@@ ening the h@@ ack@@ ers will always be professional and share the work , explains security experts of the SO@@ PH@@ OS Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is likely , however , that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building , to the real black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits produced by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ press@@ ors then seek more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh @-@ purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , rede@@ em@@ ing the set of a crime and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs .
the payment is per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the criminals bear the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that guarantee their data better .
more than 50 per cent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful path@@ ogens , the perpet@@ rators are rather threatening with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the damage of damage according to type of data still a multiple higher than before .
even the perpet@@ rators in future could take a completely new goals on the Internet of Things .
on the Def@@ con Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they were able to get with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the heating of a der@@ art blocked heating so many sacrifices may be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of the heating in the future will block a factory road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ inclusive
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds pretty much , but the HR @-@ V that has been built on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved highly flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond much space , it seems to be close at any place .
the materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant , just the cockpit @-@ top is falling there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a suitcase set of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l with hing@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be screw@@ ed up like cinema chairs and offer the storage space that is height of the floor up to 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk can be well loaded , but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V up to 300 Nm thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
a regular basis on the revers@@ al road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal jus@@ tification should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are travelling on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road farm is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler street turn the right track for a distance of 700 meters .
drivers can then ad@@ ore directly from the Hammer Street right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , thereby improves the total of the process in the versatile section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the Administ@@ rative District , representing Münster @-@ West .
driving distance on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the return path goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g and sometimes also .
the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 is just before the start of Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic will only be hang@@ ed on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer required the required load capacity , especially to record heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck , and the related con@@ ges@@ tion , can &apos;t say the responsible state @-@ operation can &apos;t say .
however , for years to expect : because the bridge has an official resi@@ due period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal jus@@ tification , the country is deliberately un@@ wanted to pay the transport we@@ aker time in school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday in the building site .

rain instead of stars : hope on weather repair
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany to Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .

relaxing night : tips On sleeping disorders
in the evening , one turns around for ever , at night it is st@@ ately awake , in the morning it &apos;s far from the wake @-@ up and no longer think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanent as non @-@ recovered .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can under@@ lie them diverse causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eds , board member of the German Society of Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ oral and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , thus a input and per@@ sever@@ ance disorder .
as far as sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , the board member of the German Reich Medical Association with practice in Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
it can also stick organic , psychological , or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medications .
not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of a different condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early watch is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors need each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and begins bl@@ ur@@ gently , via everyday problems and worry , gives , white an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should we sleep with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and is affected the day should go to the doctor if she advis@@ es .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ paved , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy or medication - classic sleeping tray only in exceptional and not for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
in Germany , there are hardly any time in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ bers , head of the inter@@ disciplinary medical Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should pay attention to the specialist doctor at bed@@ time , advis@@ es white .
this can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in the sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for investigation in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in illness of disease , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of sleep disorder , Fi@@ bra@@ id explains .
we don &apos;t need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please make a lunch sleep , &quot; Fi@@ bra@@ m@@ ns .
after extingu@@ ishing you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose of nose , chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
moreover , a camera on the ceiling is distingu@@ ishing for sleeping .
how can I gr@@ ate the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screw@@ driving , where you can set for a better sleep .
white counts on : regular sleeping and rise times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch television for sleeping , alcohol , and at night not at the watch - then one begins to count immediately , and that is quite and not promoting .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in the swimming pool
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting separation of the DS@@ V team at Olympic .
in December 2014 , he brought gold up for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put forward his criticism via Facebook in front of his ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets € 20,000 and a jun@@ ks of 150,000 € should be surprised , nobody wrote over missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funding system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control , however , is very good .
this makes us not compete with countries that promote very much , and do not work with D@@ oping as accurately or even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he had to start com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler has to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who can not be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , must not participate , &quot; the choice of choice in the Hamburg who has now also operates an ice@@ berg .
airport : Bande was arrested by luggage
professional slide at Airport Düsseldorf
on Thursday the arrest of the Düsseldorf police fired the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the crime suspect had committed several T@@ ash@@ - and carrier steels as gang .
at 21.@@ 30 a.m civil servants recognized in the area of the airport to Düsseldorf a gang that was known for polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since mid @-@ July and were collabor@@ ative , working , and especially professional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Speci@@ alists of Crime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have traveled to the Di@@ eg@@ ulation of crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lenti@@ l pools , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in works at the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east to the west , one comes along playing fields , a refresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed at the facade of a gray house . &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl that is to be demol@@ ished soon , it will be built in : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are preferred in the last weeks but preferred by burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of le@@ ase contracts , on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence has been referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after on 22 June the rooms have been cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ cy@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police three weeks of official statements , closed parts of the road and held visitors from the road to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown domestic owners are the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the spati@@ ally had been illegal , and a day later police and building workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and hab@@ itation .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking late at late .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood , a primary school and nursery schools are located .
left violence is not the main attraction of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has been here three children , are generated above all by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and tri@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to det@@ ach a majority of police protection in front of v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police have existed between home@@ ers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter , which also has a lower average income in comparison to the rest of the city .
even household appliances and the resulting residential projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including nearly the entire mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ am had been cleared under a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral lin@@ ers from around the world : they now share its inhabitants of GDR @-@ times and former home network .
this also makes it noticeable among the mi@@ xes that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in designed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were cast with color exploited .
no other road was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neighbors can see that as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to polic@@ emen , is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house near the disputed 94 years , cannot be a speech by uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what violence is concerned , it is more important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the famous burning cars also show it straight in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
therefore , it was so important that the natives get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly occupy the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through secured new buildings in former building blocks that opp@@ ose the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are all con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well booked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction may I have absolutely not gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should we do if one never stops any one ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even in the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding about colours , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the Hau@@ tes and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who is going to be aware of it - just like someone who attracts in a pub area , can complain bad about noise .
all characters only have been asked with the names beginning , not to be called with their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee agent
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
moreover , she is a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ics supports the team of administration by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , administration , authorities , and who else is missing .
Reg@@ ine customer of working groups indicates that the hon@@ ors are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is there , the busy wool mel@@ t@@ au , which has a problem mainly .
so , some - less mo@@ cked as much rather than the multitude of desire desired - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place .
the administrative building with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous wool of wool .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
most of all , it is around organization to work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as networks as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent job for three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ - and full official actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem is it has been recognized since some time , apartments for connecting flights have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connecting door .
you must under@@ take the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for construction , rent or renovation of this accommodation must carry the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility takes place from the coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so don &apos;t work so far , if you rely on private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , general dwell@@ ings must be amazed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and useful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ keeper , do not work for non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very ti@@ dy , how Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work leads to a positive effect on the community .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of sense .
so we need offers such as sport , contacts with locals and in particular language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and honorary citizen can also jump .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it takes place and can make it useful , for example with language courses .
who , sometime the feeling evol@@ ves , he could not work in Ur@@ bach anyone , could not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate .
the significant majority are motivated .
but there are also problem solving problem cases , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two be afraid of radic@@ alisation , also in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a remains of the risk and does not want to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ per are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they feared the fear that the assass@@ in brought them completely to call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we need to keep main and volunteer in the region and in the region after activities .
in the background , they always have a new push of refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question , the policy is afraid .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet , where we would like , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was also fast@@ ened to integrate the current people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
however , when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
