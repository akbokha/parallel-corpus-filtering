<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections are, however, in case of tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns that the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will go back massively, and he is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said against it: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes were increased for the rich, says she.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which they must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost password.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, you could still have partying internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive up coal transport in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in the areas of protected areas, to terminate the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands: "a country will create the power of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA don't want to insulate from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton is calling for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to be, then he says he could not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to leave the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him forward, so the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished one crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin will take his Turkish opponent in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I can't convert the intrucks that Ankara will most want to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the towel, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked as a malicious smile, and he barely radiated warmth, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke out of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report written five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better improvement.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable kisses showed that Russia's leaders had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, since it was committed by an alleged boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be difficult to rebuild, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed, when the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the serious test the accusations were benefited from leading officers that Erdogan's own family benefits from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, who will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin's President Erdogan received the apology that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire is clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all the friends that he can get after spending the last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">The terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitates when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television has predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West, since its reaction to the tried power outpaced as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the sustained groll comes across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to move from the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian leaders won a bonus for sure that he called for the attempted coup attempt by the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well noticed for Moscow, a self-understandability that has changed even a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one of how it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of exterior sides,": two countries who stumble from the west and treated badly and is now banned.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of the first call both President at the press conference said they could not even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey were able to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey turns off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now that we do not pursue global objectives but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own congregations, and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that his six Nations Sponsoring will not continue to continue, and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop the Bank of brands, for how do we concentrate on inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy director since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later became the manager and Chief Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of authority on legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that Chief of Staff will return on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile of the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was praised as a potential president, wants to lead to the Russian environment policy - pushed to great scepsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated item - one could almost say - to trust the post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I've been chairman of the Russian President's President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of Russian Security Council and how Putin was a member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was once believed that Ivanov could lead to the second term of President of Russia because a third term of Putin would fall into the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering firm from a truly epic scale with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total almost 79% of the entire bridge decks in their place and the last part of the deck is located in Rosyth a concrete bed for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first shutter is a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">At this fantastic project, the shutter is facing the pioneering high-depth and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we needed to close the gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling in the northern slopes of 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child don't go outside without going outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to play on screens, has been complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go there is about to get people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the first time, the screen was on TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am sure of course, of course, on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later it developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture sunk interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries became postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the player with their smart phones are looking outside and looking for Pokémons that were followed by a GPS once they were once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase of steps taken from the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users pursued, divided the Washington Post recently, with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring "30 minutes" to take "from the sofa" and "beat each day" beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nonetheless, the importance of sport can't be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are regular sports, reduces his chances to get to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to run them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt for new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are moods that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its appeal and use the use of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in real world and will help many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I consider under the Women's Olympic Games in the Turnen, and that is out of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three Turns, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls from other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, the catholicism is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has reaffirmed the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years the number one was a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics winner and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world masterin Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as she was unexpected, but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for women with an individual campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're experiencing the top of this sport, but you don't see gyms around the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics is only four tower girls in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns will unite the expensive sports and Turner first line in private gymnasies, which are maintained by parents who are planning for training, alignment, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner receive its entire training and this is a devilant and long term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have trained free and affordable gymnasies in Harlem for more than 15,000 people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-quality things that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art and benefit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinacy for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which bring thousands of young girls to get to the gymnastic and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic Team golds and thank you for so many young girls motivated with different background to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler undergone the immune system and Würgereflex of a serious test - taking place some of the reproacherest and most striking places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travelogue Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk failed his wake to a Euro-piece, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a purge button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to ensure the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the end of each object, he used a Luminometer in order to show oneself and show us what he is going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed by the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, scatter the purge of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveled through the world and ate alone and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">Public railways to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets, the task was definitely the immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I have all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probeline showed a Luminometric score of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer count generally amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to do after their Luminometric count exceeds 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows bacteria numbers in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I have stayed in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll find nothing here, because it is inside disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish products of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and simultaneously declares the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did mad Brainstormings, which thus ended that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" "" "let me say," "" "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have directed to him, like the beeked Russian toilet which will be shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to use it and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm happy that we recorded some of these dirty dainees on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were involved in lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, that they may contain at least occasionally products that contained lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">The country code will not take place once again at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of so far it doesn't go: summer holidays, heat and land battle - that's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced of the election campaigns are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a natives, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers are ready to distribute the posters, distribute air balloons, distribute flyers and apply at the end of the vote, only mühl.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass over the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can tell it all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting, as strong newcomer AFD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old, and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses, and chat a little with the people, as it also did his legendary word Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, soul has gotten cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives the fault at the blossoms of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We create" have accelerating the rise of justification, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are doing wrong time on the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited Angela Merkel twice in Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel is located in the northeast.</seg>

<seg id="23">Otherwise the North East-CDU renounces the usual campaign conditions on market areas and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means Kokert, playing only a "lower role."</seg>

<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-elector picks on his fellow soldier is also self-larvingly: "you have to go there where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the S & D Group was at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD still had a clear figure of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the polls, could be able to make the jump into the rural day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of the holidays, giving their campaigns on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is called the State of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green elector picks up to native censorship according to native stimulants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys Schallplatten?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely males love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before referring to the commentator, to overtake him under the pseudonym Non-Allemiter's age with rough insults, this statement conducts itself from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-reviewed recovery of sound plates is not focused on a boom in millennials that will welcome the realism of physical objects, but is due to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record recently, are all prestige according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older platform buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But does the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera during the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit, before I remain standing, keep my hands and say something to say: "so, let us take a look at this."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filled the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand near to different men in such businesses and try to estimate their age and vegetables through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I think of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I haven't followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy, when they had appeared and again sold objects, which he sold when he was young and plead.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback and prompted to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have led, people usually have led to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy up their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of panels?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to recognise that record shops offers a soothing community of parchinns.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers relates to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to push back to the stability of trusted records cover, of objects which are happy to wake cheaters.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors and I think that it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff from a sheet stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who have bought a record last month, they haven't heard it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look at very worried while passing through a stack of Bossa Nova.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42 who works at sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone first came here and said," "" "I don't have a turntables, but I would like to buy a radiohead record top, so that I can imagine them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicous.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly purified.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop, dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women in middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz bars from the speakers - it is good to see such divinity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks like strange, but brand psychic traumas are badly detectable if one stands next to another 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the business and consider the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is rather a paddling bumblebee as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so it is not a real option, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from one computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates are... "she drives with a seductive sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of turntables: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit to mute the jeans Hotpants, I awoke to group a group of young teenage cameras, which group for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are just pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to express it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "label art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items may mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that gives the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in a turnaround in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, bustling and in Onlineforen exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are likely to work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebee by record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while using the starving gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises not far from the shoulders of ruined men's middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued that the state should be fueled up to 72 provisional businesses, selling cigarettes or tea drinks, selling barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would like to be a parallel economy, which would not be paid by taxes and a fire risk and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals offered by the state-supported Association and other groups are not sufficient to offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais Prefecture are absolutely immeasurable. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-he Rugby came in the final on Thursday night at a corrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck with a score of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-stepping, push back, line-run and roher strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was rejected by the not too bad TrostAward of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals could fall back on it in the final day.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji had put a 15-man team in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it's probably not that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This folder will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be wonderful and made the attacks of GBS from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell along and Co. as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went to top 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau came in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has hardly been the ball for 12-0 and GB.</seg>
<seg id="16">A majestic Tackle of Mitchell stopped the hill of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua went on a touch at the right corner and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-attachment and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prestled by another weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while UK is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time by and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long to support South Sudan, whose fans sang and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-dot model with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle is heard that Fijis encircled and the GB rushed down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">In previous days, Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-final with 20-5 and pushed South Africa in a crunchy half-finalist match from the race - Britain's Britain conversion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late-day tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony des English 15-Aside teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer.</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more engine gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing to last, 220 tough hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was also present as she became the second Olympic champion in a row without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport that laid up such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.ter unrest, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletinside, who glide over the surface with the elegance of homosexuals, which reflects the way of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing is a battalion by willing helpers to make the difference and it was no more comfortable than the coach who wouldn't know whether he would survive this day at all, when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky what is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had good luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin to refrain from the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right concept under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would satisfy.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the unmediation of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a terrible morning so much more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was a centurion at the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck this week. that's perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much time this means, how much I and Helen and also have worked Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could have no better person for coaching or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very imprisoned at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let it take part.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about 4 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="12">There are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor in Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set in 1985 as a water-wart, and was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, the budgetary plan, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergencies in weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding events they called the start-up and inauguration of the new well (1994), plot processes in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high tank (1999), the new creation of a central computer control (2004) and the division of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no stagnation and I have always resumed innovations because water was abundance and drinking water the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio, she praised Gögs faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used himself with a lot of heart-blut for his water-purpose and he has lived the water-purpose environment, as if it would be its own company.</seg>

<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the restructure of the forced association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the greatest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the piration at the high tank at Kirchner at a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night to work so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained at once, because you filled the Pettstadt high-pressure container.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of drinking water-purpose was passed to Daniel Stürmer by Lauter, who joins the succession of Rupert Geller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing, seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, teaching the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After one rehearsal, she feels balanced, joyful and more livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal to several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular cooperation, seniors and social contacts can establish and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequently they solve social and family structures at the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to be able to discuss and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be laborious in the positive sense, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors take a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly calls his lungs regularly, not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to maintain the sound of the voice at the age, singing an optimum hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal labor community of the senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By Liedtexte and especially melodies, people have committed suicide in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing the head also demands special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on its own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you learns through singing in chorus, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I'm a long time for something, I will better and watch over me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 sinceful people, who hears there when a sound is going on to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone singing out of the well-known circle in an auchenchor, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn directly to the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you like to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something demanding - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by Anime, but some observers say that it is unsensitive to race.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week a filter proposed a filter that gave them banges, false teeth, and evaphrased cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy has been referred to a larger problem, that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after the Snapchat took that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apologies: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the US won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I don't belong to people who keep their goals in memory." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">However, that's what they know: the Americans lie at 4-0 at the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons on the first place to remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will hit the final lap of the first round on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two teams will receive the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed, the strong Dutch will lead to a little longer in the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game is going out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex in their success story, four years after they landed in the past 12 places last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years one Hockeyracket in hands (their two older sisters played the sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008, since they could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a setback from the closeup.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone without victory in the game, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the play between 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with a flat ball about the left flank, then moved to the middle and lute the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Olympic Games</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro will feel stable and unavoidable, a rapid relay between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod, which will protect from the wristbands to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in Coffeshop, excluding Simone Biles, Katie Levery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Women of Women with dimples, would certainly have been under these known names that can be sent to Prime Time, when it would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fent.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame isn't illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me take the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so sparsely perceived that many people who had questioned, did not know that it is a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and had gotten a athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolines jump on a certain side-side, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsSchool as those sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an adult enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the metoonous trembling of his never to swollen ladders - but also the Grazie of the gyms and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Growing winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hreal and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympics program, you are rated to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-undingly athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists of medalists must go on to gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes go and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another height of the TV transmission: die Welt or Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at the watch of these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an air break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is springed.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunes, seemingly heavier than an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortless to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition could be for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endrons of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is rooted as part of a afternoon blocks two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the loss of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and objectivity of male athletes - as it suggested to the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expected his after air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an alliance of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia, beat on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that some protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years it was one of the most stabilised countries of Africa, a solid network of Western Europe with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government attacked the country and continued in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fell on roads and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was uncompassionate according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave evidence that policemen shot dead protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, are showing young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopian together to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was more than a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissenters effective.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or were driven into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil use up to the cube with regard to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this tender, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts predict that separatists, like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden who were forced to benefit the turbulence in recent years and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of understanding after years ago, Hinköchelns explode itself under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopian were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were increasingly more frequently, and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still communicate via Internet Proxies who are hiding where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian states that they were so protested to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äonen, the Amharas, who mainly originate from eopia, mainly in the politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was a prime minister until his death in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly fuelled in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Northern Ethiopian region, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the analysts, which was apparently stolen by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razor, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months and this period of unrest was relatively fast over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praise Ethiopian leaders for their visionaries, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intention of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an official city, led by Tigray and hatred toward the Tigray will always be more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronyflights across the neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently hasted that it has closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to cooperate in a volatile area already.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin Gratration."</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the final controversy surrounding the campaign by continuing his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification cast new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans in the Republicans, whether he is capable of communicating and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its cohors that endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase of protection in the actual position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the suggestion on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton ISIS.</seg>

<seg id="7">Contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusations completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct his campaign in the economic situation because of an accident failed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clint's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he have found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew up strong criticism when he meant that the Russians should take care of Mrs. Clint's emails, but later he declared "Of course," I said the sarcastic. "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements made enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rather than shareholding the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone, because its environmental values declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, showed a guided tour in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocative statements, he accuses to understand his critics, or to understand his testimonies wrong.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while it focuses on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps shattered his loyal companion to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent principals, gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN-interview of Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on the Sanna research expedition.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie get offspring with 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland tube flocked on the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is just 1.220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of this long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" at any event of Greenland, which could be 392.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Schrolein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist presumed long that Greenland haie stone will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they appear only in winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know a little bit about the Lifestyle of Greenland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-shifted it, when she took six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make these sharks yet: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had lured the jaw of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the iceberg and are looking for cadaver to torch out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, during the biggest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens of Haie with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks which contained the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 compared to the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore, therefore, after the early 1960s, when nuclear-wretinal tests lie larger quantities of this radioactive carbon impact into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all major Greenland haie had normal carbon-14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimeters long Greenland an old of 335 years, while the record-Hai with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females will only get offspring when they are more than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 top timeters probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland haie with Multiplication obviously has at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methussiones live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenlandwal, in whose bacon stripped a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals live on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">You sit down later - and then slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal leaves the heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with an grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as far as many descendants as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the melting of Portland, based on lifting the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will terminate the energy supply and thus making all the delivery contracts, as the supplying energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the system.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are standing on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - may be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could possibly be domino effects, as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa opened the Point of Henry melting, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of investments in the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminum melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latin America, shared with that there are three additional owners to terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The complex is located in the majority of a joint venture by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller proportions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL goes out that the plant continues to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting means," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to continue that the treaties so-called "securing transactions" should come into effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "so, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the power supply." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on revenues to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL divided with that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination" period.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of motas... the melting of the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting" would not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that there would have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force in 2010, even if it is an explanation, why it has been resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consumed around 900 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generator, it would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the klischeepers of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to participate in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people related to reality stars or teenagers from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything was given on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women that characterize themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only available in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like at the time in 2012 in London, when we run a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benefited from playing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will come again by creating new possibilities for local people and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already make 10,000 new teachers, creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension of the Heathrow's extension is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will blamate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The branch had been wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every answer to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an option to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion on witty growth and leave a legacy of capabilities and employment to leave the airport as well as in whole UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which made a £11 billion most expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, was chosen from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow is also one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we continue to direct this Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs, which can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was most likely to be inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA Climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, which resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere, and still slowly stopped.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably rejected more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and shake fast injuries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was a matter of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exponates her daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like an umbrella, in order to prevent the surface of a bulk of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth are today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles evolution earlier by planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably resilient, Venus -- in the course of several billion years, was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back to carbon dioxide with a deadly impact -- the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been at a Ransomware recovery.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to make use of the required solution, to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>

<seg id="7">If they have been successful, the potentially too high-end ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of pollutants," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>

<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the change to corporate attachments took place in the past few months.</seg>

<seg id="16">But where private users found the personal photo database on the game, it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage caused if a ransomware will strike.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break down business activities, in case of a case there were people in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attack, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of patient acutely.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims," "" "Don't pay, you only promotes the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user surface and the contact with the blackpressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, direct access websites free or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, private professionals are redeemed by a few hundred euros, companies must pay a hard-negotiate and pay five-digit totals to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransommelsky-blackening the hackers will always be professional and share the work, explains security experts of the SOPHOS Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is likely, however, that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building, to the real blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits produced by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackpressors then seek more hackers to spread the fresh-purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, redeeming the set of a crime and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals bear the spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that guarantee their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes poll trust that Ransomware can be able to defend Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful pathogens, the perpetrators are rather threatening with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage of damage according to type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even the perpetrators in future could take a completely new goals on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Defcon Conference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers, as they were able to get with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the heating of a derart blocked heating so many sacrifices may be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future will block a factory road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty much, but the HR-V that has been built on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved highly flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Fond much space, it seems to be close at any place.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is not only a suitcase set of 453 l at high-quality and 1026 l with hinged back rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be screwed up like cinema chairs and offer the storage space that is height of the floor up to 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be well loaded, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V up to 300 Nm thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should make his work very quiet, however.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegulators responds to road recognition and drosselt when needed the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity exists only for the top-quality: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket lie below the armrest and therefore are somewhat perceptible to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped Top Diesel are alright.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one turns around for ever, at night it is stately awake, in the morning it's far from the wake-up and no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults, sleep disturbances and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanent as non-recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can underlie them diverse causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeds, board member of the German Society of Schlafforal and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnie, thus a input and perseverance disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">As far as sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, the board member of the German Reich Medical Association with practice in Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It can also stick organic, psychological, or behavioral factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early watch is often common in depression," "" "says Welet." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, waking up every two to three hours and begins blurgently, via everyday problems and worry, gives, white an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should we sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and is affected the day should go to the doctor if she advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is smitten, tired, unpaved, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleeping tray only in exceptional and not for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly any time in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fibers, head of the interdisciplinary medical Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedtime, one should pay attention to the specialist doctor at bedtime, advises white.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in the sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in the sleep laboratory physician, for example, in snoring with respiratory problems, in illness of disease, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disorder, Fibraid explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make a lunch sleep," Fibramns.</seg>
<seg id="30">After extinguishing you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose of nose, chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, a camera on the ceiling is distinguishing for sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I grate the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screwdriving, where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White counts on: regular sleeping and rise times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch television for sleeping, alcohol, and at night not at the watch - then one begins to count immediately, and that is quite and not promoting.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the" "" "No-Go-Zone" "" "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence has been referred to as the" "" "No-Go-Zone" "" "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms have been cleared out on the ground floor, the Kadcyschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrol the police three weeks of official statements, closed parts of the road and held visitors from the road to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown domestic owners are the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the spatially had been illegal, and a day later police and building workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and habitation.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking late at late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood, a primary school and nursery schools are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main attraction of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has been here three children, are generated above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood, they share the care of rising rents and trirification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted to detach a majority of police protection in front of vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police have existed between homeers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter, which also has a lower average income in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even household appliances and the resulting residential projects belong to the "Kiez:" in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including nearly the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been cleared under a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly become the magnets for tourists and electoral liners from around the world: they now share its inhabitants of GDR-times and former home network.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes it noticeable among the mixes that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the reconstructions in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in designed discs or freshly painted facades, which were cast with color exploited.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often together with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbors can see that as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to policemen, is almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house near the disputed 94 years, cannot be a speech by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what violence is concerned, it is more important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also show it straight in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is no criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the natives get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly occupy the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through secured new buildings in former building blocks that oppose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are all condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well booked," "" "she says." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee agent</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogics supports the team of administration by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups, administration, authorities, and who else is missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of working groups indicates that the honors are more than thankful that Deuschle now is there, the busy wool meltau, which has a problem mainly.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less mocked as much rather than the multitude of desire desired - meant, as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administrative building with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a jealous wool of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all, it is around organization to work with people on site and behind the scenes, as well as networks as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehr- and full official actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it has been recognized since some time, apartments for connecting flights have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connecting door.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must undertake the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for construction, rent or renovation of this accommodation must carry the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility takes place from the councillor to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So don't work so far, if you rely on private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, general dwellings must be amazed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and useful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housekeeper, do not work for non-profit work - and that's motivated and very tidy, how Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work leads to a positive effect on the community.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But he does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of sense.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers such as sport, contacts with locals and in particular language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honorary citizen can also jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain the refugees that it takes place and can make it useful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who, sometime the feeling evolves, he could not work in Urbach anyone, could not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem solving problem cases, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "it is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two be afraid of radicalisation, also in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "what mancher naive call." "" "a remains of the risk and does not want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helper are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They feared the fear that the assassin brought them completely to call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we need to keep main and volunteer in the region and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new push of refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet, where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher was also fastened to integrate the current people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
