Obama welcomes the Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as over Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting also aims to discuss the conflict with the Palestinians and the &quot; Two @-@ States solution . &quot;
for years , the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant municipal construction of Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu &apos;s def@@ aul@@ ts to the peace process .
by the deal of Obama in this deal , the Iranian nuclear programme continues to deterior@@ ate further .
in March , Netanyahu had spoken at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was re@@ valued as a Aff@@ ron@@ ed by Obama .
the speech was not talking with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the parties in Israel .
in an emergency call given to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb said with a terrible voice in the police that he shot his girlfriend and that his brother had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could find on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note that was placed on a white block , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb l@@ acked up to the school grounds in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who already had 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed according to the police , to his office , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University Poli@@ sch@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all University staff have heard a shoot at 10 : 18 .
he said , Lamb has made the fat@@ eful emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when police seized him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to proc@@ ure themselves a picture of which Lamb &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well what the students and staff who knew him , helped out to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students asked that they were rejo@@ iced in his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt herself had mentioned later in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ ines too proble@@ matic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised lamb , said that he was also a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
later , the Delta State University had asked for a be@@ ur@@ ation for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year , he only taught two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy suggests that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to be presented as Assistant Professor .
vice President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that could not answer even more .
after the escape from the Campus police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track later when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , later himself killed herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile to the south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still going on .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
later in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which produced 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , teaching geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in early ped@@ agog@@ y early in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la hair@@ ston said she was 15 and the lamb , 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School and he was the cool guy guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was the Women &apos;s Black back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls are melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously together some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate by a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick house that attacked a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced only 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ We@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he was never met later , but with his daughter Abig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s when he and Abig@@ ail appeared three years ago in a summer @-@ year @-@ old market .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a faint illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night in the night saw September 5 for the last time , after Lamb ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica game ended in front of a spar@@ sely audience .
there were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the premises and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ ester .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first term seminar program and speci@@ alising in American indigenous and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell said , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ le@@ light memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache during the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to return our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct the police , saying that Lamb told the emergency call , after he had shot Schmidt and that lamb out in his not@@ ary call P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two have ever gotten married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theatre to the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is beside me , and it is gradually becoming clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN boss once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to join unite and integ@@ rative negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the Assembly &apos;s Assembly to meet this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ end@@ our in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban has called for the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity in Syria with the development of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Steps to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to stamp him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move from the upper edges in p@@ olls to the bottom , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys demonstrated by Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously discuss what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course , it is too early at the electoral term .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts have shown that , at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys took the leadership to the rising Herman Cain , of which no one gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC , and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to kick up their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey values , pointing to that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps carrier popularity has turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
approximately three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa found last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey by CNN / OR@@ C , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans had said that they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he had the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same excitement as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , that tell the same about p@@ umping ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have believed that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is the proper temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ voting state of the nation - the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 Independent individuals say that his temper@@ ament is not the White House permit , so ABC / post office .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when putting their gent@@ ry Blossom , Republican voters are tr@@ ump for real .
if asked if you &apos;re in asking who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C , four out of ten , Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten received money to J@@ eb Bush from ten ends of July .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination , would win only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , however , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will demonstrate a thri@@ ving campaign than chat .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans had collected a further candidate , tr@@ ump still strikes almost everyone .
some experts refer to that the shred@@ ded field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps management , while the anti @-@ collapse support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates diff@@ uses .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump , support multi @-@ cheerful support .
he picked 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , especially Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of border Paul , John Ka@@ herself and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take entrepren@@ eur at 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald &apos;s tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters that Tr@@ ump support , say they have awarded their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest opposition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans argue that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald &apos;s ump in his election campaign , two months ago , immigrants from Mexico had been &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic exc@@ ite of Tr@@ ump is decisive in His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans to keep away from the Republican Party and to damage the orient@@ alist effort .
but according to the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans argue that they coinci@@ de with a ump on questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ strations over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of Republican voters will fall , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also anger@@ ed at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ stated in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ by@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with views of the North Sea lake .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top can be reached on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is still limited , &quot; i.e. in the study , is therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special layers is one square meter the most costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the benefits does not occur like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate company Angel@@ &amp; V@@ ölk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located here as an exception , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ time sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a barrel .
a happy hits by Thomas Müller served the way to a comp@@ acted 3 : 0 at Olympia Pi@@ raeus - then she ran .
a convincing pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League season .
the world champ@@ ions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have created a dream start in the &quot; mission of Milan in the Wit@@ ch &quot; chair by Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her first tak@@ ing@@ play in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in warm atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers Dou@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ z ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th star success in series aims to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received the Champions League on the Champions League on the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ Aid of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who lost one of the flan@@ k remembered of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame in front of the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich retained word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without gloss@@ y .
pir@@ ate had won his youngest six home match in the Royal class , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , we stum@@ bled as Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , having beaten up in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up duo with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went cour@@ ageous , with their adv@@ ent efforts , but often seem harmless to work .
the attacks were often led by playing on Lin@@ ks@@ .@@ Douglas Costa who was seldom heard about the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was lucky in the left eye when his flan@@ k struck the upper half @-@ field on the left side .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms , Ide@@ as Brown suggested the poles of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct payment , the keeper ordered Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ th . ) .
although Bavaria reg@@ ained its usual domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ raeus could be con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
in Tor@@ h@@ ter Manuel New he was leaving .
for instance , when he had a shot of Ide@@ as about the Lat@@ te L@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola lost a quad@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , was initially sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had given the green light only after finishing the final day , said Sport@@ au@@ dition to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else , that &apos;s not malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the proposed Dem@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late to Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and later made it clear 13 minutes later , at the El@@ f@@ meter Müller replaced one more .
before the game , it was celebrated to be celebrated in the stadium .
after a small group of partly , Bavaria @-@ fans had apparently inc@@ ited the followers of hosts Pir@@ ate with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went down with impact cr@@ ot@@ ches against the Munich Post .
there was at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has higher risk of losing its teeth
those who smoke , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this is near a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : when deci@@ ding , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a considerably increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non smoking , smokers at the risk of losing their teeth too early in order to get the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental break@@ age are c@@ aries and infections of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ tis , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , bet@@ s the authors .
the connection between smoking and teeth go back to frequency g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , though , smoking is also increasing the risk of cavi@@ ties .
people who stopped smoking could reduce the risk of dying in a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could , however , last for ten years , until the endanger@@ ing went to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people to become non @-@ smoking , the project leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking per@@ si@@ eving the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and j@@ ars and leads to our knowledge as well as good dental health until high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by dental violence , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is increasing the risk for early tooth time .
the new long @-@ term study is the result of the findings .

EU Commission will propose a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system to de@@ vis@@ age the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
the controversial private sh@@ lamps for disp@@ utes between corporations and states are therefore supposed to be replaced by a transparent system , which in its functionality is significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström said at his performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de has set the proposal to set up a European negoti@@ ating position to free trade calls with the US .
the German Government has announced support .
the largest Free Trade Zone in the world will arise with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration report imple@@ ments that EU states and the US have shared independent judges for a new International Investment Court .
equal to parts from the EU , the USA and third countries .
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
she would allow it to up@@ lift the sentence .
so far , the operations agreed on each other to refer@@ ees , a g@@ ushing up against their jud@@ gements .
discussing the past months , it has become clear that citizens with the old IS@@ DS system do not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
after long @-@ term , she wants to go into an international investment property .
there might also be clari@@ fied in disp@@ utes between the Chinese companies and the EU states , for example .
the investor &apos;s arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ essness regarding the companies of damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or cut through a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first opinions , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate .
it was critici@@ zed by the fact that it was not to apply for the already tra@@ ded free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ ir ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission , considering the reform of essential points , earned the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Company of Business Business@@ Europe warned against limit the business opportunities in the business through too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises may be advant@@ aged , it was welcomed .
when the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement of TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will continue to be completed on Wednesday .

delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is fli@@ pchart , based on the shy , acting US state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is virtually seized by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he tells stories from various places he always imag@@ ined on the map , which explains his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and frag@@ mented songs .
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens beha@@ ves as a wonderfully creative irrit@@ ation .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appears to be clever , very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but always b@@ lown up at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a twi@@ light series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be occupied in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has been released and had a positive effect on certain expectations .
if Stev@@ ens re@@ acts on here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , a musician will return to the series in New York .

the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and l@@ acks no annual list of the influential music media .
after all , Stev@@ ens went on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) highly extensive electronic sales growth .
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ened broad@@ ened , however , by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ence .
from long time , the smaller clubs went off , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful Spec@@ tac@@ el from Ne@@ on @-@ Fore@@ ver and the fluorescent medium .

although almost 2000 guests have banned their chairs in their chairs , the much more mature thei@@ rs returns back to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without giving a word to the audience , the Group enjoys excellent musician through the wide @-@ raised album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and it is possible to throw it off the &quot; record . &quot;
until the addition of Stev@@ ens Stev@@ ens would come modest , acou@@ sti@@ cally , some older songs and ten@@ ds to be under ro@@ aring applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ny
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is awaiting the debut at the Prime Minister in the Prime Minister .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will set his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gments , and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day , keeping its performance by the media probably and the Labour MPs from the vicinity .
he demanded &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership because it comes after his appointment to a member of the att@@ ach@@ qu@@ ettes and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the celebration of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and stands at the centre of several cover stories about the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national an@@ them , has attracted attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; standing in resp@@ ect@@ fully silence , &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hero@@ ism at the Royal Air Force in the air Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told in the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Opposition were originally supported as leader .
policy correspon@@ dent in BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also within Labour &quot; will be st@@ ack@@ able as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on position to the European Union and the Lim@@ its .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C conference , said Labour amend@@ ments to make the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ ents ministers , said that the Party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that they should have only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade above the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another political principle , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced ideas for Mr. Cameron and given him more than 30,000 questions .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that it is estimated to have both &quot; impact stability &quot; and the streaming with contra@@ sts , and to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow economy minister when he does not take part - for instance , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues have taken the word occasionally , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the home , to discuss the issue .
when he became leaders in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; which often is linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ ter , but a few years later he admitted he had failed .
since it was first broadcast in the year 1990 , the questionnaire filled with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership under his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argued that she has become a caric@@ ature and need a far reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated changes in the UK
the pound has spr@@ inkl@@ ed according to data , showing a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the target group SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % over the same period last year .
this percentage has been the fastest and earned app@@ rais@@ als for the time of a interest income .
the pound increased by over 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the most remarkable share in the market and made a jump of 20 % when the acquisition of Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v arrived .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and produce brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ is , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were down to encouraging messages from the competition @-@ Group for luxury goods giant o@@ chem@@ y 0,9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts new sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry and recovered growth again .
shares of G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of packaging and paper Group MON@@ DI included the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sachs had &quot; sell &quot; its assessment for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports increased 3.1 % after the sports bet@@ ting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half of the year .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endangered .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a minimum wage for UK labour would mean more buying power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that these purchasing power will be equal to the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
the costs could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Peg@@ ida @-@ Poster for Lebanon on potato d@@ ön@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the m@@ ashed potato , which the Ol@@ m@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owners Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster by the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat are put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had been seen by chance on television .
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
this idea was established in Lebanon by the Patent Office in Munich .
there , it has recently been protected as a utility label .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer does , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to reveal .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better with it , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also takes place in its customers .
Met@@ cash starts Dis@@ miss@@ al Con@@ si@@ diary for the Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall campaign
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign &apos;s campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia to defend a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di &apos;s opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealer and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who disper@@ sed in IG@@ A shops and shop@@ keeper who sell off @-@ off tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash published additional details of his defence strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler takes advantage of food , alcohol and equipment .
it is a lot on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia would account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop @-@ shops , and generate higher winners as met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
pro@@ curement in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial , and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to approximately 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts predi@@ ct that Morgan Stanley is out that Al@@ di will catch some five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all the available actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley said that IG@@ A retail@@ er will lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and from Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and sales revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food and at the amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and markets rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ ray refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass .
since 2010 , IG@@ FA &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food trade , which has fallen by 43 per cent , is fallen by 43 percent , which reflect the operating loss of debt with respect to sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler being tax@@ ed and investing more than 150 million $ , to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week , and IG@@ A single retailers to improve their shops thanks to fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the wholesale increase and loading sanitary programmes are to be excav@@ ated and hopes for the first time in 2017 will return to a profit growth rate for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is sponsored by the president of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is rather deser@@ ved praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; collabor@@ ative damage &quot; in the shortest storm about his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and ear@@ ns rather praise to the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly rather praise to his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special KS &quot; , came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification match in Cincinnati I soon had to be separated by Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice through the refer@@ ee , where Harrison called : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have decided to strike the baby . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a ra@@ mp@@ f was fo@@ iled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly def@@ ected .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite jeal@@ ous , the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke down a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose of the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved in the U.S. OP@@ EN extremely well , even in the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of appreciation .
he got a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little to be treated confidenti@@ ally .
he is a very ripe 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never experienced a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is a strong and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take the Kyr@@ gy@@ ro on the important pre@@ limin@@ aries , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all but he sec@@ ures to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent feature to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all around the controversy &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick has made very quickly the A@@ scen@@ sion , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have made it . he clim@@ bs in the eyes of the lim@@ el@@ ight , but we try to help him to make the consequences of his action , in which he can only think about it , I hold for appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee Crisis : Hungary explains to the border , closes refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency , and controlled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and refra@@ ined all that they tried to come into the country illegal . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants did re@@ acted in an Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and did a Serbian government re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence , were filled for an unknown time in a country strip between the two controls of the countries and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the ins@@ ults against the Hungarian stand@@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that immigrants from Hungary would return from Hungary , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally harm .
in the coming days there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nation block with a strict meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who had under@@ estimated Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would make that the EU countries would record a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however , its hopes are not on the soon @-@ bal@@ ancing action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency rose on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities have given more powers to prevent the crisis so that they could accelerate road blocks and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to , said that his country also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of immigrants from the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that there were even prisoners in the competition to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war guidelines , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also viol@@ ate human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government intelligence Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters by Associ@@ ated Press have been heavily armed by armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people while attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come across , inj@@ uring the fence , they are now in custody to custody and are accused of off@@ ences of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are allowed to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday after a tractor vehicle with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important Gren@@ zen@@ los near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , to edit the data of people and sting a crowd in order to move there .
some 20 managed to get into it , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would be food and water to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into a national survey
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thus continues to lead a double @-@ digit margin in a democratic race at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is opposite to the bottom .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre@@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced until he was displaced to the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters for the election .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which Can@@ did@@ ates will support them .
but Clin@@ ton supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost some demo@@ graphic groups in a number of demo@@ graphic groups .
Clinton keeps a huge advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these have been reduced .
your support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders can only return with 5 points .
much benefit for democratic voters under the age of 50 has volatile , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton has a huge advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the general election say they would be backed by enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support her with some au@@ ditions and a further 15 percent would just support them , as it is the candidate &apos;s candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s recent supporters are especially thrilled by their .
the views are more mixed in those who are not supported Clinton - just about a quarter would it enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that Clinton backed with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ton supporters want to be questioned in an open question , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time to be a woman president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
he also mentioned her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) by Clin@@ ton .
consent to dealing with problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the Presi@@ dency in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked to take a vote on who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on top .
much more than half of Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers tell more than half that Bi@@ den would be his second choice far ahead .
however , bi@@ den decided not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead to S@@ anders , with 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters have seen Clinton as can@@ di@@ ers with the best chances to gain choice ; however , this figure decreased from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in that measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; choice &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , at the question of what is more important at a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the eligi@@ bility .
similar to the last month , no single democra@@ t candidate or potential candidate can be seen as un@@ acceptable for the elec@@ torate of the out@@ sel@@ ections .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in voters of the party &apos;s parliamentary elections .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den inter@@ sec@@ ts the lead with hon@@ esty , such as Clin@@ t &apos;s strength .
thirty percent of democratic voters think they are honest and trusted , twice as many say this is about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of it .
democratic voters in the general election also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions regarding Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server while the ten@@ ure was to continue as a foreign minister , most Democratic voters felt happy with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the E @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed her opinion .
they are rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voting rights does not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights no longer see tr@@ ump than non @-@ honest and not trusted .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump do not receive good grades with guidance .
out of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut them best with hon@@ esty .
a majority is rather honest , rather than hon@@ estly , but like Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the sampling rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a national inquiry about Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times and behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the elec@@ torate &apos;s support are in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large number . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted over the Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , about 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flew from 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son comes well with demo@@ graphic groups and over@@ takes tr@@ ump at Republican voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Ka@@ herself , is down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest point , namely from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio take a 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son clim@@ bs into the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support at the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also demonstrated tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
in a glance at one of the last week Rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side@@ walks for the former neuro@@ surgeon who himself after Car@@ son decided to question the tr@@ um@@ ps of faith in question .

five members of the Brotherhood help with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new territory
almost two years after a student has passed while a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ lam@@ s are handed over five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual marking in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to access a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waiting an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms of goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said police records Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide and exposed the welfare of the Brotherhood in general about the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tico Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with dum@@ my power injuries on head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the black@@ ness of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attor@@ ney , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fra@@ der@@ ships and their members have to be held to account and this step by authorities are very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe encouraged an indictment for murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of sus@@ pic@@ ion attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to make the involved individuals responsible but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned , so we will also pull this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their belonging to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
one interest rate is coming , and the hou@@ se is advised to get into a double , ren@@ ding for bonds , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will be .
in particular , the story for the economy only offers low guidance for the course .
a recession came within 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on lifting the interest rates is often , although not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding .
hence , representatives of the US central bank acc@@ entu@@ ates that investors should not concentrate on what it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
by the end , market participants could determine that the entire excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some of a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief economist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no implic@@ ations .
here is an historic trends based look , how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate options may make things for a while .
once the increase begins , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to be di@@ ced from 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which perhaps again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is generally up@@ trend in the upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate rise , almost flat over the last six days , with an average return in the past six years , with an average return on Bob D@@ oll , Chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank told that the impact on stocks tend to occur later in the Incre@@ ase cycle and the return is starting to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates enhance it often .
in the current case , F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that didn &apos;t existed before and accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when interest rate is raised .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent of advertising was used by 118 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will rise and expect to expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest rate cuts in such frag@@ ile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question as if this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade constitutes a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study all the increase of increases by 1950 to the day in a super cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ation during the GDP and rec@@ alled low @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights very quickly after the outbreak of recovery in the shadows . &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months so far .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market is under@@ going a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect when bonds is faster than shares when sharing their strategic course .
when bonds , ren@@ ders appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase in drop in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase life , the loan portfolio fell immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
strateg@@ ists expect Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise will lead to the interest rate , that returns to shorter and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly @-@ interest income often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re still cau@@ tious to expect higher income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ tical in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , Jones know that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has been adjusted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
low @-@ term interest rates are increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , ten@@ sion@@ ing have expanded and the vol@@ atility became increased - all the market characteristics if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the large and all , companies that wrap the larger part of their business activity in the USA will profit , when interest rates are increasing , and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , as an asc@@ ending dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively , three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs in one report to the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet expectations have been sur@@ passed on average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital accounts as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
businesses with a high share of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising profits .
spar@@ se could see profits through higher yields , even though experts are in different opinion , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ atives critici@@ zed the transmitter , because of its &quot; emp@@ t@@ ness &quot;
it has argued that he is not to discrimin@@ ate with commercial ri@@ vals .
he also reli@@ ed on the BBC Music Awards and said they only have The Br@@ its im@@ itated
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice of The Voice on and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leader of the committee and increased new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC bos@@ ses that the public radio stations &quot; ob@@ um@@ me &quot; and increasingly , more of its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn up to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples in which you actually only do that which is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 : I will not learn classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music music that truly is un@@ parall@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and order new works , I &apos;m also really important for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er will be worked to engage with the audience when it did it in the past because the British dis@@ covers less of classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of BBC production during the hearing in the Committee on Culture , Media and Sport , under fire , bringing the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice of the BBC , the musical talent show of the BBC , purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - The Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George made a judge - &quot; was produced on a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our company &apos;s stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it took the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from the Voice of The Voice in the future or to execute the funds for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew slower in August at the slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for it .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
the last month , it was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in the year 2000 .
online sales increased 3 years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed the issues in November
the virtual shopping m@@ om@@ t for over a decade , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into a ghost town .
however , experts say that there are indications that the online revenues stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are reports that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look back to growth rates for the previous years and to go back in 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales were reinforced by three years ago as a buyer , started acting with its mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and could do people in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from the Americas , is quoted as a reason for its final revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take place their shopping in this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some tra@@ ders have been over@@ thrown .
experts believe that Black Friday who could with@@ stand the buyer for bar@@ gains because buyers might stop doing purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that a total of £ 5 spending is spending a little more than £ 1 online .
some products like TV and washing machines will now be carried out more than one @-@ third of the purchases on the web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man buys clothing and shoes online instead of chains in the inner city chains .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British adop@@ ts increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe rise the rise behind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are designed for tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales leaders will close
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
it will say that Britain will roll their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified eastern European craftsmen that perform works in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you often belong to a minority .
for Britain increasingly employ professionals to carry home jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree stum@@ bling chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to deep prices , is now ob@@ sol@@ ete .
so King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and closing 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men weigh the guys .
she said it was necessary to set out the growing demo@@ graphic trends , showing more female single @-@ households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this more into an equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
in general , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also has its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - a variety of diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for the board of directors .
King@@ Fis@@ her returned a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group ow@@ es the cost of closing of the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
a@@ I / DO@@ B Func@@ tion@@ aries for Un@@ faithful Jud@@ gement
at the Federal Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials from the Austrian volleyball player , I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for un@@ faith@@ fulness and ev@@ asion .
the accused did not confess .
one of them was also charged with authority .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants used in the years 2006 to 2011 that they were allowed to disp@@ ose them in their functions for private purposes .
he dis@@ covers the damage with about 400,000 Euro .
the sports officials are also charged with finance routes .
this kind was due to the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ fe@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , out of this law .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
according to the accus@@ ation , the defence council that no time had a possession of asset manager at any time .
the sports officials would have been mis@@ calculated and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money , came out of the debt - the liabilities were about 600@@ ,000 euros in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we guide the club further or un@@ lock it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread manager of financial am@@ bition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , put our life insurance in the bank , &quot; he said in cash .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts may not be made .
in addition , to appropriate financial aid the compensation of the allow@@ ance charges had been decre@@ asing until 1991 .
as a result , I paid a part of the expenses only years later , namely from 2003 when an increase was on the account , paid out .
therefore the l@@ ump @-@ switch and non @-@ detailed bookings are explained , the former ob@@ servers explained the processes .
the accounts and books managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association did not have been published in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in detail for financial affairs , is important to have been the debt of debt , the answer .
when , in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the United States , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association account .
that had been , they declared the accused .
the Bank account , on the names of the second def@@ endants , was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent did not know an answer for a long time .
then he thought , he believed that this was the best thing for the association .
if something happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosecutor declared in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary was justified .
this transfers was re @-@ form@@ ulated as &quot; dam@@ aging rec@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;
why confirmation agreement ? , judge judge and At@@ tor@@ ney know .
the first accused , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never produced a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , he said the function@@ ary , he never lost a cent salary which he expects only o@@ dom@@ ic@@ ul@@ ties and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets , he charged 1.000 Euro a month &apos;s association , but the actual expenditure had been much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not present the def@@ endants .
these are according to an operating trial , in which everything was judged correctly , not having been kept properly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ite also included the second def@@ endants .
all per@@ missions are in cash , in addition , he has to leave from his residential community on the bank to Blei@@ burg . he said in his testimony .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the witness of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ bank@@ note
the world ob@@ serves if the US @-@ bank@@ note is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists , interviewed by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this now , now believes the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rate will remain at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is an historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has been at NULL since F@@ ed Inter@@ est .
&quot; for the first time , we approached a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero zone and starts a process of norm@@ alising the interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore a little cau@@ tious outlook on global relationships .
it warned the markets to establish itself on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are against such a step well .
the decision was scheduled to be released at 20.00 hrs on Thursday .
sc@@ orer at the Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleague and killed him - Sh@@ annon Lamb said a note to say that he was &quot; tired &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it illegal , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot at one another , and someone killed .
later , Lamb said the staff of emergency call that police must send c@@ ops to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably ex@@ tri@@ ght . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the an@@ is@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police have entered the scene they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who loved me . &quot;
on the writing of the note stood more than 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen trained him .
vice President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which lamb allegedly believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday gave &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was told by Shawn O &apos;s ste@@ en that she said she was about seven years old than a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced about 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s have had a daughter whose 19 is , and it was &quot; destroyed &quot; at the bottom . &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb called herself at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen climbed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later , later , lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed themselves with a shot .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans to establish a large group of consolidated .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the company will cost around 1,000 executives around the world to work in the workplace .
with the pilot plant , there is in@@ justice in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds her business structure around and evalu@@ ates the cheaper eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and cost syn@@ ergi@@ es . the airline divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , in the future , there is no longer a board for passenger transportation .
the low cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
managing team around Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the company Karl Ulrich pra@@ ises for eu@@ ros@@ ings in the future .
the re@@ launch under@@ scores the importance of eu@@ ros@@ ings to join the group in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines changed under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , which represents a quarter of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations were to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ cur@@ ated strike on this Thursday .
this divided the union alliance .
theme of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
cockpit was supposed to come with a predicted record result &quot; in a year with a predicted record result . &quot;
the conflict between union and Air@@ line has led to various strikes during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the pilots of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for double Fra@@ ktur
the Champions League defeat of Manchester were fought with the Champions League defeat of Manchester during the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while wearing foreign counsel and wines , Louis van Ga@@ al dis@@ closed the hope for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno on the 15th minute after the 20 year old sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg band and is located in the hospital . &quot;
it will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then in Manchester had surgery .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United that &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the cabin cabin .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double bed , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ m .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican guy .
van Ga@@ al thought that the Italian arbit@@ er had mist@@ aken .
they can judge for themselves , if I say a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe what I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this regard , Manchester United proves the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of the PS@@ V
the UK defence attor@@ ney has an additional incen@@ tive for the European Championship to recover until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to harm an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his purpose to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was on the way in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital , after a f@@ oul@@ ume of Chris Sm@@ aller .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos; one thing that all parents learn to be soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost instantly .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite child@@ rens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , released in 1971 , decided to label Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company super camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it &apos;s always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything is nice and good except that the following paragraph that Cameron describes the action of the book instead , to restore a summary of the 2012 movie version , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , whose desire to see a real tree , reads , &quot; whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 and died completely unknown .
as if that was not susp@@ icious enough : the text led by Cameron reads , partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams .
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ ben@@ oted boy , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ailing , thro@@ po@@ ck@@ ling self @-@ bears , &quot; which is said in the name of the trees , &quot; will be rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times after a child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker says the text was probably coming from the Cam@@ er@@ ons election office .
the super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but had no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
pushing for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you chose the cad@@ res to see the England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test runs will not be on my card .
I wouldn &apos;t finish off an out@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good Sp@@ in players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the association spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this related message : Adam Ly@@ th exp@@ oses from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , to me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are focused on results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said that - players are their own best choice .
long ago , people had extended the barrel of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully sm@@ ashed another runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not offer such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man gets to set up his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton has got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that was to rise was that England first sat in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in high shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a striking man I switch highly .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must pay at least the same chances as those in front of him , but this depends , of course , on the team list in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , mos@@ ques , along with Cook , put in order to bring an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler , and I got four Qu@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t show anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ lows could not strike there , and this left @-@ h@@ anders has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may perhaps do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is there a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he re@@ joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately managed about three hundred men immediately , and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the K@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 by the ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that raises her hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever ad@@ ditions at the coaching station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ et , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor to the test games could be a master@@ mind .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est not@@ ion of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , as it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be re@@ fresh in the dressing chamber , even if the messages are in line with the previously be@@ ad@@ ds .
Coll@@ age &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the one @-@ day , R@@ oot received a similar break towards Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain out of the EU ) might gain a claim that the economy will reach a flood control until 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep Britain in the EU will fall deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or TU@@ C who was heavily torn to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at who said some member states , so deeply rejected in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with divided circumstances and dis@@ rup@@ ting contracts that usually do not wish to get satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided upon its annual meeting that it doesn &apos;t like it , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance will climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they would win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to demand outside the Great Britain within the EU - &quot; L@@ ass gets us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets himself see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials come across some capit@@ als to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
German cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel has a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , just as it looks for the over@@ ly long ex@@ h@@ ations like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also an ob@@ sc@@ ant power .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break up a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better for it , Scotland &apos;s outlet from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may not plan more helpful notes , particularly in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won none of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of heads @-@ ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , but were not supported by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opport@@ un@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ad @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ref@@ ly , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
for this purpose , the med@@ ley of the med@@ ley @-@ for@@ ged ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ y foreigners and the p@@ seudo @-@ in@@ mates , who have most of our large newspapers , belonged to the med@@ ley .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noted that when you are sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , they were better distributed to ban@@ anas , instead of allowing for lunch and dinner .
in fact , militia was more than Bl@@ air himself , when Bl@@ air turned the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press doesn &apos;t reject it too .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly liqu@@ or on Monday in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to die for me - appears in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cott Mur@@ k@@ ott of the 80 @-@ s years , an error at that time and today .
it may take place but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I get it kind of kind - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ p traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ble trend and wil@@ der followers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can probably say Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; on the radio and TV this week , when the sc@@ out had fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was the designation of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a scra@@ m@@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father beha@@ ved on television to loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without having to go far and to lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , something J@@ C told his fellow trav@@ ellers and par@@ liament@@ arians after all reports on Monday night .
whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to conv@@ ey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV all over the clock , and above all in the stru@@ del of soci@@ etal media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron without a free ticket to Europe who allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ings for a comprehen@@ sibility , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns essential pl@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite @-@ school@@ ing economy , their anti @-@ capitalist history - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents who is a central fun@@ nel of dog@@ matic stri@@ kers .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest is convinced that J@@ C will not start the campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political Capital , they also have susp@@ icious elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government to power when I was re@@ minded on Monday by the launch of the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts &quot; critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England on E @-@ cigarettes
statements of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the resi@@ li@@ bility of the data and sent to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate foundation , &quot; based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expec@@ tation is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed audit of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people , which were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .

he also signed the references from BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to obtain funding from a e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to add to them .
the reasons for the selection of the Gre@@ mi@@ um &apos;s selection are not provided , but includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he participated too .
the Research Work of the Group &quot; suggests that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the cause of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee und Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers dies on his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison is small , but that we continued to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the explic@@ it obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what evidence occupies and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die yearly in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system £ two billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ l@@ ders a former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop working programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they will be public broad@@ caster programs which could probably be seen from a smaller crowd , in hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their rival and radio stations such as BB@@ C4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the BBC director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success at the BBC in contact with the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sending out who were clearly shown clearly from un@@ subsidi@@ zed Riv@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I kept in the middle or in the long term for a good idea , one should not make its production at least for programs that others won &apos;t work or place .
they send The Voice in a first time window , because they want to achieve as wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both original productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I stri@@ ve to see how this shall be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this was going to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for the series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will re@@ prove what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows as East@@ l@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ IC programs must walk to BB@@ C4 where they can &apos;t measure up their tasks , and they can argue if they have created on their apparent mission as a rect@@ angle of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , naturally , we have created all of this ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
commenting on the radio fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions who can get the best value .
of course , think all of us think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the $ 150 , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC should check out their stimul@@ us mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful on television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ caster alli@@ ances go down to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ os@@ genetic Product &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have been bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled from breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have a sound impul@@ ses , which have a high frequencies belonging to the human hearing , are ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the pul@@ ses can work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write the brain activity with light
the researchers have said the worms showed the power of a new procedure known as Son@@ os@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ de@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace the ra@@ ging brain les@@ ulation , a invasive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain &apos;s brain treatment for the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms are not respon@@ ding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ bul@@ lah noticed that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasound roll@@ ers , which penet@@ rate into the worms .
the intensi@@ fied ultrasound sensors affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves carry the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such a journal Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Cal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their m@@ on@@ ons are worn by TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when replacing ultrasound to the different creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to worms where they turn on the changed m@@ on@@ ons .
the process has simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool which enables scientists to interv@@ ene and activate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ de@@ ani said that Son@@ os@@ genetically could have some benefits compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which must have sent down an optical fiber to the desired spot in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic for@@ ging tissue can hin@@ dered , and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily strain the neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , then added .

8 Gold rules for living in student residence
11 years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the attracted sm@@ iles of those who I have stum@@ bled - and on numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most , what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the native of student residence is ranging from easy to sc@@ ary up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people have come from where you come from , if and where you have taken your Sabbath year , and why you have said frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate them , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it uses the conversation and helps you to find out people you like in contrast to those with whom you do not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were burned in fire and these extingu@@ ishers would have .
let people leave people .
people are often converted into drinks @-@ reception , film @-@ night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
intro@@ vert a rough handling at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence are a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ culture , which can lead to life and soci@@ ally and to life long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continued , but you have to go away to get back the energy that I &apos;ve consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
speaking of ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce himself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked to you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats are a good way to close friends .
their room@@ mates feel committed to enter@@ tain themselves , and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise in the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly missing cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat can lead to people sleeping , if you drop anchor .
food to steal , is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the c@@ laws of chicken is an theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check out with the milk owner .
chances are good they say to themselves , even if they cook in inside .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mates , who added a washing liquid to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being an ongoing person , but that you belong in the true sense of a pro@@ ver@@ b to men who are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , if it makes them something off , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had an exam in the morning .
they responded even listening to music with some more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 , her neighbours gave them two hours later , before she left her own music , shut their door shut , and set off for her three hour test .
would it not romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
in reverse , it would be not dist@@ ressing , if you have a fellow country@@ woman holding her future sp@@ ouses to go back to them and then see each day and perhaps see how they all have shared their shared family ?
of course , your heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co@@ habit@@ ant is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least to talk a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine than it seems .
a good quest is fun , but it only takes some moments , until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
we can inform you by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never cut any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door and place its keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but don &apos;t sha@@ king their owners at the ceiling no longer than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , all parties , Ger@@ ing@@ held
the real estate business winner Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is built in the central @-@ style corner houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need shelter , but also the mother &apos;s alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still be able to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands refugees are pushing onto the property market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly the living room can be created quickly : it builds inside a town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the property market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
given the refugee stro@@ ma , we also need a sufficient living room in the next decades .
a very ban@@ quet , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
this is different if people blocks people in residential comple@@ xes .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then , the houses can be converted lightly according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
gas : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is valued at 184 000 Euro , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
six months took the building .
that is reasonable .
do construction @-@ rules make their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I &apos;ve just pulled the project correctly .
especially complex makes it always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ scra@@ p special construction and the placement arrangement .
cre@@ epy .
the building is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is the space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the citizens react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were some people accused me of creating luxury cars for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but does not tigh@@ tened the competi@@ tor to affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany last five years , but were constructed in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need a living room .
not only refugees , but also the alone inherited mother or less den@@ ser all alone .
I show how one can still build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , since they get an error message , in the process that the &quot; software update is mis@@ ro@@ uted . &quot;
to get around the problem , users recommended to either wait until the rush will go back or try to update on iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create a place - but Apple has made it more likely to do that by tigh@@ tening the updates , and so it will be easier to install apps and re @-@ install apps once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charging during up@@ dating or is located close to a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple makes it possible that the update will be continued , as the phone may sh@@ uts down half way , and this could lead to a breakdown of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ler@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ heim Palace have joined together under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new reference point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
besides deliber@@ ations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social ar@@ son pul@@ ls it down from the hill into the city center .
more exactly in the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district facility was opened there .
here , directly beside the shopping market , we receive from immediate sen@@ iors and advice information on questions such as health insurance , health insurance and nursing services .
for years , we have concluded with our out@@ patient care service , that often , nursing homes may be left alone .
there are many questions .
&quot; neither rarely many of the members of the insur@@ ers are not accepted , because the complexity of insurance policy is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new household income in J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is responsible as the chief executive officer Al@@ ten@@ Aid and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; .
besides the consultations , the new district offices also provides prevention , health and wellness .
for this reason , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are in the ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city center see both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
because this make a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure into the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future im@@ essential .
moreover , for example , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) is also devoted to the inauguration ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ler@@ büro also devoted itself to the club ambi@@ ance of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite for a regular so@@ vi@@ ed funeral service . &quot;
in doing so , the Social Foundation is a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as well as good in their familiar surroundings .

the sacrifice suffered a no@@ stri@@ de at this time , ble@@ eds strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends ab@@ hor@@ red and talked to the bats , he first suffered from his victims .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove it several times over there .
when you saw the vehicle no longer , the last one went ahead of the building to smoke a cigarette .
he was attacked again from the ra@@ cket and another male person .
using the aid of a punch @-@ up one was tested on the face and the upper th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller is responsible for practice and investing € 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows .
this is also delighted to host Bernd Bor@@ mann &apos;s prof@@ ess@@ orial mayor , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs , Wil@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places on the country , doctors and As@@ endorf are missing . there , Dr. Frank Müller becomes the practice of Fel@@ sen@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows retired , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich goes into his successor for the next few months with a half spot .
after a building phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , up until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 in the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance , when the cliff is known in front of years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ g@@ l , who currently completed their medical examination in the Bavarian hospital and will also enter into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows and laughs .
&quot; when it happened , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller @-@ liked the idea of running its own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so one agreed , the Mü@@ llers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical office in Hannover , followed by stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel .
he is currently active as a veter@@ in@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was ordered as a senior in@@ arian in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is actively involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Bo@@ er works as a specialist , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ ne@@ ists , want to settle in hou@@ s@@ aries .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ g@@ ond@@ l .
after the conversion , the spaces will look much more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term power and power rating EK@@ GS and require a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euro is provided by Mü@@ llers as part of a project program ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes the Lord Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients are born according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ g@@ l every quarter in practice rim , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is still another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of practical trials by Frank Müller : the pharmacy is located according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone too .
those who visited Mü@@ llers are , by the way , particularly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power from the rocks .
with their depar@@ ting departure in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medical practices have been prac@@ tised for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen buys a gr@@ in .
a little sad@@ ness feel it already after the long time .
&quot; but we live well in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients certainly still often , &quot; says Intern@@ ships .
her husband is expanding &quot; : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter land . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pressed myself against gardening , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels to G@@ ud@@ dle .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are asc@@ ended at our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants a request for asylum that can &quot; naturally &quot; could .
the care and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that there needs a clear signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we will not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
a controlled approach needs .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had told him that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany and chose cor@@ rid@@ ors to the refugees under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not appear yet .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be monitoring the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outside of the Schengen Area .
as the Minister empha@@ sized , Sloven@@ ians will not intend to label its borders for refugees .
&quot; every EU member must fill up its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to travel in eastern Croatian at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police have taken it to the near corn fields .
according to local media , ever since , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there has been a permanent police vehicle with new refugees .
it also takes care of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the years ahead , his country with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo was transferred to the Maced@@ onian border , which had previously brought to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , backed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Serbian government denied it , however , that it would be that people need to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was .
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive at the border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses were expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road through Serbia all night , about 500 km away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary had been made , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
it is now possible to have already been prec@@ eded by ob@@ serving the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little more to the west coast .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for cross @-@ border security &quot;
Croatian interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared adequate plans for potential explo@@ sions for the case of a strong supply by refugees .
details did he not indicate , but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
it controls ri@@ gor@@ ous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been amongst the EU since 2007 , and since then , the EU partner has consistently been a good witness , which concerns the standard of the border controls .
Serbian border is still stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n region around 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they would have spent the past night at the Border Cross@@ ing Hor@@ embar@@ k , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two bor@@ gos and back@@ i por@@ ters remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees w@@ ishing to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister for Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was trying to calm on Wednesday early on a local light . he kept the debates about Alternative rou@@ gh@@ s of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not take care of very high number of refugees .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers to migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian Refu@@ gee Agency began to distribute travel cards to land maps , on which alternative routes are classified by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian border .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine @-@ spatial areas was sent to the border region .

therefore , this public transport movement is good for the 20 year olds .
that not everyone to tell the tables public , however , was understand@@ able , eventually , it was a very personal thing .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the final quarter , and the supply of supply provisions for a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight service and higher cost in its transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seas@@ on@@ ers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to convert 50,000 season workers for the holiday season .
this share fell by over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces to Ear@@ n a $ 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next month , 20 cents less than in the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , on average 4.9 percent , and to be effective on 4th January and despite increased supplements for soil transfers of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless anticipated that the result was due to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and for growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid earnings , &quot; if one has we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , consider . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations employment were announced a day later than the rival UPS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , about the same number as last year .
in the third quarter ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million was sold , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ a share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share which analysts predi@@ ct 12 of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; six of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked was 12.@@ 23 billion $ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex has set up a decline in international priority shipment in recent years , which have stagn@@ ate sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales of business transport rose by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher rates for larger packages and insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , whereas the result was for higher labor costs in the freight business .
in Pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks collapsed by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story sitting rooms is located a mur@@ al picture of the United States .
the card is a reminder of the fact that the chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and his colleagues should implement the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time contract from the Congress : to maxim@@ ise U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an uns@@ ri@@ pen@@ ultimate third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented growth rate by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy indicate that it is solid growing , the recent turbul@@ ence might be anxi@@ ous to strengthen the global financial markets in order to rein@@ force the bond of interest to the federal government - and be it only about one quarter of the percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they have seen , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Director at the Mak@@ ef@@ el Fo@@ under Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate would not increase , increased uncertainty around the global market is enough jus@@ tification , continued &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by itself to the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists , which were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
financial markets however wait a wait for the F@@ ed to display a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance at an increase .
this points to a decline in the equity market if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , it is because the strateg@@ ists turn down the blow by claiming that an additional increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average increased 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy stays the set during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they didn &apos;t get in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because it would effect the uncertainty when the F@@ ed is to er@@ adic@@ ate .
even before one month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in the early summer that it was necessary in this year despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to raise an increase in the set .
although employment was slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed has to be regarded as full @-@ employment .
wage improvements have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation remained constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can tackle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets were all over the world at the end of the month , after China &apos;s currency dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average increased by more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , that a slow@@ ing in the Chinese economy would seem to imp@@ ose global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , and the Dow has now passed by nearly 10 % under the h@@ ype of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives influence the market turbul@@ ence the complex calculation , when one should increase interest .
&quot; if the events were not occurred on the financial markets and the messages about the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent few weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US @-@ bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is neither the main concern of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the former Leit@@ ronic Ben p . Bern@@ an@@ ke of the year 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; close their monetary expansion &quot; caused a con@@ fu@@ sions around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor from the F@@ ed representatives but are not only advised to monitor developments at other locations , but also control with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently not coinci@@ des with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee that sets up for an interest rate , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lad@@ ders by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited re@@ perc@@ ussions for the growth in the United States &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives went on these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability at the first place in 2008 , such as Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the most recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to fall into the situation where they fear for interest , because the markets became more exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that changes , I do not think that it should take time .

Brazilian Society for Brazilian Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian designer SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy them in sho@@ cking way women as important as important nutrition during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only dietary adaptation that mothers should take .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was actually affected by the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Gym
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ a@@ waited turn@@ around building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports facility will step forward step by step : in the youngest municipal elections , the building application was fl@@ aked out without great discussions .
previously , the panel had , among other things , a motion for a &quot; resp@@ ec@@ tive &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; liberation &quot; of the current development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was to provide permission for a special form on the roof construction .
accordingly a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ rich First and umbrella super@@ nat@@ ures &quot; are to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the planned use of the roof area for solar power systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , we get together a wonderful south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger , who was sitting in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn again around the roof that was pre@@ formed for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan , which should lie below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council to more restric@@ tive towards liber@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is not a recur@@ ring project at the turn@@ around project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a community project in the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs .
grants are expected from school and latitude .
in the next step of procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the coun@@ cill@@ or for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the hospital in the district of the district , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white confirmed .
however , a decision shall meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans should be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees were employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority stay with fishermen and the further existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the cow@@ or@@ kers , who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the resignation from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
with the question of who should enter the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game which has been prepared to take the lead on 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the internal station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
similarly , for the next two years Fischer with his team when the supervisory board should lead to meet both homes until the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ship , which has yet to be over 35 beds , has to be closed permanently , after almost 140 years .
so far , the county had planned this in 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
survey@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , came out to meet what the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in future .
&quot; I &apos;ll close it up . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say , there are several consider@@ ations .
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry there , there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better cannot happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to assume the post of medical directors .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been closed again in the last decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth @-@ help .
the hand@@ le@@ ver of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Li@@ ons are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) when the mining was required .
in Wuppertal , the league player in the Bundesliga is the clear favourite , but there is no surprise to the surprise .
in the last season , the pool moved with B@@ HC a painful defeat and there have been something to change there .

the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning , after the evening after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not been taken home .
in search of young women , investig@@ ators first beat the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .

refugees need accommodations : the study warns of typ@@ ologies
the situation in the German residential resort is more pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ed .
more refugees are also looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution events in the German residential property market has long since begun .
with the coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people push for a market being over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens to attract the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
for this result , a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing &quot; contract .
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
there@@ with , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , to live for asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency accommodation .
many stum@@ ble on the home market and they lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers died .
however , the negative development of the property market is not only rising to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant predi@@ ctions in the investment policy of the last years .
Germany sh@@ ines a home deficit before , which will become bigger by year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther is missing in the Ball@@ room areas , compl@@ ains by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals lived in large cities listed in flat @-@ room rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ will@@ ingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; for the inf@@ au@@ te on the housing market .
the number of square metres per capita has fallen back in the big cities over the past years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incen@@ tives are to boost social homes again .
thus , on the real property tax , the property tax would be disp@@ le@@ ased and the property tax for funded housing will be suspended .
accordingly , according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ adjustment possibilities are needed .
the funding programme for refugee families from Kf@@ W joined forces in towns and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start was posted on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the roughly 300 million euros provided .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free joints : Croatia and Slovenia address Cor@@ ridor
in Hungary , practically no coming is coming , there will always attract more refugees to the streets of Croatia .
Zagreb announces that travel through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous , however .
Croatia is meeting with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slov@@ ene interior minister and when necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RTL .
on the day before , Hungary was shut down its border for refugees .
new laws , coming into force on the same day , deci@@ de@@ dly superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to aband@@ on the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; they can pass through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police fired the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most from the media reports have reportedly been reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you arrived both by bus and taxi in the Serbian town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees do not return to Gren@@ zz@@ le@@ une .
for this , the border crossing further dangers : there are still sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war over the 1990s .
mine @-@ spatial plans to now establish a safe passage .
after closing the border , however , barely any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police attracted 3@@ 66 registered people .
briefly before the door on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law not@@ ches the over@@ coming and damage the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were led in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
he pre@@ fers to pre@@ supp@@ le sentences of up to five years and the deportation of the country .
according to data from the immigration authority on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum orders received , from which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees forced .
practically , nobody has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
in Hungarian reflection , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
the &quot; Tran@@ sat@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to am@@ end this .
they collected the garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the streets in the past weeks .
the lat@@ tice were broken down and one of the admission camp in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the aim of this upgrade .
Austria lo@@ oses only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants turns into government , but still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train transportation from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
may@@ ors &quot; Le@@ aks &quot; over the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the dying , ten people with travel off@@ s stood at the entrance of the tent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly limited on Sunday because of refugee stro@@ king with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein conclusion , &quot; City Council who immediately offered up his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars over the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
first of all , we have noticed the un@@ wanted guests , lunch and beverages .
we said the same way , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was certainly for us , &quot; City Council in O@@ Ö@@ N talks .
they were very grateful .
a man had not allowed himself to be handed over to a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; he is the City of City .
the stran@@ ded way@@ passengers increased on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE in a regional direction of Pass@@ au , by the announcement that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany after the short term , but still to try over the border .
but the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in general .
the bridge firm association with the Bavarian neighbors held on Sunday , closed in the day before a two @-@ bri@@ d@@ ling sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
telling the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends more Z@@ ig@@ ans to us , a logical result of one of the sacred politics :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke refugee camp immediately , our Federal Chancellor att@@ ends its intention and publicly put relations to the position of Hungarian government into the vi@@ st@@ int of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ l of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are faced in the boundary areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; Blessed Land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge , given the continuing refugee flow and the close w@@ inters to produce decent conditions for protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be one more major - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter festivals
Konrad has handed over all his hands to the refugee .
Christian Konrad is it used that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker &quot; to put tor@@ o@@ sts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first admission center in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was delivered without a great vort@@ ex , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Interior Ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are supposed to prepare countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the sovereign debt .
they would have promised to achieve this , even for upcoming refugees to compete .
in Ober@@ öster@@ reich it runs fine , &quot; says Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory wins Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clari@@ fied , as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ators are also given to the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , you hopes to be empty in hotels in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in not@@ e@@ time , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ or has to have a certain height of the per@@ pen@@ holder or the size of finishing .
for the short term &quot; emergency standards &quot; had to be applied .
unlike the Ministry of Interior Ministry that he was successful , Konrad is with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , which is not un@@ truth in the face of un@@ truth .
persu@@ asion is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er have no cost of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own qu@@ ino@@ er@@ search has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to open a container at the st@@ eph@@ enth@@ system as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz to demand a better distribution
no opening of urban Spor@@ th@@ os and other buildings such as hin@@ ts @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the time since the subject could be implemented without these measures , says President Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
further locations should be tested on their capability for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
cri@@ tique sets out by the Ministry of Finance in the division of the refugees within the federal state .
also other districts need to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits shall not be gr@@ ated &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Bu@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , en@@ vi@@ ed further progress in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German limits will not be gr@@ ated .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic shall continue to be continued .
however , there is now the related border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the protection @-@ seek@@ ers were brought to Germany by regular moves .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ag@@ inger had once more increased solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria also enters its borders to its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from entering the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production facilities , the listed IT Group is owned by S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 sq m ) is to be rented on young , innovative companies from the technology field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , the smart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in startup companies of the New Shi@@ pyard and later , as well as to ac@@ qui@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which low @-@ estate promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , 1.7 million euros were invested in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Centre , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ Safety Center .
some 30 percent of the 2700 square metres of the properties available in the building have already been rented out , for another 40 percent give it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ tor opened second business in the Arctic
the new shop guarantees Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to go a dog .
this project had to rank up the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ holding of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , it has now got an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop over the business it sells bags , bags , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , now everything is about ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
greater hand@@ bags and accessories up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
this was rebuilt several weeks earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have considered a long time if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ ite says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crucial to the decision was , amongst others , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna can be sold from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold , were done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only in the big hall which sell these brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who gave up Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interests did get Bre@@ ite from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I share the most , if something developed , and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman with looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ tures can also be answered with the last safety .
maybe it &apos;s the reason that a beautiful bag is valued every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
this feature connects man@@ ders to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it is expressed by strange hos@@ tile , journalists , concerned or g@@ aps in international crisis policy , candidates for the US presidential office are ag@@ we@@ aving the campaign .
and he cuts well .
this is also registered in the oldest town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents come from the real estate of millions .
the New Yorker with the F@@ ood@@ eats is a term in the Win@@ di@@ dorf near the wine route .
man@@ ders in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related to -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election combat mode .
the C@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about p@@ umping .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their stad@@ ters style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sp@@ ades , to which alongside Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
the ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; ( 2014 ) also for Word - with the statement that he would certainly be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
indeed , there are respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a little la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - speak to high German : the investors , says she .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the late grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local restaurant in the USA .
the foundation of the property company were first property in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of business . her wish to return to the homeland , the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz was back then .
he had not admitted to Tr@@ ump because he was cancelled once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Contemporary History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film release .
the ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ es listed below .
the one had repeatedly nar@@ cot@@ ted over the Mexican immig@@ rant in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall in order to d@@ eter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the p@@ added , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Gran@@ ny was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in reti@@ ring , the Americans are rather dist@@ ancing ; &quot; he is always so thousand . &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension enti@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like man@@ ders K@@ all@@ stadt , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church organ , which came generally well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine so by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they seem better , if he won &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Creator Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also mature without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els Film , interviewed for the tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gers , even in the USA w@@ akes its interest .
the Bavarian village Ram@@ s@@ au in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
the vice @-@ president of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ z@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden national park on Wednesday .
in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain guides . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 people .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective zone .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the nine attempts of Nine , to acquire the loss of leadership in the Today show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son continue to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als but it has no large shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the German capital , Malcolm Turn@@ bull has managed to fall from Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows which belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to be playing for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als in comparison with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today announced a slight increase of ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the Sun@@ rise of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far , Sun@@ rise will have on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today in September .
this is the most interesting , what is happening every morning .
the winds of the change relate this morning more than the parliament !
Charles and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking !

the new drama on a recent father , which decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thomson could bear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hits easy The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe to watch 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour recorded by The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and over the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quota of the second evening by The Chase Australia will be able to ensure that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately end at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that doesn &apos;t make the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three voices are : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
uncover the secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently do not know who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the initiative of Sam Wood , was finally gro@@ unded in The Bachelor in Capital .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give away whether she is the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before starting out of three , you may have to acci@@ dentally put a reference to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted this in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense for hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was to receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they might have their answers to the enemy who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - for himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sens@@ ed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was pretty compatible with the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house stay last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already looking forward to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose who Wood should be , she was lepro@@ us .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten o &apos;clock on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as the Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
at the end of last year , Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams hoping to send en@@ quiries to its impressive open date at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a short@@ age , as the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League conver@@ ts in his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a P@@ unt return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the clo@@ ak@@ room after the game .
instead of putting his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the specialist coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ tern@@ ed catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was patented in a P@@ unt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ den and his massive Australian followers delighted to be for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field on the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL news career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ den compared the cut@@ ters with his original debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and keeps an Australian flag after the game , and post@@ ete it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .

the Free voters call for the high numbers of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and Leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn Conference in Grand @-@ Brabant after a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns &apos;s schools , when the many new students are not according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will have problems in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the daily survey of the free voters will be post@@ pon@@ ed until Friday in the underground Commun@@ e .
some of the main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free Pre @-@ voters .
&quot; of course the subject of asylum is called the c@@ laws , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria as it was during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we have to say about the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to cut the free voters as soon as possible .
thus , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts , responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum procedures , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the FW composer critic@@ ised that several provinces are not consistent ; &quot; we need nationwide standards of Germany &apos;s states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is p@@ liable , others won &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more convenient . &quot;
but the national policy is not falling into the table under the table .
a long term favourite remains on the agenda : the education policy .
as a result of the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot study &quot; Middle level plus &quot; and has been tested for an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ fication level of three to four years , then nine years back to SL@@ C .
but unfortunately , it does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ask choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to .
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired .

Infin@@ eon shares rose by a further 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax head .
according to a dealer , a positive report by the US investor &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared on the weekend .
therefore the investor presented the German chip@@ maker at the moment too little attention .
the investments in advanced waf@@ er technologies and the focus should pay on the auto market .
autom@@ akers were required : even in the traditional weak summer months of August , more cars were set off than in the same period of the year , like the industry association AC@@ EA for the launch of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police officers shoot bul@@ lets in ne@@ prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd forming against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bomb .
Mr D@@ ha@@ fi said , the police have put tear gas and then shot in the air before turning to rubber @-@ fin .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why the most used rubber bul@@ lets were known to be able to kill them , but traditionally used as a less@@ er alternative , apparently a high fat@@ ality rate produced .
the dispute was the last week of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ ese Southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ei@@ i say that new provinces that would be formed in the proposed new constitution would reduce its political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were disp@@ osed of violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal has been controlled centrally .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature en@@ acted this week on certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
building area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ der Youth Centre next post is to be built again .

the preparations are currently running .
plan is to use the grounds for a mixture of commerce , trade , and business .
you wait for appropriate offers , it means part of the city .
which investor is coming , it is not clear .
no contracts were also concluded accordingly .
the city Em@@ den had purchased a part of the plot that is located at the ring road / corner Grand Street , already a few months ago and that it is still allowed to demol@@ ish the existing building .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table

the investor inaugur@@ ates publicly plans for the project .
some tra@@ ilers are wor@@ ris@@ ome - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .
for months of closed doors gl@@ assed , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house near Em@@ den on the table .
the interested , the mid @-@ sized em@@ aking company &quot; System construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ der .
originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , presented to the investors and the administration of intelligence , Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds left the system construction management board into the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t seen an answer to any questions , &quot; he said ahead of the Council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours right now .
these projects have been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros during the past months .
fierce reactions among Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ owners who came to the meeting , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , owner @-@ owner and member of the member of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z that out@@ stands every other prayer . &quot;
in addition , he fears as some other project critic that would strongly increase traffic by the planned size of the facility : &quot; all the bus charges have to come , so that the way says , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well @-@ hectare site of the former restaurant is , however , is still open .
there is no operating association yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds .
because it was still missing , the development plans are even variable .

Google launches a double campaign targeted campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a re@@ dou@@ bling donation campaign to bring 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that have to help thousands of refugees that have rolled out the European nations , as they flee from war torn and pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donations of donations in his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul , wrote when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey many dark railway and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global money collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were to double to 11 million $ .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easy redund@@ ant diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say whether it is easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery more than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death toll takes a long time to demonstrate something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ bs the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , O@@ bes@@ ity affects the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out by men who are mor@@ ally ob@@ ese with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data used to have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity - Mag@@ enb@@ b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those operated by this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 % to the end of the fifth year in this study .
below , the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were obtained approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure in 36 % , the diabetes disease was totally and 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group no less than two percent in comparison with diabetes were completely dissolved , in comparison with diabetes .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors noted .
the researchers also o@@ vers@@ aw the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels throughout the time .
in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic Control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , with Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also uses average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group decreased more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater responses in BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ load of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subject to obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is a soo@@ thing for people who are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians start to take weight seriously , once the patient is at its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated this genetic changes , which have connected their body with obesity and diabetes , an revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is currently under@@ taking attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and in@@ significant , meets the shame of her youth after years , and this fell in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder .
in addition to love , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ ett@@ ler readers , because he plays in Lang@@ a and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called on to stop violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put to the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis are ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to care for several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and said George Bush &apos;s actions after terrorist attack on September 11 , suggest@@ ing that the U.S. non@@ violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and that was called out of unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase by taking Hän@@ dem dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ins centers in the USA are reporting on a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , causing severe alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand @-@ infection products grew in children under 12 years using tox@@ ins , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in an emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children should drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do to im@@ press her friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers will drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant merely because of a budget experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed dis@@ infection with soft mouth@@ wash and mixed up a harder water .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ c@@ ated .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange showers which are very appealing to children .
ham@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sp@@ atter can already result in alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison gas centre in the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not have to@@ ying a key whis@@ key , but people release this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ Hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sprit@@ zer taken from the strawberry merchan@@ dis@@ ing agents in school , was brought to an emergency department .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , that is as a dr@@ unken as a drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris K@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor that she treated in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ Hai@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words , and was not able to go as she came into an emergency .
doctors guarded her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma when the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .

the lack of def@@ ending in Scottish football - red Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around things , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent drop@@ out of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who now lead to the top of the table with five points .
D@@ eila said , &quot; I had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need Celtic &apos;s support , because it makes the player better .
now working is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period of May to July 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people unemployed for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent , above the UK@@ s , was 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime the employment in Scotland went around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland in the course of the quarter fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the latest figures , the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in unemployment and a decline in unemployment .

why I wanted to be an execution in Oklahoma ,
somewhat later , apart from a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January via his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there often have more applications than places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery took place to decide who is elected .
the number of media sites in Oklahoma has been reduced to five .
who will be selected , who will observe it responsi@@ bly .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit with Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh many times when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving me up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
they admitted that it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international rep@@ orters to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I don &apos;t want to return here again to all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a favor of favor .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn away .
what you can get from me is what it means to die a man &apos;s death .
man after a mo@@ ist police ch@@ ases persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist was dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Perth to imp@@ ose the police , was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale police was called by C@@ anning V@@ ale on Tuesday to a domestic peace @-@ break @-@ incident at Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water , and said &apos; I come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ i Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform , so he turned to a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good pol@@ isher is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying him and threat@@ ens to end racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stock@@ ings in the past year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he reli@@ ed on the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of racing Victoria and claimed that she made a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Lon@@ ai for a racing day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said , Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ sample around Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had refra@@ ined himself 18 months because of his sp@@ ying and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look as high dro@@ oping grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say , and I did eat for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything is coming suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight , and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ raised main thing , and I want my owners think that I try my best to try .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I don &apos;t want to be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity Department had attempted to es@@ pion@@ ate his stable .
&quot; over eight months ago Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m asked if I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my stall , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
obviously , they seem that I am a che@@ ater .
if that is the case , they should certainly hold on their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to summar@@ ise me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , Vice President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , latest CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and still are today .
should this be said to me that it is personally ?
the RV@@ L has resi@@ ded itself and makes people outside exercising responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there , that I am it .
maybe they &apos;ll have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
during the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt tests performed at Li@@ dar@@ i , the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching shows that he said that he could throw &quot; his licence over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ protected master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a packing of mud or clay was applied to the horse de@@ ath@@ ons , which viol@@ ated against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees didn &apos;t mistake mud on the leg .
it could have been so night .
it could have been so yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it had been so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could also be faced with a three @-@ month discount for the treatment with the packing on the race day . a study of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy back fight ri@@ vals due to claims to ring tru@@ ffle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy , critic@@ ises the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the triumph@@ ant of the Storm @-@ Player &quot; Ring@@ ing &quot; will have allowed his team at night &apos;s qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly moving note to the Storm team after his crew had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland state not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that they only concentrate on their &quot; touch &quot; with the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident , as it means that they are worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; it appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ tone , when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent now has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team . he is therefore likely not to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how it appears again at this time of time again .
Bell@@ amy came under the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that Benn@@ ir@@ che St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons led the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a dam@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and which we look as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of gam@@ bl@@ ers .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so that they can play as these .
I fast@@ ener trust in order , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also insi@@ sted that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ ster scored a higher result as the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of bronze was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 . there were two further attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks do and not any d@@ amping sp@@ ies ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
if they mention , it means that we will meet again in a phase .
the Storm team kicked off this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begins next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail on drug candidates
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment is threatening for his su@@ p to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were shr@@ u@@ che@@ ated by Queensland , was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the Federal Police arrived 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that he had no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he travels to Serbia often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case he lied about police about his where@@ ab@@ ort .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to reach its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the edition of a $ 200,000 worth a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold it from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on damages , under the conditions that he returns his Australian and his Serbian passport , al@@ lied with the police daily and at an output block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ lie used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of decent pictures of children who were sent from another user .
the girl a@@ woke up later and found out that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confused announ@@ c@@ ements , and al@@ armed instantly her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analysed computer , who were found under the address and discovered the &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ches , &quot; the terms used for searching for untreated pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials , that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and he then gave &quot; a police officer to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the Prosecutor , E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson , told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ct that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the search was carried out on the computer by him , however , it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent to him the pictures and asking him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said , he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson adds : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and on weeping .
she then saw the one @-@ standing pictures on the phone and confron@@ ted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused was using computers and Play@@ station to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have irre@@ voc@@ able pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , and not to have appeared before the Court on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since they could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element in his way . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael ob@@ serves its verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings at other still outstanding cases .

slo@@ gan@@ s soft on small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away by the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many fun@@ n@@ uns come from fear of discovery and capture the people increasingly on smaller border crossing
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
along the border River Inn , there were more than 1,000 refugees crossing the rural districts Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot on bridges and dust @-@ fl@@ es to the German side .
there , they are taken from federal police in reception and rel@@ ayed to the registration .

and what is next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door @-@ fold in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .

additionally , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a range of over@@ working and new variants such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square @-@ square cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has announced an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary of the Te@@ gel , which was lodged in a small cell .
because of the violation of her human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the subject could even be hoped in money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in Karlsruhe , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , where he was lodged in a single cell with about five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separate .
after that , the man who is now re@@ located on the foot of his lawyer again was laid down in a larger cell .
his detention conditions prevail , due to the arrest of detention against the Berlin country .
but the constitutional complaint was lifted up the judgement of the Berlin Kammer@@ court and rejected the case for the re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber tribunal now decides about the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons for the periods should be decisive , only a few days of liability for the compensation came to be a compensation , it was issued .
otherwise , &quot; a wi@@ zard should fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now has to clear the amount of money damage .
the Con@@ stitu@@ tions have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they said only in April to give an in@@ mate to damages because he was naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human Un@@ worthy is a decision by 2011 also the multiple @-@ allocation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ age in November 2009 , also agreed on a decent accommodation .
the then ra@@ cket lasted three months , between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ son .
the Berlin pris@@ ons came in the headlines in recent weeks also because of the lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always shut down in 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness of aggressi@@ veness , however , due to the neglec@@ ted situation already arrived .
after the Justice Department on Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior schol@@ ars , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what happens to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following Overview .
according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of P@@ est@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings each year - and during the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living places is dramatic , mainly at affordable prices : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental apartment annually , and in order to apply these particularly advant@@ ageous apartments also in the area .
Federal Minister of State Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings have to be established and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , researchers and federal secretary agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research and vocational research , 55 percent of the poultry sector can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically being asked about their qualification in order to help them start . Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work was the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating the value of the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rations@@ ist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has been a political shift in Germany : from the ban on the ban to recognition of labour .
whereas previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers added up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ds to asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , too , - even because of the skilled workers - a majority of perspectives emphas@@ ise that refugees should be swi@@ fter from access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing Deutsch@@ emark .
so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
investigations show that jobs are most frequently communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
so the network of networks is therefore the king &apos;s way of work integration .
the Berlin School manager found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated to be 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only important to join the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja &apos;s schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of Kit@@ a , the management is distributed in various languages .
should the need of educ@@ ators strongly climb by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will attempt to raise the training capacity - for instance , by cutting more specialist schools .
in countries school@@ children are prepared according to tuition , subject to classes .
they are not always taught by being fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers , who have only one quali@@ fications in German as a second language .
to them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin School of School .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
basically , there is no federal asylum seek@@ ers or bud@@ get@@ ed study , but the only exception to Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ er Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude .
study free refugees could be reli@@ eved of the university &apos;s access .
because refugees with a permit or rest@@ ation do not get any services according to the asylum seek@@ er Act more when they begin to study .
the latter is basically no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G since they fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ore@@ g@@ eligible persons .
now , those who have been living in Germany have had to have lived for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ G &apos;s verdict , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but even these funding gap must be closed , &quot; Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Karlsruhe company .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ore@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is a key element of their identity .
the state should gradually include Islam as successive rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches demand to develop a new state @-@ religions ratio .
it would also be important to establish a Muslim charity , which professionally takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
obligations also belong to the rights .
thus , representatives of Islam must serve clear contact persons and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to ex@@ to@@ ise certain control possibilities .
to this end , the willingness to take away into action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , said on Thursday the worry , religious conflicts could also be entered via Germany .
those who wanted to push such conflicts in Germany have &quot; immediately their right to stay here , &quot; in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a topic of society .
this will also change the majority in the majority , including the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination directive for a decade and a general equality law .
but it was very slowly learning how the NSU @-@ murder show was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
the same chances for all : what migrants organisations and the stakeholders are already demanding for long , and for what the international agreements are to commit to non @-@ rac@@ ism , must remain reality in the coming years , if the country must remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of sup@@ plying medical care so far , said medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , to all applicants in the registration of healthcare tickets is required .
the services offered could be reck@@ oned later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly question@@ able unless many people meet with the limited performance catalog to look down the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors do mainly make the language barriers .
to date , the Berlin Scientific scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de documented migrants worse than other patients in Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , would have to be taken over by medical practices .
many refugees were also helped with more general practition@@ ers in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic glance .
in the refugee community there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the you@@ ths going to be an HIV clari@@ fication .
but in some cases , German doctors told them from their training but becomes clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery said .
&quot; the paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognise it . &quot; and in terms of lack of trouble , the refugees are actually bl@@ ur@@ red in sight .
the Syrians have developed a high @-@ development education system , some refugees and even doctors .
to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their quali@@ fications and re@@ trac@@ ts .
at least half of the refugees in Germany come to estimates of the bund@@ led sy@@ cho@@ ke therapy ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) mental ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are particularly vulnerable to refugee children .
a recently published study published by TU Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is involved in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , amongst others , suffers in flash signals with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , pom@@ p@@ ens , and fat@@ alities .
further symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , severe scre@@ ams and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , premature treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
thus far only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get an psycho@@ therapist .
indeed , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers may present a request for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
in addition , social workers were mostly subject to social workers or physicians , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , whether they are necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; passion &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst inter@@ vening the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age group in the spell of thri@@ lling ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sur@@ ing and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst into the circles on the bricks of was@@ ps to dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an instructor and juni@@ per .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current project design . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to inspire is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to get rid of people from their everyday scene and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; scar@@ city cocktail with world city fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus programme features talented artists from all over the world .
with the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family moves the audience with a joke and charm in their homes .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to get to the Cuban duo .
simplicity and flexibility - they identify themselves with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to capture some women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon salt the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger sensation and joint .
balance the wheel on a sphere ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
sli@@ mming is fascinating and troubled at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is entrusted with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ese &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes his position as well : &quot; does not feel good for our animals , it does not feel good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each matches .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , is read by the eyes of every wish .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to take it into the man@@ ege .
the highest commandment is good for the animals .
especially on their Zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mix of a shore @-@ stalli@@ on and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the family Pro@@ bst pride .
the two animals lived together 8 years in a walk and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
zeb@@ ra is not ready for the pic@@ ks , but it &apos;s the unique mascot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there will be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ injured , but the video of the case spread rapidly via the social media .
the opening of the parliamentary report was also clou@@ ded by statement by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with be@@ hr@@ u@@ ct .
last month they had blind@@ ed it and interrupted him in his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they warned against to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalist after Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of the Parliament that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and once they aband@@ on parliament , the parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the boss testified that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was held &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will likely build 25,000 to 30.000 work@@ places as part of the company &apos;s restructuring and savings efforts .
in this year HP will split into two listed companies and the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service @-@ performance business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure to the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person and Chief Executive , who is to conduct the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better set up than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion , and it will be focused on providing greater integrated technology solutions to companies , &quot; such as an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &quot; s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electric plants and have known their Palo Alto Garage , &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
hp also conver@@ ts a massive restructuring to master the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on conviction that strongly focused companies generating a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind which Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere has to stand
Wen@@ ger empha@@ sized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if its rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play Christmas again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old moment@@ um during the season .
&quot; this kind of violation of failure is not threatened by the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone which does not heal .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but such as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the adjacent danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a unpleasant patterns .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has performed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 dynamics in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight game hours since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were the most vulnerable to that .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the failure rate during the last season is over .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent time , a time that you must strengthen your body and win fight force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to be overcome .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will make a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb prior to the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta have been going to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance , and the players who need it to give a small bre@@ ather break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
although Arsenal are clear , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the greatest ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynamics is also unbe@@ aten in 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , followed by the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is opinion that Arsenal pulled the teaching from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far hope to lead the organisation to his first europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Festival : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , who has given us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now become more desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ murder rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aign today announced against Living Mis@@ er@@ ania ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim to ask the culture in question the men questioned help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ rage had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for making a friendship .
in the age of talking about social media , with its main focus on substance , the ability of response is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , doubles , even though the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values : money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and how a vide@@ og@@ ame and Billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated that money can not really buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction with the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler common hu@@ gs , moments at the soccer gu@@ esthouse in cozy sl@@ ackl@@ es and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to everyone , even though they often return to explore fully their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an associate of telephone officers , it told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening roll for people who feel reli@@ ant and cri@@ mp@@ ed to me , really showed me a difference how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
the old speech , &quot; I come on with it , &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term management mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective ou@@ tre@@ ach status via telephone to people in the eyes of despair may also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central friendship celebration with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
one never knows what difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episodes - for the # Friend@@ s@@ Festival
di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to break Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating his hits against Malmö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani left course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League this season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed them a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ring in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish Master , since it is not only interested in the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Race , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alist in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics had missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later joined the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he had started on a lively career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to contempl@@ ate our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that have to be perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry we didn &apos;t have any more or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic came back to the Paris team after having injury of three changes to the Paris team , which was holding 2 : 2 in their own place against Bordeaux , in the First League , but was designed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian airline stor@@ mer was referred to as the man to take over the next level in Europe when he took over the next month from Manchester United to find out why , when he arrived in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ a pass behind the Malmö defense , he finished in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in an Play @-@ off , proposed to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was rounded up with a five @-@ man def@@ ender and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ eger P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G herself came up sometimes with some patches and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which in no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned because Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria in a shooting down , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had made his sixth win of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö would be coming back to the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , could with@@ stand the end result before the substitute judge Ez@@ ekiel Lav@@ e@@ zzi a fool at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age , Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then in the occupation of the film , and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted out , with offensive Un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the acting of The Mar@@ tian settled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined forces of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is sm@@ itten down from her white turn .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio &apos;s direction @-@ rights at film ; Dam@@ on said that her direc@@ ting &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;

Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pulled his anger onto the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO W@@ ING that it &apos;s hur@@ ting . &quot;
the Twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time , at the accurate rac@@ ical representation in the media at the top of the social debate .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks in Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ I W@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins for@@ ked a chance for A@@ scen@@ sion into the world of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League winning game .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , there was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to hold over a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories do have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad R@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support upright when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled the three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the designated Tiger model Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sharp@@ ened the punch about it , &quot; said extinction .
he looked good at the ( drum@@ stick ) saw clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three gro@@ oves in the back at the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the ning with a double on the left @-@ hand line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks att@@ ained a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left @-@ handed .
Har@@ dy was over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted , in front of the newly designed ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who plan a two @-@ run in front of the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runner and the finale run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
the major league was the major league in the Major League this season with Pl@@ ou@@ ffe an Double Play hit .
at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , I added a Insurance @-@ Run , the Wall designed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander but S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for its fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit goes to the start of the game by an even mot@@ ion@@ less Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers generated three inst@@ ant@@ ments in the first two Inn@@ ings on the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after he had ste@@ als over a month because of the suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for me , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; but I felt better when I started and sens@@ ed that I would make some quite good pitch here in the third inning . &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter there was one single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z presented Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z playing in the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succe@@ eds the 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right hand , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid out in second , achieved one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great impact , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not find especially well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a position of the Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , played no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rele@@ gs A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , at a Hughes , three R@@ uns were hit by six hits and a walk @-@ up walk .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of a bre@@ aches of the throw @-@ school .
he is investig@@ ating Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who worked on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder di@@ stortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the vulner@@ ability list to fight against T@@ wins .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often de@@ pressed by them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

his negative impressions had the effect to rein@@ force him from histori@@ ans in his future fight against Rome .
Luther was then initiated by his Th@@ eses against the break @-@ in trade in the evening of the evening .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ilded ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the principal works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated bi@@ ble texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has out@@ lined his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the particular topics are adapted , that can quite be very dark .
about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles involved , subject to subjects such as cross roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
it has spont@@ aneously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who devoted himself to painting with the respective biblical question .
he interpreted the Bible images selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current con@@ jun@@ ctions in today . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of al@@ ts painting .
nestled among the original bi@@ omet@@ ry of Martin Luther and a set of an artist , who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts on their own situation .
the jewellery band consists of gold cou@@ sins .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allow twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grown up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant stand .
&quot; since the up@@ bringing was already with the tube , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt looks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to quit the work to wear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is that art in a quick time can lead to more opportunities : &quot; the perception of nature worlds is characterised by advertising today , and that is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures always have mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt let the viewer want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art have been to be : &quot; I like he gra@@ ze with his paintings . &quot;
old did not pay attention to enum@@ er@@ ate the Bible , but the important issues were also selected for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the images that explains text &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the Bible says , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler , from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öhler both ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ foundation .
construction start for BM@@ X trains
plans were made , space found , company commissioned to model@@ ed ground level for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already over .
inci@@ dents in politics and administration provided emergency , especially with residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for permission .
in October , permission will go away in October , the first congregation of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock from the child &apos;s youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other memorial pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga has a clear sign for the Bundesliga .
football will react to a sensitive location in Germany and safegu@@ ard its assistance to the problems of rising problems .
&quot; I &apos;m getting this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can tell in principle that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must always be interested in getting this issue into the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DF@@ B chef Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel meet on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ tions to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister for the State Minister , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; this topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football weighs and helps .
the decisive moves must however place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German soccer federation has thus expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee movement for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach declared on the fr@@ inge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some states support this program .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ de will set a clear sign when it took on the left tri@@ cot to the left of the usual sponsor logo ( Hermes ) to carry the &apos; We Help &apos; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler described the project as &quot; granted . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every way , nobody can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; we are able to be soccer to Bundesliga , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees that have already been so incredibly suffering , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
the team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale invites you to visit Hungary on this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community with German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had launched in their own projects , be great .
it &apos;s as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , are living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this and the next year , the association will present itself with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , each 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kid@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of SAP @-@ President loses a eye when accident
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , according to several reports , reportedly eliminated the left eye by the fall of July .
following an accident at the stairs in the home of his brother in the USA , he dropped to a water @-@ glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , then went out tow@@ ed into the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could however pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet with the Supervisory Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager may be at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully oper@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everybody can do something like this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to get up again if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ G without R@@ eus against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes have definitely sm@@ ashed the com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group Game of the Europa League .
the national player will also miss the soccer player in the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t go back at him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday .
if R@@ eus appears to be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match of Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach said : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem from the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the place of tri@@ mmed Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher at the World Champion .
whether wil@@ de@@ f@@ eller is ready to use in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the real statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League had to be the target , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as a comprehen@@ sible : &quot; so Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to interc@@ ept the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany will be the process of technological pioneering .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to adopt a strategic ban@@ ker from the home of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Frankfurt on Wednesday in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated driving , automated driving will increase road safety and raise expectations for less payments , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart from the G7 , which were also coinci@@ ding with representatives of the industry .
the strategic management of the Ministry of Transport also emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a continuous stream of digital radio teleph@@ ony .
the test run on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is being tested for testing new technology .
to ensure that the driver will be &quot; no additional Dis@@ claim@@ er &quot; if the federal government is to review the legal framework conditions , &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to dep@@ loy Germany to use the acceptable top speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees human beings as a driver .
when driving , driving , the car becomes the lead , the driver will be driving more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some drivers on public roads could still be expected to be expected so far in 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the high automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study to approximately 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
a pol@@ l based on the AA survey conducted by the For@@ se Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA Laboratory comes to the result that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect this , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the US .
if the drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following an elevation of the digital airline Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree that check @-@ in throughout the entire roads .
at the highway there could be at least 15 per cent in continuous traffic , a figure of 45 percent .
gut everyone would leave the car the control under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a big loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it tomorrow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ train@@ ers Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM &apos;s course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo went missing , and we &apos;re European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figures show : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look happily for video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which was decorated with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s staged out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in rolls .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &quot; The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown on September 18 in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his turn to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he would have been , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show was a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been in Montreal in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this man &apos;s work , written by fashion history , having ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is a great chore@@ ographic total work that was done with lots of effort to eat the d@@ olls , for example , was a styl@@ ist is involved .
14 tons of material have moved according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest was another special pair of Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ f : a leather bel@@ fry fit with cork .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said .
G@@ aul @-@ old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , cl@@ assy fashionable attempts to design the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was clothed in his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said G@@ aul .
with a doll to play , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he t@@ oss the thing in fashion to teach himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them then naturally .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
they got nothing , but we were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - pointed tip as a fashion niche
previously , it went to the long metal @-@ moul@@ ding machines in and around pl@@ ur@@ ry to make up , metres .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large amounts for customers , which they worked for example for ceiling and she@@ er curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the lead wire .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the starting times of the Pl@@ eni@@ ener Sp@@ itz , fashion has played a greater role , then ra@@ ced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt gives some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
generally , the so @-@ called Vintage fashion that leans on past bull , an increasing of the client .
who does not have an NGO in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
it is already half of all orders .
horse ra@@ ins Pl@@ auen is joined together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private specialised businesses and retail stores are almost no longer available .
our products are unlikely to achieve our customers on this path .
these mass goods are much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
it is also weak to export , currently to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association also aims to score by environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ broi@@ dery in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we are taking a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor area of the School of Fine Arts - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
this will create a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economical above all , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only slightly distinct to keep a customer base .
a few years ago animated cell designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ produces the historic snow band .
the machine wi@@ dens little kis@@ ses in some places .
the pl@@ asti@@ er Gold@@ sch@@ mie@@ de Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se inspired himself : &quot; before that I was able to do nothing with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the tip of snow for their jewellery .
in an elabor@@ ate process , they expressed the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ isch@@ ers - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in building and surroundings , and who want to take a piece of souven@@ irs .
with this , I see my jewelry as modern am@@ bass@@ adors of the Pl@@ eni@@ ener tip .

XI is pushing to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wider out@@ ward to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday , a group that was t@@ asked with the steering of reform .
&quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the central management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
new @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vitality , and new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting state establishments ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants area .
after the statement a negative list is created , the sectors and businesses identified , which will not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it suggests a greater role in the allocation of resource , a legally binding business environment , and the market open , &quot; said the statement .
the government will also provide inspec@@ tions about the powers that are transferred to companies and make sure companies will decide how they perform their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
additional areas for private investment will be opened within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , for foreigners make it easier to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by simpli@@ fying the demands and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the right of lawyers to ass@@ ert their activity , and using professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting too .
the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ or
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ or and consumers , thereby improve a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding paper at the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values of the nerve gi@@ ft@@ es for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; of one kil@@ ogram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly polluted with mercury that they may not be sold on the basis of existing boundary values around 50 percent of the catch .
after the dou@@ bling of the boundary values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be still in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU plans to intensi@@ fy the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch explains this as &quot; trick , &quot; because small cem@@ ented names , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low charged that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore a &quot; per@@ fi@@ ant di@@ stra@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt said .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that strongly att@@ ests over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the federal government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause severe damage from the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Finance states on his homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard in the general population &quot; was not to be expected .
mercury extends above all by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Technology , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ries ordered more than six tons of mercury in total , two @-@ thirds of mercury in Germany in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in Pis@@ ces , the Rhine and Danube , have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide sur@@ passing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , all @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish have already used the most frequently reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
