purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine in implementing the provisions of the part I on backup measures as required .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of significant amounts of significant amounts of nuclear materials for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ps for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such an account by the risk of early detection .
in the calculation of article 28 set out , the material accounting as a backup will be used as a backup of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as an important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the retro@@ spec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material image , which is listed for a certain period of time , including the accuracy of the data limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
the organization after article 3 full use of the communion of the Community also makes the organisation of article 3 full use .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on an outline in materials zones .
when applying their backup measures , the community of procedures and practices will make use of the following kind of use , and if necessary , see how they are determined and pur@@ pose@@ ful in the comple@@ ment@@ ing agreements .
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ ated , sm@@ ashed , lost , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of remote material and of the inventory ;
( B ) evaluating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of measurement certainty ;
C ) Proc@@ edure for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proc@@ edure in the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;

g ) precautions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) Proc@@ edure for the reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures according to these agreements does not extend to material in mining , or in preparation .
B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ental material that has not yet reached the code of the nuclear fuel cycle , into the states , so the community of organisation shares the amount and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity in fuel production , or the processing phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced this nuclear material , or else , in a later stage of the kernel @-@ burning kernel that is introduced to the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention .
a ) The measures mentioned in this Convention shall not be completed for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community claims are subject to evidence that the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures according to this agreement is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and community one another over the use of appropriate backup measures .
B ) The security measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated in accordance with the conditions listed in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community notice that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ winning .
on request of the Community the organization releases the following core material from the backup measures following this Convention :

the organization is based on the basis of article 62 mentioned above @-@ mentioned index order of the entire , the security measures of this Convention underground material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and results in this inventory due to the following reports and the results of their check @-@ ups .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) .
in ER@@ AL TA@@ TION NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help the Conference on International Economic Cooperation with a special response program to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes , whose development is impe@@ ded by general resource centre problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States amoun@@ ted to into force within six months , and as far as possible within two years , entered into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its possible so that this goal is achieved .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ bind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has submitted a table , from which it is obvious , in what way it intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organisation addresses a special account under the name &quot; Special Day account &quot; which Member States should contribute to the special account , and this account will be used by the organization as ste@@ ad@@ minister@@ ial conference , and this will only be referred to as the purpose stated in this agreement and pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement .
the special account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ a of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ ins@@ tic deb@@ tors of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order as administr@@ ated by the special actions of the organization and in the depos@@ iting organisation of the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is carried out in two edges , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 V . h . the article on 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or any other agreed between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual bud@@ get@@ ary plans .
C ) Every@@ member state may wish to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned terminology .
the car@@ et@@ aker considers the usual procedures of the organization about dis@@ proportionate draw on cash or the debt to cover the expenses of the promotions and the special actions in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be led by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent where international economic factors have contributed to the current and current economic problems of the country ;
VI ) The composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt and its further loan capacity to loan conditions without delay ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can arrange contributions from other sources .
any special response loan will serve the financing of a clearly identifiable and rapidly @-@ paid development program or proj@@ ections ( including a sec@@ toral Plan ) , regardless of whether it &apos;s the loan programme of the organization funded or not , according to the procedures and practices approved by the financing funds of the organization funded by the Pre@@ am@@ ble ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to take into account the objective of additives .
the funds of special actions must not be used instead of arranged funds from the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation .
apart from section 4 are subject to the same payout percentage terms , which are generally applicable to the Organisation for the Organisation for Development and they are reimbur@@ sed in 50 years in each case in 50 years .
the promotions can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
the amounts for the payment of these commandments are directly to the organization that keeps them retained .
every specialized loan agreement is determined by a separate loan agreement between the vessel and car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is indicated .
the income from any special response rate can be used for expenses in the currency of the consumer country or for goods or services produced in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are determined and which , according to the measures contained at the time of the loan granted , will be the recipient of a special reaction .
capital pay@@ outs from special actions can take place at the special account , and in this way the amount paid by a member state shall return to the Member State after his receipt as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker gives up to the complete publishing of all special actions by the EEC on the Commission for testing by the directors in preparation and about the plans approved by the directors and programmes .
during the period of the payout of the promotions they have taught the EEC quarterly on the development of special actions and the expenditure for this expenditure .
the administrator submitted the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the fiscal year of the organization , a detailed account of the special response times , with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
after full payout of the promotions they have been transmitted the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the project @-@ financing projects and programs .
the car@@ et@@ aker created and carries out suitable records and billing , from which contributions to the special response account , which exp@@ ires in the account and are visible from the account and can be seen from the account balance and the return payments to the member states .
the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff to the complete issue of the special response time of time to time a thought of thought about the state of the special response accounts , the progress of the funded programs or projects and about any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement .

agreement in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium term financial crisis
the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by @-@ credit agreement with central banks of the creditors , if the banks place their respective application .
the agreements could be closed until the total amount issued by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion billing units ; this equivalent to 50 % of all future distribution units of member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , now there are some conditions listed below , for whose application the B@@ IS would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially assume a commitment for two years , whereby the possibility of renew@@ ing stocks , without having to be sur@@ passed a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as with their wa@@ iter @-@ term extension , the B@@ IS would charge a credit application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it would be agreed that the first pulling will not be made before the expiry of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the draw would be made available in the remaining currencies at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods that are taking into account the funds of the bank , expected to take three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who address the B@@ IS at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market approaches .
if the BI@@ Z has the necessary means to proc@@ ure even on the market , then the necessary interest rate could reach a maximum of interest rate , which is equivalent to the corresponding Mar@@ ge increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would send me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

a re@@ agent to blood group @-@ determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen , which is the substance referred to the antibodies or any other on the label substance .
if a re@@ agent used in the way recommended by the manufacturer may not occur the following factors or appar@@ i@@ tions : a ) hä@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured by always a renewed di@@ lution of the subject to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ ver@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be charged exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
with anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents who are supposed to be used in object , the activity is expressed by the time which is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ group international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at present standards .
a International standard product , according to definition , contains a certain number of national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans that are observed during individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational elements , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ni@@ vor@@ ate .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents to blood group determination , available for the International Standard prepar@@ edness ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the title of the un@@ known re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prin@@ ter or a state standard in International units ( See bul@@ letin , WHO 1 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties are to be maintained at least one year .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ essi@@ o form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficiency test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is geared towards the results of the shelf life ; it has been approved by the government supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass containers , in which they have been dried and which is so closed , that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent can lose most of 0.5 b.@@ H. of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or which is added with the drying process delivered solutions ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to be the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group @-@ determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ white nitrogen per ml cur@@ l or re @-@ resolved ser@@ um .
re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ essi@@ mis@@ ger or after the release , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor g@@ ele or visible particles .
the provisions for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for blood group @-@ determination should not be painted in arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as not until an International Convention has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents to the blood group determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that in a container well @-@ being re@@ agen@@ z is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so large in a container that the contents may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the producer @-@ Board has to guide through all the production stages and checks of the re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ by written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents re@@ agents are so long run from the laboratory of laboratory until some likelihood can be assumed that the char@@ gers can no longer be used .
the re@@ agents of the re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent an effective share , the others are the necessary tools to enhance the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agents .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective proportions in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents could not contain any substances of human origin .
on each container , there is a black and white label in English and French , containing the following information : 1. name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid consumed
furthermore , this label or the label on the cardboard , in which the individual containers are located , or the containers attached to the instruction is contained : 1 complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
