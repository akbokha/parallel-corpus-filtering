should core material , the backup measures to be used after this Convention , in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the Community with the organization of such use of material under which circumstances the backup measures can be completed after this Convention in relation to this material .
II ) that the ker@@ shell is not used during the duration of the non @-@ care of the security measures according to the Convention for the production of nuclear weapons and other core cells .
B ) The organization and the community meet the provision that the security measures envisaged in this Convention will not be used for as long as the core material used in such an activity .
the scheme will be defined as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these backup measures are not applied .
in any case , the security measures envisaged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization will be held on the total amount and the composition of this material in the country or in the relevant state , and on any passing of such material , out of this state or states out of the current state .
this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as time @-@ time and procedur@@ al rules and agreements for reporting , but does not cover a endor@@ sement or a secret protection of the military activity , and does not refer to the successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs which each of them grow at the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention .
arise by the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereign power , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special up@@ setting of the organization , so reimbur@@ se the organization this cost , provided that it has been explained in advance .
the organisation in any case bears the cost of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the community and states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be avail@@ ed upon the organization and its officials for the purpose of implementing this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states .
any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organisation in relation to the organization or a state because of damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , which have emerged from the implementation of the backup measures according to the Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
provides the Council for examining the fac@@ tual information presented by the Direc@@ torate @-@ General , that the organization has not been able to verify itself by proof that no core material must be imposed after this Convention , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ ts , so he may refund the reports provided in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take place on the other measures .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the council , in which mass it has been obtained through the applied backup measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the advice the necessary safety .
upon request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations on issues instead of issues resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the community and the states are entitled to seek that questions arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes relating to Article 19 or any of the Council , there are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which will not be contracted by negotiation or other form of organisation , community and states , at the request of an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and states design@@ ate two refer@@ ee , the organization also identifies two refer@@ ee , and the four designated arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , who runs the chair .
have the community and the states or the organization final days after the request to a refer@@ ee will not be named two arbitr@@ ator , so the community or the organization shall seek the President of the International Court of court to appoint these refer@@ ee .
the same procedure is to apply when bin@@ ations three days after the naming or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbit@@ er has not yet been elected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the arbitration proceedings are pun@@ ching , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisions of the arbitration rules are binding on the organisation , the community and the countries concerned .

purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine in implementing the provisions of the part I on backup measures as required .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of significant amounts of significant amounts of nuclear materials for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ps for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such an account by the risk of early detection .
in the calculation of article 28 set out , the material accounting as a backup will be used as a backup of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as an important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the retro@@ spec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material image , which is listed for a certain period of time , including the accuracy of the data limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
the organization after article 3 full use of the communion of the Community also makes the organisation of article 3 full use .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on an outline in materials zones .
when applying their backup measures , the community of procedures and practices will make use of the following kind of use , and if necessary , see how they are determined and pur@@ pose@@ ful in the comple@@ ment@@ ing agreements .
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ ated , sm@@ ashed , lost , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of remote material and of the inventory ;
( B ) evaluating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of measurement certainty ;
C ) Proc@@ edure for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proc@@ edure in the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;

the backup measures according to these agreements does not extend to material in mining , or in preparation .
B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ental material that has not yet reached the code of the nuclear fuel cycle , into the states , so the community of organisation shares the amount and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity in fuel production , or the processing phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced this nuclear material , or else , in a later stage of the kernel @-@ burning kernel that is introduced to the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention .
a ) The measures mentioned in this Convention shall not be completed for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community claims are subject to evidence that the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures according to this agreement is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and community one another over the use of appropriate backup measures .
B ) The security measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated in accordance with the conditions listed in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community notice that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ winning .
on request of the Community the organization releases the following core material from the backup measures following this Convention :

the organization is based on the basis of article 62 mentioned above @-@ mentioned index order of the entire , the security measures of this Convention underground material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and results in this inventory due to the following reports and the results of their check @-@ ups .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) .
in ER@@ AL TA@@ TION NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ √ú@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help the Conference on International Economic Cooperation with a special response program to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes , whose development is impe@@ ded by general resource centre problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States amoun@@ ted to into force within six months , and as far as possible within two years , entered into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its possible so that this goal is achieved .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ bind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has submitted a table , from which it is obvious , in what way it intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organisation addresses a special account under the name &quot; Special Day account &quot; which Member States should contribute to the special account , and this account will be used by the organization as ste@@ ad@@ minister@@ ial conference , and this will only be referred to as the purpose stated in this agreement and pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement .
the special account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ a of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ ins@@ tic deb@@ tors of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order as administr@@ ated by the special actions of the organization and in the depos@@ iting organisation of the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is carried out in two edges , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 V . h . the article on 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or any other agreed between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual bud@@ get@@ ary plans .
C ) Every@@ member state may wish to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned terminology .
the car@@ et@@ aker considers the usual procedures of the organization about dis@@ proportionate draw on cash or the debt to cover the expenses of the promotions and the special actions in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be led by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent where international economic factors have contributed to the current and current economic problems of the country ;
VI ) The composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt and its further loan capacity to loan conditions without delay ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can arrange contributions from other sources .
any special response loan will serve the financing of a clearly identifiable and rapidly @-@ paid development program or proj@@ ections ( including a sec@@ toral Plan ) , regardless of whether it &apos;s the loan programme of the organization funded or not , according to the procedures and practices approved by the financing funds of the organization funded by the Pre@@ am@@ ble ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to take into account the objective of additives .
the funds of special actions must not be used instead of arranged funds from the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation .
apart from section 4 are subject to the same payout percentage terms , which are generally applicable to the Organisation for the Organisation for Development and they are reimbur@@ sed in 50 years in each case in 50 years .
the promotions can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
the amounts for the payment of these commandments are directly to the organization that keeps them retained .
every specialized loan agreement is determined by a separate loan agreement between the vessel and car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is indicated .
the income from any special response rate can be used for expenses in the currency of the consumer country or for goods or services produced in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are determined and which , according to the measures contained at the time of the loan granted , will be the recipient of a special reaction .
capital pay@@ outs from special actions can take place at the special account , and in this way the amount paid by a member state shall return to the Member State after his receipt as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker gives up to the complete publishing of all special actions by the EEC on the Commission for testing by the directors in preparation and about the plans approved by the directors and programmes .
during the period of the payout of the promotions they have taught the EEC quarterly on the development of special actions and the expenditure for this expenditure .
the administrator submitted the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the fiscal year of the organization , a detailed account of the special response times , with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
after full payout of the promotions they have been transmitted the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the project @-@ financing projects and programs .
the car@@ et@@ aker created and carries out suitable records and billing , from which contributions to the special response account , which exp@@ ires in the account and are visible from the account and can be seen from the account balance and the return payments to the member states .
the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff to the complete issue of the special response time of time to time a thought of thought about the state of the special response accounts , the progress of the funded programs or projects and about any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement .
is this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation may not be agreed , not into force , so the agreement and all arising obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect .

the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by @-@ credit agreement with central banks of the creditors , if the banks place their respective application .
the agreements could be closed until the total amount issued by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion billing units ; this equivalent to 50 % of all future distribution units of member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , now there are some conditions listed below , for whose application the B@@ IS would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially assume a commitment for two years , whereby the possibility of renew@@ ing stocks , without having to be sur@@ passed a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as with their wa@@ iter @-@ term extension , the B@@ IS would charge a credit application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it would be agreed that the first pulling will not be made before the expiry of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the draw would be made available in the remaining currencies at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods that are taking into account the funds of the bank , expected to take three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who address the B@@ IS at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market approaches .
if the BI@@ Z has the necessary means to proc@@ ure even on the market , then the necessary interest rate could reach a maximum of interest rate , which is equivalent to the corresponding Mar@@ ge increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would send me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could conclude a stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of the creditors , if banks make their respective application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I adore me to take the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish rules on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations are the two parties as follows :
- fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
within the framework of this agreement the export @-@ possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual quantity : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) .
to ensure the impeccable functioning of the agreement , Argentina , comm@@ its by suitable procedures to ensure that the fact carried out the agreed quantity not exceeds the agreed quantity , and executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade is possible , so the two parties of this agreement consult together with the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .

number 2 @-@ mentioned total amount will be fixed by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community of 23 000 tons of battle weight .
the community takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ing on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community takes precautions so that the sales of interven@@ ing fires at frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of the Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb was not under@@ mines .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of re@@ funds or other conve@@ ying measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb were only at prices and conditions which are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade .
these terms are in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention relating to the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular that it is specified in the quantities specified in this agreement for the goods listed under number 1 .
the community committed itself to meet all necessary precautions so that the classification of con@@ fu@@ hr@@ ates for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is based on the presentation of a export licence , which is responsible for granted by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government .

the tender means that the agreement is properly applied and is working faul@@ t@@ lessly .
he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s flesh on both sides and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions which are of significance for the target number 7 .
the Committee is concerned that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat are under the agreement not mentioned under the agreement under the agreement .
the Committee deals all with the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply un@@ due to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the number 2 fixed annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount will take place from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January . January of the following year is set in proportion to the total @-@ year total and contributes to the seasonal character of trade .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat
I honour me , on the negotiations between our two delegations to define rules on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb was vital to the world market , and in particular , according to the community for the New Zealand , H@@ amm@@ el and lamb was not affected to these markets , I will find the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
after this agreement , New Zealand is secured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat to access the community of the Community where the agreement is established in the agreement .
New Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his H@@ amm@@ el and lamb was not drawn through the application of the regulation in compassion .
to ensure the impeccable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand , by suitable procedures ensure that the actual amount did not exceed the set quantity .
the set @-@ standing quantities are carried out in the conventional offer ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from using new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the Community .
should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade is possible , so we consult the two contractual parties before introducing such a change in the clause 10 mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community assumes the clause clause , it is obliged to protect themselves from this Agreement &apos;s interests New Zealand .
in the event that the revenue from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community retains the right to eradic@@ ate those we ro@@ de in this country .
the community ple@@ dged to restrict the un@@ added value to inser@@ tion made by this agreement to a twe@@ et rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in consultation with New Zealand &apos;s accession to New Zealand , the Community changes in clause 2 fixed quantities according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new member state .

the total amount of clause 2 @-@ called total will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of battle weight .
the community takes everything in order to avoid market development , which could affect the normal paragraph of H@@ amm@@ el H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ing on the common market within the agreed quantities .

New Zealand guarantees the compliance with the quantities in clause 2 in particular , that there is no export licenses to these quantities .
the community committed itself to meet all necessary precautions so that the distribution of inc@@ iner@@ ators for the aforementioned products were subject to origin in New Zealand by the presentation of a export licence to be held responsible for by the newly appointed government .
the details of the application of this system shall be defined so that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import of import can be avoided .
in transitional regulations , it is also specified that the relevant legal authority of the competent authority of the Community has been granted in regular intervals , to de@@ code the quantities , for the export licenses ; this information may be conclu@@ sive , if necessary .
the tender contributes to the fact that the agreement is working properly and is working faul@@ t@@ lessly .
the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat &apos;s flesh on both sides and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions which are of significance for the clause 7 @-@ called target .
the Committee does not concern that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat under the agreement are not executed according to the collective bar@@ numbers of the Community .

in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I adore me to take the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish rules on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations are the two parties as follows :
- fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective , 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( collective , 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
within the framework of this agreement the export @-@ possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay has been set to the following annual amount :
to ensure the impeccable functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , due to appropriate procedures ensure that the fact carried out the agreed quantity not exceeds the agreed quantity , and executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade is possible , so the two parties of this agreement consult together with the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes to claim the protection clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access of Uruguay access to the common market is not touched during this agreement .
in the event that the revenue from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the community retains the right to susp@@ end the deposit from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community ple@@ dged to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to the import of the products made by this agreement to a twe@@ et rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in consultation with new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen trade with each new member state .
the import @-@ bur@@ dens for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession Act ; this will be borne by the invoice under number 5 above .
the total number mentioned under number 2 is fixed by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of battle weight .
the community takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ing on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community takes precautions so that the sales of interven@@ ing fires at frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation referred to the paragraph of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ic creative .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of re@@ funds or other conve@@ ying measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb were only at prices and conditions which are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade .
these terms are in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention relating to the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and Trade Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay is ensured the compliance of this agreement in particular that it is given in the quantities specified in this agreement for the goods listed under number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in turn , the community committed itself to meet all necessary precautions so that the distribution of inc@@ iner@@ ators for pre @-@ mentioned products is based in Uruguay on the presentation of a export licence , which is responsible for granted by the us@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen government .
in implementing @-@ regulations , the relevant provincial authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals are given , the quantities have been issued to de@@ code for the export licenses ; these details may be conclu@@ sive , if necessary .
this agreement applies to areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community are applied , and according to the Treaty of the Republic of Austria on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Europe on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it with a notice period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties in front of the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes they require for necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent with this writing .

whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this liberation into the responsibility of the Community exp@@ ires , under which it was established by which it has the powers required to do so ;
whereas , in the implementation of the article 5 paragraph 1 of the convention , it is necessary that the European Economic Community Parties can become the Convention of the Convention -
the Convention advocates the community on the first day of the month in force , which follows the signature .
it enters into force on the first day of the month , followed by the last of the contract parties to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This additional prot@@ ector exp@@ ires after two years after the date when it entered into force , unless one of the contractual parties has added a objection to his entry into force .
from this point onwards , a state cannot be a party of the Convention without being recorded at the same time a party of additional protection .
the Secretary General of the Council of Europe , noti@@ fies all acceptance of the Member States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection , respectively , in the sense of Article 2 , as well as the date of its adoption in Article 2 .
the Secretary General noted also any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention .
whereas it is most desirable when the member states assist in the spirit of European solidarity in the process of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents to each other ,
whereas this mutual support is only possible if procurement and use of these re@@ agents are subject to the blood group in common by the Member States and shall be granted the necessary facilities and exceptions for their import .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this convention , the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , vegetable , vegetable and other origin to the blood group , and to the establishment of blood in@@ toler@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the declaration may be trac@@ ed at any time by one to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the parties will undertake re@@ agents to re@@ agents for the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport as well as if necessary , the purchase price of other contractual parties who need to need it , provided that they have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents to blood group parties will only be provided by other contractual parties only under the condition that they may not be used for medicinal purposes only , that they are used solely for medical purposes and only obtained by the governments involved .
each shipment of re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ determination is a certificate of causing it to be made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its plant represent an administration agreement , changed or comple@@ mented by the governments of the Parties of this Convention .
the Parties meet all necessary measures to free them from other contractual parties to deliver re@@ agents to the blood group by all sub@@ missions .
they also meet all necessary measures in order to ensure that these substances present in Article 3 of the recipients quickly and on the shortest way .
the parties ( parties ) transmit each other about the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , which are authorised for the exhibition in Article 4 provided in Article 4 .
these jobs should be identical to the use in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic agents of human origin .
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe on the signature ; they can be a party , by sign it a ) without reservation of the rati@@ fication or approval .
this Convention takes place one month after the day in force , on which three members of the Council have signed it according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for each member , the agreement was signed later or ratified without reservations for rati@@ fication or approval , or it will be ratified one month after signing or dis@@ agreement of the rati@@ fication or per@@ mitting certificate .
upon the entry into force of the Convention , the Council of the Council of Europe can invite every non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the contributions of the Council and the name of its members , which have signed or ratified without reservations for rati@@ fication or approval ;
any party party may cancel this agreement with a period of a year by ad to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent to blood group @-@ determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen , which is the substance referred to the antibodies or any other on the label substance .
if a re@@ agent used in the way recommended by the manufacturer may not occur the following factors or appar@@ i@@ tions : a ) h√§@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured by always a renewed di@@ lution of the subject to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ ver@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be charged exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
with anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents who are supposed to be used in object , the activity is expressed by the time which is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ group international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at present standards .
a International standard product , according to definition , contains a certain number of national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans that are observed during individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational elements , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ni@@ vor@@ ate .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents to blood group determination , available for the International Standard prepar@@ edness ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the title of the un@@ known re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prin@@ ter or a state standard in International units ( See bul@@ letin , WHO 1 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties are to be maintained at least one year .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ essi@@ o form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficiency test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is geared towards the results of the shelf life ; it has been approved by the government supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass containers , in which they have been dried and which is so closed , that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent can lose most of 0.5 b.@@ H. of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or which is added with the drying process delivered solutions ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to be the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group @-@ determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ white nitrogen per ml cur@@ l or re @-@ resolved ser@@ um .
re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ essi@@ mis@@ ger or after the release , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor g@@ ele or visible particles .
the provisions for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for blood group @-@ determination should not be painted in arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as not until an International Convention has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents to the blood group determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that in a container well @-@ being re@@ agen@@ z is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so large in a container that the contents may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the producer @-@ Board has to guide through all the production stages and checks of the re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ by written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents re@@ agents are so long run from the laboratory of laboratory until some likelihood can be assumed that the char@@ gers can no longer be used .
the re@@ agents of the re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent an effective share , the others are the necessary tools to enhance the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agents .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective proportions in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents could not contain any substances of human origin .
on each container , there is a black and white label in English and French , containing the following information : 1. name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid consumed
furthermore , this label or the label on the cardboard , in which the individual containers are located , or the containers attached to the instruction is contained : 1 complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
