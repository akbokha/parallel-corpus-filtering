it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg m@@ elt tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to inc@@ ur ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B.

A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe Man@@ ic episodes and in the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
both diseases can take the solution to the inc@@ ision or the melting in patients may be used to prevent the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are exactly as bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole mainly works as a &quot; particip@@ atory &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schizophrenia , and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ occur is prevented .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy , the res@@ isting of symptoms to prevent was investigated in three studies by up to one year .
the effectiveness of an injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabili@@ zed over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with half @-@ i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and placebo , taking recur@@ rence patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with axi@@ fy .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy injection moul@@ ding solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to severe anxiety , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms experienced by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also resulted in studies to investigate how the body absorbed the m@@ elt @-@ coated tablets and the solution to the inc@@ ision ( decreasing ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients , A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest as the patients who received a placebo .
when applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy are more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previous patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of severe anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of bili@@ fy . ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyram@@ idal disorders , crus@@ hing , nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea ( nausea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping @-@ dys@@ functions , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping @-@ dys@@ functions , in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate @-@ heavy ones at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole languages , compared with the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophrenia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar disorder , when a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients shown that predominantly man@@ ic episodes had and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
having regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients should be considered a lower initi@@ ald@@ osis if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior is part of psycho@@ tic disease and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated su@@ icide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ zene in comparison to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( stretching de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure recept@@ or ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ted and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less di@@ gest@@ ed , there were occasional reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ oning Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if at any one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients are signs of signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sp@@ hin@@ der , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with scrat@@ ches in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are used with var@@ ic@@ ans in the context of caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole , a higher ster@@ y compared to the placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and the anus for unwanted dis@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , which allow direct comparisons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
gaining weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polarity man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ot@@ z@@ ole on the central system caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with itself over@@ lag@@ ging side effects such as se@@ dation is taken ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , an ga@@ stri@@ c blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered as clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy commission increased a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
if you consider the common Gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to patients .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV / Prot@@ eas@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
after filing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age before the beginning of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ ers concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data of safety in humans and due to the concerns of animal temper@@ ed concerns , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify clearly the potential risk to the fet@@ us .
however , with other anti@@ psycho@@ tic patients the patients should be warned against it , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , which participated in the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , in which approximately three quarters had formerly been an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in some property or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el pharmaceutical drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , they spoke 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ sive patients treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional customer @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , among patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , that my@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
it may also not be applied in patients , the breastfeeding or before the beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ y .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that my@@ x@@ ane in patients where the first treatment was no longer acceptable , more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines and that it does not have to be associated with other medicines as opposed to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
January 2008 , the European Commission issued the Pro@@ xis of Bio@@ Science Limited , a licence for the transport of my@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
abra@@ sive therapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine is not displayed in @-@ contained therapy ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe neutrality ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ sum &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ ia during the my@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to the following series on 220 mg / m2 .
sensor@@ ic neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 is the treatment to break down to a bet@@ tering to degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and on all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data concerning the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ sive is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ compromising and effectiveness .
abra@@ sives is an album @-@ dedicated nan@@ op@@ articles of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately degra@@ ded and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient should not be treated once again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients there should be no more suscep@@ tible x@@ ane treatment cycles to the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ sum rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thy@@ ro@@ count has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sive .
while one is un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously detected with abra@@ sive cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ac incidents in the indic@@ ative patient collection are not uncommon , particularly in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine in @-@ treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if in the patient , after the gift of my@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and contra@@ sting resources .
abra@@ sive no@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abra@@ sion method .
male patients who are treated with abra@@ sion , will fall , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child .
male patients should be advised before treatment about a spar@@ se conservation , since the therapy with my@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility .
my@@ x@@ ane may cause adverse reactions like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects shown on 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome , which were treated in the phase III study of 260 mg / m2 all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( reported at 79 % of patients ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia has been reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the Gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ o @-@ ingredient that promotes the gra@@ vit@@ cation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube @-@ indic@@ ative and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their land@@ oly@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vit@@ ational interaction and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is well known that album conve@@ ys the trans@@ cy@@ te osis of plasma components into the endo@@ th@@ el@@ et cells and in the context of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies , has been proven that the presence of al@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is given by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ album recept@@ or and is due to the al@@ bu@@ zz@@ ling Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tum@@ ors .
the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two inv@@ ari@@ ed un@@ used studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om .
this multi @-@ centric study conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma carried out every 3 weeks with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with preventive response ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised public state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ ms .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree of patients , which were evaluated for a peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy grade 3 , evaluated .
the natural course of the peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy for precip@@ itation on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxicity of abra@@ sions after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and continues to be unknown .
the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of the overall @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of my@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposure ( AU@@ C ) raised a linear range of 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of my@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plastic concentration took on a multi@@ disciplinary manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or past@@ oral transmission of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic characteristics of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were matched to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ecting of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the abra@@ sive @-@ sized Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was gra@@ ft higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el primarily leads to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ ur@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , the average value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ism of the un@@ altered ingredient of 4 % of the given total dose was less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching Clear@@ ance Clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; Refer@@ ences &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood fer@@ rous complications in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur if prior to the procedure a self @-@ bleeding is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to let their own blood flow , Ab@@ s@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection may also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ ors , provided they have received adequate instructions .
patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per de@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to verify that no iron lack is made , and iron supple@@ mental should be administered throughout the course of treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ al deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used in front of operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which an gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which makes it enabled for the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who caused an@@ a@@ emia issues caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were either pushed to se@@ amed or continue E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ als between the beginning of the study and the period period between the weeks 25 and 29 .
in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study conducted with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ aries of patients were killed on the same degree as for those patients who continue to maintain E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients continued to continue E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the value value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ eping headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are required to make sure this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the drug has been undertaken according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ prec@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , is provided for medical professionals in all Member States information packages , including information on the safety of the drug .
August 2007 the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Drugs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for approval of se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ware ly@@ mph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m My@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .

an@@ esthe@@ tic symptoms and fol@@ l@@ ad can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease safety ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial of disease and disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally a patient can occasionally be observed in a patient @-@ glo@@ om@@ bin@@ aries about or under the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target @-@ concentration .
given these h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ari@@ ability , about an appropriate dosage management should be tried to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ant increases by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bell is worth 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored ti@@ ghter to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest available dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ esthe@@ tic symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with attached very low h@@ B value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ l or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher yields than patients , where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less heavily pronounced ( H@@ B &gt; 8 g / d@@ l or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with attached very low h@@ B value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / d@@ l or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher yields than patients , where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less heavily pronounced ( H@@ B &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / d@@ l or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose is 50 % / kg three times per week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of a dose of 25 / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired goal is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ esthe@@ tic symptoms and - fol@@ dable may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease safety ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial of disease and disease is required by the doctor .

there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human body poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human in@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at tum@@ our patients with the aim of reaching a h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ant under 13 g / d@@ l because a few patients with these characteristics were included in the audi@@ ted data .

acet@@ one is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis is used : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tion@@ risk ( bone break@@ ings ) , including in patients having recently suffered a reduced trau@@ matic aber@@ ration like in the infection ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get are taking at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with gir@@ dle should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) shortly after the application of action may be reduced in the three days following the in@@ fusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
since the substance in action is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a portion of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of acet@@ sta .
during the first trial , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and gir@@ ths have been investigated over a period of three years .
the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered an im@@ pedi@@ ment ; it was evaluated the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spine contrac@@ tions was reduced to patients under action ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) with those under placebo the risk of Hü@@ ft@@ frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip replacement , 9 % of patients under acet@@ ate had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of acet@@ ate occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
acet@@ one may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all the phosph@@ ates patients , patients in the risk of kidney patients are subject to the risk of renal cancer , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ c@@ ass ( die of bone tissues ) in the j@@ aw@@ s .
the maker of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides awareness material for doctors that incorpor@@ ates ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which contains references as the medicine is , as well as the similar material for patients , in which the effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical supply of the envelope . ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ought to be prescribed only by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with ac@@ la@@ sta , a long R@@ emis@@ sion period was observed in patients who addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , an Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ ate can be reduced by the gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen , or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of acet@@ ate .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) In case patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group are available .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , as data can be missing and effectiveness .
acet@@ ate is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for this patient population has only limited clinical experiences .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is used before the start of therapy with ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic on the bone construction , a temporary , occasionally develop symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days of the in@@ fusion of action ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
additionally it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .

kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which were referred to as the decrease of the renal function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , associated .
the change in the creation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis for more than three years compared to the acet@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift has been observed at 1.8 percent of patients treated with acet@@ ate patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on evaluating the laboratory studies , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal variation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with acet@@ ate in a large clinical study patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ ate in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies .
all patients were supple@@ mentary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study for the avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent exp@@ ires , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received a Initi@@ ald@@ osis vitamin D in front of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic in a large clinical study has been reported on local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the Kiev area was occasionally used , particularly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the max@@ il@@ area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ i@@ re@@ - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plastic concentration camp ) .
a diminished clearing of through cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous substances is unlikely , because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic cannot be metabo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because they are a w@@ ak@@ age or not a direct and / or irreversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all estrogen , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
when Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure to quickly , and new bone material is being built up , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone construction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bones once more strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you take other medicines / apply and used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are medicines , of which it is known that they are sc@@ anning the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drinks you are concerned that you will have sufficient fluid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
if you have recently broken the hip , the administration of acet@@ ate will be two or more weeks after the operative care of the quarry .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of the Ac@@ coun@@ sta was once missed , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ coun@@ sta Falls you are considering the ending of treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s notice and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , however , are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle , or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ ate .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have such symptoms in yourself after you have received ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , nests and angi@@ o@@ ö@@ e ( such as swelling at the face , the tongue or in the throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the listed side effects you are significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects which are not listed in this usage information .
if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded with 2 ° C up to 8 ° C .
in patients with a short exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate two or more weeks after the operating supply of the shell is to be executed .
before and after administration of acet@@ ate , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic on the bone construction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days of the in@@ fusion of action .
additionally it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice a day of 500 mg elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently exp@@ elled low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 is prof@@ iting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate .

the summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the studies carried out are analysed how the studies carried out by the Committee for Human Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated for recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
acet@@ one is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another diabetes medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ onic acid or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin can be maintained with the onset of action treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ onic har@@ n@@ osis or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s body can be recycled into better and the blood sugar is reduced , causing type @-@ 2 diabetes better .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine was studied in tri@@ ple@@ a ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic crop , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were cut in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
in the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of an additional volume of action to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ onic crop was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional goods of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of action and insulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients who took action in addition to insulin , lowering the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took addition to placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory system ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and mort@@ ar ( diminished sensitivity to matur@@ ing ) .
acet@@ one should not be used in patients which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic ca@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ counting is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 divided the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a approval for the transport of action in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin or in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intolerance ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are no data available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) are to develop a de@@ compression heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of stage .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a heart failure , gaining weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ al Reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a heart failure , gaining weight gain and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ac out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports about heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased risk of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
when the AL@@ T mir@@ rors are increased up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient is designed to point out to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , wa@@ it@@ ch@@ essness and / or darker har@@ n , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should continue , until the pre@@ dict of the laboratory @-@ arguments will be governed by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be stir@@ red by fat deposits , and in some cases it is connected with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a here@@ after , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a slight reduction of the mid @-@ floor values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the h@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in previous controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um and insulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is made as oral or triple Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ onic drug or as a specialist combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reported on an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular de@@ ms , although patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the charged frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , the frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patients ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) among patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is required ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ as@@ ms are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with mixture fibro@@ cide ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) result in a reduction of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced in pregnancy , increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the native sub@@ str@@ ates and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

they lead to a temporary change of the gymn@@ as@@ ors and the re@@ fr@@ acting inde@@ xes of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic ingredients .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T pins on the tri@@ pple of the high @-@ border of the standard range frequently appears as below placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ates .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was around 1.6 % higher than below placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or later .
since the market introduction has rarely reported about in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however more frequently , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summar@@ izing analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to bone bro@@ o@@ tics are random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in communicating with compar@@ atively treated groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro @-@ active study , fac@@ tions at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when the reported top dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator ac@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , resulting in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ le ci@@ dal was continued for over two years to examine the time until the post@@ ure of the therapeutic effects ( defined as h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.5 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ arding study of 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar was adjusted in spite of three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger Optimi@@ zation phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to only have insulin , a reduction in insulin or the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant reduction of the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ qu@@ oti@@ ent was shown as a comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ o@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) has been tested in a small , 18 week investigation into type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tic .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the overall tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as insignificant , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to plac@@ ements , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plas@@ mas@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to plac@@ ements , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels have been found , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced levels were observed .
in a study conducted over 20 weeks of the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one study , not only the so@@ ber @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level , but also improved the high levels of tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des levels , this has an effect on the Tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ z@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the imaging tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular output study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one will quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the peak concentration on un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one generally reaches 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV provides effectiveness in approximately triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is quite pronounced .
in response studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of diges@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ ers pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ del ( 55 % ) and to a lower scale in the res@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the overall active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are smaller in patients with reduced renal function , whereby the rates of oral clearing in the native substance is similar .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to utilize the insulin in effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly compared with another human being .
ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human beings ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the pack@@ et sign@@ age ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e over@@ l@@ ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks of diabetes towards the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the entire European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initi@@ ale effect will be desired along with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle must be exposed under the skin at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly , for example , through a intensified insulin therapy , may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms of symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin delivery ( fast , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ous , long @-@ effective insulin , human or insulin delivery ) and / or producer method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change of dosage .
if the change to ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e is necessary in patients with a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first week or during the first weeks or months after the switch .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal @-@ human insulin , reported that early War@@ n@@ symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less distinct or different from their previous insulin .
travelling to over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor because such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always consult its patients on other medicines .

the effect is within half an hour , the active max is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the overall duration is up to 24 hours .
validity The Res@@ or@@ tic profile is explained in it that the product is a mixture of insulin products with quicker or hesit@@ ant res@@ tic@@ ity .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval of the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed at first , the amount of insulin will need to be re@@ acted quickly , then the amount of the long @-@ effective insulin .
3 If switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id is required in patients with a dosage adjustment , these may be necessary during the first week or during the first weeks or months after the switch .
travelling to over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor because such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who have already had signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sy no@@ des ( &quot; bricks &quot; i.e. greater primitive cryst@@ all@@ ings that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary tract can still be over 6 mg per week after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg .
during the first treatment months still tox@@ ins may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients may take at least during the first six months following treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of tox@@ ins .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , participating at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with which a placebo ( hypo@@ medications ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other drugs for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ f@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary tract in the blood in the last three measurements among 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patient , which took once daily 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients in the case of placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
especially in patients suffering from cardi@@ ac disease in pre @-@ history may also affect an elevated risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary tract in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ ec@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and tox@@ ics .
the primary efficiency of the patients were in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month were determined by certain ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ ers &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ value at the beginning of the trial of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to lowering the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ ers below 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x every day compared to the treatment with standard doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ related study showed with regard to the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ age under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x every day compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ atal &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ age at &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and permanently keep away over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x every day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ atal &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functionality The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functionality ( i.e. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficiency rate at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the process of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aph@@ re@@ centr@@ ations at Pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe renal function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid @-@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l approximately 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of the open survey study on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) yiel@@ ded a decrease of the incidence of tox@@ ins at &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ ating shoe ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the cl@@ oned size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearing of the po@@ ds up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ IP values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients which received a long @-@ term treatment with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients , the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term investigation studies ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with healthy commission increased the maximum plastic concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plastic con@@ centric time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , larger than the dose @-@ proportionate increase .
after ing@@ esting simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x every day the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid bacteria , provided that has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking cans of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein@@ ment from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to al@@ min ) and is consistent over the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies at human@@ ic liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metals are primarily formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ute is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in urine was considered un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
besides the ex@@ cre@@ tion about urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure after taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency changed the C@@ max from feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to pro@@ gangs with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ ne@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ in h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ pos@@ orization and urine @-@ composition and for the clinical application as not relevant .
it has been noted that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , where the bones are brood @-@ resistant ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk exists for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ ting other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vitam@@ ins ) .
to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take early 30 minutes after taking the tablet , do not lie down .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately from each other in medicine used in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also resulted in a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to identify the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing the vitamin D @-@ mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took solely Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data which show that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose as specified in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE are accurate the dose which is required for the prevention of bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , ul@@ cers ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ( pu@@ zz@@ ards ) , tri@@ but@@ es ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) , as well as su@@ ction elev@@ ations .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ iger hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 , or one of the other components of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it should not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vitam@@ ins ) for the day .
the following critics are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day , which should take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , besides P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are only given in particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cor@@ ridors , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hosp@@ it@@ ement ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , and patients should be advised to put sor@@ cer@@ al pain or new or self @-@ lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe fatal side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is important to be given to the patient to be given to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk has been found , rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and associated complications , reports ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , commonly related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients , whose therapy regime contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to give the notes if the ab@@ uses a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment carried out by the patient doctor is decisive for therapeutic planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet into the next morning by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE if they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the resili@@ ence of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interest studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a wide range of usual medicines , without having split up relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not leave any indication directly on the damage to the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but it also reports on oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , the ser@@ um @-@ calcium took up to &lt; 8.5 mg / d@@ l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the attacks of the BM@@ D of spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ hil@@ ses and the entire body has been maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ ed studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily use of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new hurri@@ can@@ y@@ age at 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
resili@@ ence related to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the medium or@@ ale bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night@@ time and two hours before recording a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability took place in accordance with about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
oste@@ opor@@ os@@ estu@@ dio has been al@@ end@@ ron@@ at effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking of the day .
with healthy promot@@ ers , the Gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over 5 days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .

after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the renal Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance is not exceeding 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not passed on by rats or bas@@ ic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transportation systems .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should apply this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transplan@@ tation or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ or immuno@@ ass@@ esses .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage . modifications of the formulation or of the regime should only be made under the ti@@ ghter control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical device ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , needs a therapeutic surveillance and corresponding dose adap@@ tations to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ability and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching to Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f you should be controlled the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley in front of the conversion and over two weeks after switching .
on day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , compared with both form@@ ulations both at kidney and le@@ ased patients .
careful and repeti@@ tive checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sound levels are recommended during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate im@@ plant@@ ations phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dosage can take several days before the ste@@ ady State is reached .

duration of application Z@@ ur suppression of transplan@@ tion must be maintained according to immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dosage recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ transfers Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the Tran@@ splan@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift on the morning .
further can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the Tran@@ splan@@ la@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift on the morning .
dosage recommen@@ ding - conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be turned twice daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f so this conversion has in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants at Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily must start the treatment with the recommended and liver transplan@@ tation recommended for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tion .
heart transp@@ l@@ ant around adult patients who are revers@@ ed to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a oral Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once again .
other transp@@ l@@ ant receiver has no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f at pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ cre@@ atic and col@@ onic patients in a or@@ ical Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day , in a oral Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ ts at a oral Initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adap@@ tations in special care groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ tal@@ in in the nar@@ ro@@ ught area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced renal function because kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ as@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
switching of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ no@@ on to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ction and toler@@ ability in the single case involving whol@@ eh@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ k@@ lim@@ us checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sound levels during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood level mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the level of the level in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml does not exceed .
in clinical practice the talent levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the field of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and ad@@ renal - and hearty patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent acquisition of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood @-@ centr@@ ations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ tion@@ ists or other side @-@ effects which can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage . modifications of the formulation or of the regime should only be made under the ti@@ ghter control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ osing weight , which has been proven against other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapy @-@ resistant , are still not yet any clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vaginal formulation .
at the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transp@@ osing at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transp@@ osing at Kind@@ age there are not yet any clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ f .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a demo@@ tion of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ite mirror in the blood and a sha@@ ding of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements that cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood are offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , among pro@@ gra@@ f was referred to as Car@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia be@@ amed chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ ic , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and estrogen .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to suitable clothes or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for bru@@ es as headaches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual defects should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b - blood levels can change in the simultaneous transmission of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain more moderate concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic o@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV / eas@@ iness ( z .
pharmac@@ eu@@ kin@@ e@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulting from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism that results .
high @-@ weather pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute symptoms , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are down the Clear@@ ance of stero@@ ids contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormonal exposure , in decisions about recep@@ tive measures can be particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously .
the results of animal trials have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and leng@@ then their half @-@ time prolon@@ gs .
the results of a small number of tests on transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn effects is recommended for any damaging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .

Adv@@ ate is used in the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) , innate blood cl@@ inn@@ ation disorder .
dosage and incidence of application will be directed after whether Adv@@ ate is applied to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which an gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the creation of the human t@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is another in the European Union approved drug called re@@ ins , similar but is made differently , so the drug does not contain proteins and animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the drug application was examined for prevention of blood vessels as well as with surgical intervention .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ant@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ iso@@ forms with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are sw@@ ing@@ le , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human bar@@ rage factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ y or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approved for the promotion of Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the severity of the factor VIII Man@@ gels , after the place and the extent of blood pressure and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ of @-@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VIII activity should not sink under the specified plastic pi@@ per ( in % of the standard or in fact / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat that the risk for the patient is above .
during the treatment process , to control the dosage and the frequency of injections , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII and plastic waste is in@@ as@@ certain@@ ed .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value wid@@ ths .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis twin @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be separated from 20 to 40 by factor VIII per kilo@@ gram body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plastic activities are not reached or if the blood test is not dominated by appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to submit if necessary in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so other therapeutic interventions need to be raised .
the inj@@ ectable speed should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies against a factor VIII is a popular complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ic activity of a factor VIII Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma , with modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , which depends on the risk within the first 20 function stage and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expe@@ ditions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occur of ( lowest ) In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of the h@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole time and both the importance of the II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearing @-@ rate showed sufficient values at the 15th of post .

based on the information available since the initial marketing of all available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the filing was to apply for 5 years to request a further extension .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee for Human Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for approval for the marketing of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the female parts ( tissues , which connects other structures in the body , surrounds and draws it ) .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that it can wear an gene in the cells of the body .
when the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the tum@@ our cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , normally contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , with which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company placed data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of the basement , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents the CH@@ MP was issued on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore takes advantage for the patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ im can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not note the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ pl@@ ating Use program &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing active ingredient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so combined so that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , through an allergy to pol@@ len eman@@ ating inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ wor@@ ms ( clo@@ ckers nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and be ended as soon as the symptoms , above all the swelling of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um ( clo@@ th@@ ed nose ) are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ted to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective stri@@ ches were the changes of the severity of the ha@@ y fever , which were reported by the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients performed their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y fever , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , about a decrease of the symptoms at 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um was considered , the patients showed a relie@@ ving of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in the patient who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side @-@ effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ es ( heart disease ) , irritation , psych@@ omot@@ or , psych@@ osis , headaches , ti@@ redness , ti@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseudo @-@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( a different drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( higher blood pressure ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a risk of cereb@@ ral stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission published the European Commission SP Europe approval for the marketing of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole swal@@ low ( that is , without sh@@ atter or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data concerning the in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after termination of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take time with time .
by decline of the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper brea@@ ths , the treatment can be continued on demand with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ e contains , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , p@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ tiva , which are used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ell@@ ating Rhin@@ ologi@@ an ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , Ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Nap@@ haz@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ oline , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collection , and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed about that treatment on occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of Pal@@ pit@@ falls , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( like headaches or a rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be set .
in the treatment of the following patients groups will be advised to caution : • Pati@@ ents are treated with heart @-@ rhythm problems • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ inf@@ ant in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Blas@@ m@@ ell@@ itus or Bron@@ zes pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ologic testing as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent positive reactions to indicators for housing transactions or reduce to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plastic concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have been observed .
with the results of psych@@ omot@@ or testing , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with placebo ( regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme approved for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine &apos;s enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .

the un@@ thin@@ kable of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to a ben@@ om@@ atic , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to use machines .
symptoms may vary from a vill@@ i @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , diminished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pu@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid , and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ vision@@ ing cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ al cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the additive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks connected with flying .
controlled trials were observed in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ das or manifestations of a c@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall cor@@ es for Sympt@@ om@@ atics ( except nas@@ al s@@ lat@@ ted swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect , determined by the nose s@@ anders , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .

in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us at an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was following six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared with placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission adopted the SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet every day , with one or without a meal , for relie@@ ving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials at the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the existing disease process and can be re @-@ recorded after the sound of the symptoms and at their re @-@ occur .
in the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy treatment .
clinical @-@ related interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the same time intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ atic , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to use machines .
in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic jud@@ gements , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently modified side effects reported on the more common than with placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 teenage patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect headaches , these came up at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ subject study , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ vision@@ ing cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ al cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ors of the expression of the adhesive molecule on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ experts in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ at@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks connected with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , trou@@ gh and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ists allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ently allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ists allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as described by the overall cor@@ es of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tica , A@@ eri@@ us effectively prevents the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can become simpler pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine is a cau@@ tionary factor in all ancest@@ ral diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in goes beyond the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of j@@ add@@ les at the end of the first c@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients , who were not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study .
an improvement in the itch around more than 50 % has been observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growth significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variable .
in a pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , it was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant moti@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance inf@@ erior effect of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic jud@@ gements , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 years were questioned for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar to the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ experts in adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s Vacc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed to the Committee for Human Pharmac@@ euticals ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company receives its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov in the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to adults and elderly people for protection against flu which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could create against a strain of influenza virus , which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a influenza pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human being , because people do not have immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system re@@ alizes the parts contained in the vaccine as &quot; physically alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a flu virus of this pedi@@ ment faster to form antibodies .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane interface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) dis@@ connected , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this gives the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the Ac@@ quired Imm@@ une De@@ fici@@ ency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to inc@@ ur , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral medicines has taken before , and the likelihood is judged that the virus is to address the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , but may feel the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of infected infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults that were previously not treated with prot@@ esters .
this with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r boo@@ sted medicine A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken with 20@@ 6 adults , who had formerly taken prot@@ eas@@ ed prot@@ esters .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral last ) or changing the viral treatment after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ esting pat@@ ernity , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral last below 400 copies / ml than below placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the virus last but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ iness , but very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults , who had been treated previously with prot@@ eas@@ ed agents , the virus lowered to 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ esters :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ iness , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral last after four weeks as with the patients who took their previous protein eas@@ iness :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , bo@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and FA@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients requiring cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just as ather@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV consists of patients who occupy A@@ gener@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ystro@@ phy ( Ab@@ die of bone tissues ) or an immuno@@ deficiency syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of protein @-@ eas@@ ed patients and children over four years towards the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic amplifier , but the Committee established that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ed prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ested adults and children older than 4 years .
for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic boo@@ ths of am@@ bush can be administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral contrac@@ tion and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a solution to remove is 14 % less than by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying attri@@ tion of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses must be applied at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of in@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ esters were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ i 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements that contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plastic concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy , have increased risk for severe liver damage with potentially fatal course .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which is confused about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic coron@@ ary has passed the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ p and support of the ad@@ renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin for the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen was not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug concentration is available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plasma @-@ pi@@ gel of am@@ bush ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ bush , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ bush , patients should therefore be monitored upon o@@ il@@ at@@ ent@@ ations of symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propaganda solution of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mu@@ cos@@ as ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including demonstrators , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an expedition of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , their therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hä@@ m@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , that were treated with prot@@ eas@@ iness , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ atology .
with HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective cells can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune @-@ degree Index ) , cases cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ comp@@ ass , particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not simultaneously be associated with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ i 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines , whose ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ entment development .
in trying to offset the degra@@ ded plastic pipe by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wee@@ ds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking cur@@ rants , the am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror is and , if possible , to check the virus last and remove the cur@@ rants .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required , if Nel@@ sin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % degra@@ ded when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) used in combination with am@@ spec@@ k capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 m@@ g. are used twice a day and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this therapeutic schem@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) used in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) reached with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg TH@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dose of recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , but it is recommended as a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring as the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da down ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ bush in combination with am@@ bush ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein eas@@ ed is low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ esters and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ is sun@@ k into the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r possibly .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the diminished or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic waste .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ bush and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous transmission of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in the side of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin connected side @-@ effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage can be advised at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data .
pharmaceutical kin@@ e@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but could be increased the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of both medicine in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ s and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max by k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in comparison to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with ather@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines , if they are applied in combination with ather@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ esters , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as ather@@ ase , as it can come to resili@@ ent disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ tures known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ bush can lead to a degradation of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ block such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ dic@@ pin , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by am@@ bush , causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plastic concentration and ampli@@ fy with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhibit@@ ors in combination side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ kor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless that the potential benefits of treatment exceeds the risk of systemic coron@@ ary proportion to the effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose obj@@ ections is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are influenced by the ru@@ st@@ on@@ eness at simultaneous administration of in@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel@@ elevated elevated to this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not to be applied together with oral @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time applying amp@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am on caution .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ esting pat@@ ron@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma @-@ pi@@ ers from Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored upon o@@ il@@ at@@ ent@@ ations of symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the lower reliability of historical comparisons , no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous Gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not required , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of possible utility for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk fr@@ active rats have been proven am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , it is not known whether am@@ bush comes into humans into the mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study on dre@@ ad@@ ful rats , which was administered by the limit in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ tility and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
the uni@@ formity of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children 4 years of age in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , they were early and often led to the treatment regim@@ en .
many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned effects are derived from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients did not pre@@ treated 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( degree of 2 to 4 ) have been accepted by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as conducted laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ al and fast @-@ fat tissues , multip@@ ly in@@ trac@@ tive and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hia of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ cervi@@ cal fats .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ tive people who were treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine on a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only a case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 appeared at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ONS with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ VE 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ons have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral agent therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in case of PI @-@ treated patients , which received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ ated k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 3 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degree of 3 and 4 ) , which were among patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ ated k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently occurred .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is based on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies to initiate .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ or of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication with man is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ fitted non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were used - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ en with prot@@ esting pat@@ ors , the mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ kled avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to with prot@@ ested patients diagnosed in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ eas@@ ed mut@@ ations :
the prototype @-@ based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be applied to the evaluation of the activity of am@@ edi@@ viol@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ed @-@ res@@ istent isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ bush viol@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations to analyse the results of resistance tests .
in conjunction with the prototype @-@ based analyses Klin@@ ically vali@@ dated phenomenon @-@ based phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the evaluation of the activity of am@@ edi@@ viol@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
firms , selling diagnostic tests , have developed sound@@ ing @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a result testing .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated patterns generates a certain crus@@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ esters for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ s , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ s not pre@@ defined patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ ox / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ k@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ k@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the way round , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ esting @-@ resistant drug resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early break @-@ off of a prescribed therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which may affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice per day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( approximately 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly associated with lower k@@ oo@@ ge k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) people with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ submission of AP@@ V / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ fast@@ ly average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ estimate of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ baked A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ si@@ ated k@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optimization using PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ baked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with am@@ bush ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the scale and rate of resili@@ ence .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ har@@ dened penetration of am@@ bush in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ baked am@@ bush , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ baked am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component during the degree of doctor &apos;s degree in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ spec@@ k exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is out of solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of kidney function can be low on the elimination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ plastic boxes comparable to those that are obtained in healthy pro@@ gangs following a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bush avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male @-@ cell @-@ cell aden@@ omas with doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet recorded and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data at the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ linders were included in human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates .
so far , in clinical studies , no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the treatment .
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days demonstrated both in the control and with am@@ bush @-@ treated animals a high mor@@ t@@ ality .
in a systemic plastic exposure , the significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure among humans lay , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes observed , point out on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying attri@@ tion of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses must be applied at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is intended to be carried out with caution in patients with clever or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug concentration is available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be put on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mu@@ cos@@ as ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk to a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ entment development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % degra@@ ded when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) used in combination with am@@ spec@@ k capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) reached with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg TH@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dose of recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , but it is recommended as a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring as the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein eas@@ ed is low .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ bush and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there is no clinical data for this .
the ser@@ um concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ block such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ dic@@ pin , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ bush , causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous Gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or later .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation of possible utility for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on dre@@ ad@@ ful rats , which was administered by the limit in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , showed a diminished increase in the body weight while breastfeeding .
the uni@@ formity of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children 4 years of age in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is based on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies to initiate .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is found in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
the way round , Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ esting @-@ resistant drug resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data should be considered in the treatment optimization using PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ baked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ baked am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components during the Do@@ zation inter@@ v@@ alls as a result of the overall medical doctor in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of kidney disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ bush and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bush avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male @-@ cell @-@ cell aden@@ omas with doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to human beings after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ative aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and entertaining lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days demonstrated both in the control and with am@@ bush @-@ treated animals a high mor@@ t@@ ality .
these results can be ruled that in young people are not fully mature , so am@@ using avi@@ r or other critical parts of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ested adults and children older than 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; form &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for installation was neither claimed nor treated with the patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PI @-@ treated patients &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as a solution to remove is 14 % less than by Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to inhal@@ ing ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dosage recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inc@@ ur and low do@@ si@@ ated k@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patients could be avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ edi@@ ts , is an application of a gener@@ ase solution to inc@@ ite patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ ed content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inc@@ ision in children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can cause a com@@ promis@@ ingly inhibit@@ ing of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects , such as heart @-@ rhythm problems ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 an transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug concentration is available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be deduc@@ ed in duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mu@@ cos@@ as ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk to a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .

occasionally , some patients suffer from changes to the applic@@ ations@@ location ( blu@@ ff@@ ing , inflammation , wound @-@ formation , swelling , flu or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um , sti@@ ff@@ led nose , flu or flu @-@ like symptoms , redness , diar@@ rho@@ ea , redness , fac@@ ets , s@@ cour@@ sers , fever , weakness or bow@@ ed fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ d@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non@@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kane , g@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled and thus in most organs in the body accum@@ ulating and those damage .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , diminished lung , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor that possesses the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with recur@@ sive devices , and patients need appropriate medicines prior to administration , to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by examining his effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ ral@@ gi@@ as , pain pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , Hitler &apos;s feeling , fever and reactions to the fusion center .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen toler@@ ating ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and bow@@ ed fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Drugs Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to review all new information each year , which may possibly be known , examine and update this summary , if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patient who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as regards the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. Provi@@ ded approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative to the long @-@ term enzyme in patients with spot@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ d@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor that possesses the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in sol@@ ation can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients no substitute scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no substitute scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reactions which are defined as each associated side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should also be monitored in eng@@ masch@@ ige , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment , at the rehabilitation facilities available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients can form Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related response , must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
given little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically raised risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ars ) to treat the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be raised and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be seen .
in@@ fusion may be taken with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred , resum@@ ed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate , in which the pre @-@ made reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of larv@@ ae consists .
animal experimental studies do not let direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated across the breast milk , is recommended , is not recommended during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects in clinical trials have been assessed primarily as in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , there are severe reactions to , including bron@@ zz@@ pas@@ mus , breath still@@ ness and face @-@ face ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children &apos;s desired drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with overwhel@@ m@@ ingly severe decay form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
for most patients it came from 3 months after the start of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it occurred among patients in the age of 5 years with a severe decay form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were evaluated for 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ presses ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies , including 3 patients , where there was never too Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with absent from the low antibody level instruc@@ t a robust reduction in the g@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al to low neutral ease of inhibit@@ or activity on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro , which appeared not to prejudi@@ ce the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in relation to the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , even though the occurrence of undes@@ irable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate sub@@ strate and preventing a further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 phosph@@ or@@ us recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire patient spectrum was reported , the majority of patients were reported from the average phenomenon and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atorial volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - walking @-@ test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients over the placebo group improved an improvement in the lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability which is represented in the following table .
in the open extension case , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in der@@ d@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as the following table emerge .
the decrease of the previous percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volum@@ ina increased significantly propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ eg@@ aly on treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) that remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ genic effects of disease between patients , which comp@@ iles through the use of a combined end , the clin@@ ically significant normal FE@@ V , circuit in the 6 @-@ minute test test , movement of the shoulder @-@ organ ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ round phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy flow form and 4 with the medium term form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of the GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the res@@ in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) discovered following the Z @-@ Score for this age group called the younger patients with the average run form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average run @-@ form to determine a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe decay form were limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ es schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the nutritional scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks , the difficulties with weekly influenza versions , have a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two faculty schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in conjunction with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not been eliminated chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) has already become slightly different on other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell lung cancer , which does not take the turn@@ around epith@@ eli@@ um cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been dealt with , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens .
to decrease side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should before or after the Gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid lack of lack ) .
in patients whose blood image changes , or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , reduced or reduced the dose .
the active form of embarrassment re@@ bo@@ xed thus the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily than in healthy cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients , where cancer does not attack the turn@@ um cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the compar@@ ational medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle has to be applied with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from a cut @-@ bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % sodium injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic Bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ flowing epith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ o@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ unic@@ ated bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body @-@ surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al bron@@ chi@@ al chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin transactions the day must be given and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ars you need to be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also get a in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) within the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third turn @-@ operation cycle .
in patients which receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ genic census .
the al@@ kal@@ emia phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ ac@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a tin @-@ examination must take place under a gre@@ ening of the n@@ adi@@ r of blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient is worth the value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 Jah@@ an@@ um or compared to patients aged 65 years of age , increased risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ compromising and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment is necessary to go beyond the dosage customiz@@ ations recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients were examined with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ s and / or trans@@ ac@@ as@@ en@@ value of &gt; dem 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver carbohydrates ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) .
patients must be monitored with regard to the button of the button and can not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ sees a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ ro@@ ism has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutrality number , Th@@ ro@@ genic number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 shar@@ mat@@ ologic and ne@@ chth@@ on@@ mat@@ ologic toxicity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie und infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ wil@@ dered when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients need to be reli@@ ed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to apply intended toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non stero@@ idal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ ing 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ fle@@ wer@@ age should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients who played these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ inage in the trans@@ ference of the result in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed treatment can be raised .
5 severe cardi@@ o@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ inf@@ ant , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason the simultaneous use of atten@@ dan@@ ts ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is made , men should be pointed out before the treatment - should be advised to obtain advice on sper@@ mat@@ ozo@@ a .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) tall doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ c acid ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a decreased pl@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ous ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased effects of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ c acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and mind@@ ing - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since no data has been dis@@ crete regarding interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b must be the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the t@@ inn@@ y status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) if the decision has been taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aly in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ ent@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be used in pregnancy heavy birth defects .

the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are connected with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug by means the absorption of absorbed fats is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with a list of 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not invaluable ) .
the frequency of the known side @-@ effects caused by the listing of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a population of a population .
Q. It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli made in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects can lead to .
individual doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ subject doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered for normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without any significant clinical findings .
the majority of the reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ tization have either been reported either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals can be prec@@ eded from a fast re@@ formation of systemic effects that can be attributed to the modified properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect puts in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper part of the intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ ischen and pan@@ cre@@ atic liqu@@ or .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ al is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 can occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ al diet .
the primary parameter , the change in the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a percentage of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants , who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the weight loss of weight loss came up in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with a list of 60 mg -@@ 2,@@ 4 % ( initial 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with a list of 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output worth 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chemotherapy therapies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults whose chemotherapy regim@@ ens were , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
with chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are showed 59 % of the patients who were treated with al@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
with chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were at 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission was issued at Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer sickness and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting that induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy is ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given by chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty decre@@ es or signs of sub@@ acute id@@ le@@ us after the injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is recommended for the simultaneous Gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron with medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T @-@ interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which incl@@ ine to such an extension .
but in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeutic products , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days of chemotherapy neither for prevention nor for treating nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron is not the physical activity of five analysed chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e@@ al concentration of a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in a population based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous Gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ dic@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) has no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron .
experience to the use of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , hence , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the treating doctor .
in clinical trials these were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to watch adverse effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the meeting ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage showed itself similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events such as in the other do@@ ings groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , due to the large proportion volumes , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably no effective therapy at a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; 1.500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ c@@ eg@@ ram ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , given in day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to the 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron received , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
the results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out for 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. hang@@ ers in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ ad follows an initi@@ ale decrease of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average @-@ time limit of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentrations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in general throughout the tin area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dose @-@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses taken over 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ zin@@ om@@ pati@@ os between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
consisting of pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ e@@ tic sim@@ ulations that the overall prevalence of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron reached a total of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value in 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the introduction of 0.@@ 75 mg were higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated via the kidneys and some more 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent that I@@ so@@ da C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , about 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has made some 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting time in healthy , the total body of total was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale elimination rate and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate on the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ese channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the action potential .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( every dose ) spoke in about the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure to men ) which were given daily over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , ad@@ renal glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .
underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi are determined when people used to be unique , the relevance of these results will be low for the human being .

furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the drug .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C , which talked to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease in more patients back than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
aside from this , the test carried out in the study to examine the question , to what extent the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of appetite ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ in@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or cutting ) , sha@@ fts and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go will not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant kli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because aler@@ go against this type of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients aged 9 months from the age of nine , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
in case the patient does not appeal to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial cast@@ ings ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , produced in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was bot@@ tled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo languages on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment .
in these two studies however , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( failure @-@ filled tro@@ duction ) or infections that were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the order center .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go over@@ weigh the following superficial infection infections toward the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ clin@@ ations , sl@@ ats or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a licence for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two or three days will be investigated once more and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the sal@@ is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies at secondary and open wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin res@@ trained for@@ s@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected location occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the small plastic concentration , which have been achieved in humans after topical application on remot@@ ely skin or infected superficial wounds is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the current gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ographic application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the remote skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be held liable if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive damage after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the feder@@ ations / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in the gift of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
the decision whether the breastfeeding goes on / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial infection infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side effect irritation at the meeting place , which regarded about 1 % of patients .
effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Pi@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective Hem@@ p of bacterial protein synthesis using interaction on a certain ties of the 50@@ s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial fabrics .
data point out that the Bind@@ ing center ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and of the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ centre .
by attachment to this relationship , the P@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ or to the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking parts of P @-@ bind@@ ings @-@ interactions and avoid normal education of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection @-@ forms , should be pursued advice by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us found whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in the case of an un@@ speak@@ able reference to the treatment at S.@@ Au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viruses ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
re@@ taining In a study with healthy adult has been rated 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma was extracted .
the sampling occurred in the days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual systemic recording involving human being from 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ mal lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ors .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es became pri@@ mo@@ r by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under the lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id lesi@@ ons .

Ambi@@ rix is applied for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not yet im@@ mu@@ red against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of one of two cans , whereby one protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immuno@@ ass@@ ment consists of a low risk of Hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vaccination can be led from two doses to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; as it can defend against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the context of one of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients were some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibodies a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix run between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to the chs@@ men and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 out of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection body , redness , mat@@ ness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. for approval for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardization plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her has been desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ary vaccines or with a com@@ bin@@ ational vaccine .
the anti @-@ viral hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ary vaccines .
it is not yet completely guaranteed to be an immun@@ ologically competent person who addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her age as protection , as they are also protected by no more det@@ ectable antibodies may be protected by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injections , should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the drug use appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and supervision always available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the comp@@ at@@ ation@@ simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ ulate hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
in case of her@@ edi@@ atric patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances , no @-@ sufficient Anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies have reached , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ operative injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact results , these injections should be avoided .
in Th@@ ro@@ genic cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be in@@ quired for relatively sub@@ cut@@ aneous agents , since in these cases it can come to in@@ tra @-@ muscular source of blood .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in form of separate injection , tet@@ ra@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ular poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective genes , there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study involving 3 vacc@@ inations in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ity , Gast@@ ro@@ g@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants in the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ doses com@@ p .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and per@@ missions at a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis basis per person .
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the table observed , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the commission after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses com@@ bin@@ ational .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects reported that Ambi@@ rix had been given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the promot@@ ers , who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin @-@ combin@@ ant .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was comparable to pro @-@ band ( i.e. , over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects , which received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.5 % compared with the Pro@@ ban@@ den which received the 3 @-@ doses com@@ et compound ) .
the frequency of pre@@ defined pain and mer@@ it was low and comparable to that , which was observed after administration of the com@@ bin@@ ational vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year vaccines the appearance of loc@@ alized interactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses com@@ bin@@ ational HIV @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix has a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vaccines that reported on serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations with the com@@ bin@@ ational hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B , it was not different statisti@@ cally .
in clinical studies that were carried out at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study which was conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses were Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
at the 2@@ 89 people whose immuno@@ ass@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the Gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ a@@ es significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a com@@ bin@@ ational razor with 360 ELISA units form@@ ative hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccines .
the immune response from both anti@@ gens in this study was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simp@@ le@@ x , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ ative Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface was found in a tin volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , we could be demonstrated that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies must be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccines .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through bathing in through waste @-@ poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may possibly take a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with H@@ CV or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus in prior to the administration of both vaccination or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease infection .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those according to Hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin r@@ ashes , breathing or swelling of the face or the tongue . • If you have ever performed an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vaccination osis ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined H@@ CV / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ ative Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination osis of this vaccine with decreased content on effective ingredients is usually administered only one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against completion of the vaccine .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood@@ shed , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disorder or treatment in your body &apos;s own def@@ ences / or if you / your child will undergo a tick @-@ cataly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Sa@@ w your doctor if you / your child can take further medicines , ( including those who have received you without prescription ) or when you / your child has been vacc@@ inated ( antibodies ) , or if you / or your child has been administered ( antibodies ) , or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as diverse as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is intended to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not administered or nursing women , unless it is necessary that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other parts of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
equipment very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the sti@@ ch@@ hole or redness • reduc@@ tive • headaches • loss of appetite

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without any need@@ les .
based on the data that have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the transport sector , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits &apos; risk for Ambi@@ rix has been positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was limited only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of its small patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps may also be def@@ ective at the age of more than a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ä@@ ical En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain injury as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ tness ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is administered - split into several individual d@@ ins to meals - swal@@ lowed , taking the food mixed or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose son@@ de ( nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo ( a placebo medicine , that is , without a substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , a decrease in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid health or taste conversion , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , or weight gain .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract has been effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was authorized under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug has been submitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients with which a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ atic lack has already been manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ mani@@ um form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective , that manifes@@ ts himself after the first life period ) then there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ical En@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low pills or for patients with slip disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated with the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine app@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be administered in patients with ri@@ ffs , as a risk for the emergence of estrogen ho@@ gan@@ a is if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach .
any tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ carbonate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and eco @-@ formation .
since Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate should be carried out above the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous spo@@ ilers of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high d@@ osing ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to slow@@ down the neur@@ onal increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a hesit@@ ated matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients killed at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , in conjunction with Lak@@ e@@ azi@@ osis , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old child child with a sing@@ ular single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which included in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , which is neg@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is eliminated by the kidneys .
pol@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram , it is produced using sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve the survival chances and clinical results .
the prognosis of the premature ejaculation form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease carried out even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ ant @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life .
by her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium phen@@ yl and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of new@@ bor@@ ated at post@@ part@@ al ( but inside the first lifetime ) to diagnose 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and who were already treated before the initial occurrence of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ä@@ mic encephal@@ opathy , was the survival rates of 100 % , but even in those patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ mani@@ um form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oton@@ ous endom@@ etri@@ um and subsequently permanently with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ rac@@ ed diet , was the excess of 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are barely rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney en@@ matic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in a so@@ ber @-@ drug and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trial ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients by i@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were found 15 minutes after the intake measurable Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders or h@@ emo@@ ti@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) will be no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma on the next morning .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three sol@@ vent ) , in the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the applied product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who still do not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with hat@@ tan ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a or a nose son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ein@@ des in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ carbonate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if cr@@ atten@@ tions were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyram@@ idal cells of the brain .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , in conjunction with Lak@@ e@@ azi@@ osis , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
pol@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the elimination of excess accessories .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary tract can be assumed that for every grams of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ ates produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological deficits are barely rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after the intake measurable Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
with this action , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to get the medicine about a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may be dissolved before use in water ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body .
if with you conducted laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , flavours , im@@ perfec@@ tions of the hearing , dis@@ oriented , remin@@ ders , and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms in yourself , you can immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency relief of your hospital .

An@@ gi@@ an@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with instinc@@ tively Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ inf@@ ant ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ T Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent cl@@ ots in patients taking a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with anxiety or heart attack for maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox on all@@ ot@@ or @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different medicine compared to preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using he@@ par@@ in ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared .
while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the ass to prevent a sh@@ utter ) and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart accidents or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as yeast in terms of all indicators just as effective as he@@ et@@ in , except for serious bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ et@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ u@@ dine or any of the other components .
it must also not be used in patients who had recently been a bleeding , as well as in people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a reduction of infection .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an in@@ calcul@@ able replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary ar@@ im@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ he@@ iser ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) with an emergency or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended Initi@@ ald@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased by an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI , after clinical requirements the reduced In@@ fusion dose can be resum@@ ed by 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intraven@@ ous bol@@ dness of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h minimum for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ u@@ cle@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be given swiftly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 m@@ g. / kg should be inserted .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administered by 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT was worth 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also on di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous form of id@@ ated he@@ et@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous fund of low @-@ molecular yeast .
• better hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components or against brain cancer • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the tick @-@ system and / or irreversible bacterial cardi@@ tis . • heavy kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though in PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine the most blood @-@ ups occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation , can occur in patients who undergo a per@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients , the war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be considered to be a surveillance of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will be back the prior to treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ et@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ te@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood danger .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with th@@ rot@@ ary aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ st@@ ase parameters are regularly checked in each case .
the veterinary investigations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ miss@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in those treated with he@@ et@@ in @-@ treated groups , women in women as well as in patients over 65 years occurred more likely to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding came under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in groups with s@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dated plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intimate , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular bleeding or bleeding of a pun@@ cture , reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ational @-@ level of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood@@ stream , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alities that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ ar , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side @-@ effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in those treated with he@@ et@@ in @-@ treated groups , women in women as well as in patients over 65 years occurred more likely to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding came under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less often than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side @-@ effects which are not listed above were reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organ@@ ically ordered in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately deduc@@ ting and the patient eng@@ masch@@ ige must be monitored with regard to signs of a bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ ar inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the anim@@ e @-@ bind@@ ings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound up in the liquid phase or on t@@ inn@@ y .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is re@@ generated the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which allows the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes for treatment with insulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels ( sugar ) or the insulin or the insulin is eff@@ ected in in@@ effective manner .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human resources , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter operating time than a short @-@ effective human being .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body insulin is not working effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was reduced to 7.@@ 46 % compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human consumption .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect on blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for approval of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is defined as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the thi@@ ghs or the del@@ usion , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin delivery , the insulin may be imp@@ aired in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active force , the trademark , the insulin , the insulin , ( normal , N@@ PH , Gal@@ van@@ ishes , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method method can draw a change in insulin &apos;s needs .
3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and an anti@@ diabe@@ tic box ; these stat@@ uses are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching to a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in switching to the therapy schem@@ as .
to the substances , who can increase the blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fibro@@ us , flu@@ ox@@ etine inhibit@@ or , Pent@@ ano@@ f@@ yll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ h , se@@ ali@@ z@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ onic antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ renal c@@ anti@@ al regulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human beings in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not known whether insulin over@@ comes into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin occurs either in the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it resor@@ bed after oral application .
below are those from clinical trials known to those undes@@ irable drug response ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the availability of the dates can not be underestimated ) .

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Will fail to switch the injection inside of the injection range , can result in the sequence a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy to occur at the injection location .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with awareness can be treated by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by intraven@@ ous genes .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the pri@@ mor@@ dial cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as through the inhibit@@ or of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ stri@@ ve that occurs faster and the duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , the insulin @-@ range doses of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of dis@@ proportionate effect , and with 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose effects , just like human@@ eness .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has an twice as fast impact as normal human resources and achie@@ ves the full glucose effect of about 2 hours earlier than humanity .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable b@@ arian gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human consumption , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal in 2 minutes before the meal , the 2 minutes before the meal was used , which was 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commen@@ ced , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human consumption , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ances in front of the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human consumption , which was given 30 minutes ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human consumption , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - retro@@ fit ) after the start of the meal in comparison with human standards , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
