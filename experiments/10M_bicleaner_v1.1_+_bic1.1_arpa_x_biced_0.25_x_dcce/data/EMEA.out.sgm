<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Relations report (EPAR), which explains how the studies carried out by the Committee for Humanitarian (CHMP) has evaluated for recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">For more information about your illness or treatment, please refer to the Packages (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to incur (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Detres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not available), mistrust and inscription; • Bepolar disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patients suffer many episodes (periods abnormal high-mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe Manic episodes and in the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders, if the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can take the solution to the incision or the melting in patients may be used to prevent the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are exactly as bilify, should be adapted to the dose of bilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole mainly works as a "participatory" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripibuzole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, Aripibuzole carries to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-occur is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of bilify, the resisting of symptoms to prevent was investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of an injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been stabilized over twelve weeks to 347 patients with half-idol, in another study the effectiveness of bilify and placebo, taking recurrence patients, in which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with axify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of bilify injection moulding solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to severe anxiety, with which by Lorazepam (a different antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms experienced by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also resulted in studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melt-coated tablets and the solution to the incision (decreasing).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients, Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased unrest as the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify are more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previous patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of severe anxiety and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of bilify. (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappyramidal disorders, crushing, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping-dysfunctions, insomnia (sleeping-dysfunctions, insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate-heavy ones at bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes of treatment with Aripibuzole languages, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes at bipolar disorder, when a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission issued the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of bilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients shown that predominantly manic episodes had and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole languages (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or Combinational therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients should be considered a lower initialdosis if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the Combinational therapy, the Aripibuzole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior is part of psychotic disease and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicide risk with Aripibuzene in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardium), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony (stretching dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure receptor) or hypertension (including aczelted and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less digested, there were occasional reports of during treatment with Aripiprazoning Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at any one with ABILIFY, patients are signs of signs and symptoms of a late dysphinder, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripibuzole should be used in patients with scratches in the anamnesis or at states that are used with varicans in the context of caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripibuzole, a higher stery compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and the anus for unwanted disebrovascular events with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs, which allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gaining weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolarity mania, the application of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiotzole on the central system caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with itself overlagging side effects such as sedation is taken (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonis Famotidin, an gastric blocker, reduces the remains of Aripibuzole, but this effect is considered as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy commission increased a high-effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) the AUC of Aripibuzole around 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other high-effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians can result with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plastic concentration of Aripibuzole as compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common Gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV / Proteashibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After filing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiers concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data of safety in humans and due to the concerns of animal tempered concerns, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify clearly the potential risk to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, with other antipsychotic patients the patients should be warned against it, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study on 52 weeks, treated with Aripibuzole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, acathom, Dystonie and Dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with semi-operated dol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">Placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study, more than 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripibuzole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those among lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks on a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients suffering from Aripiers treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient-groups among Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory conditions arose, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatrophokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, have been observed at 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side-effects which can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about whose appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late uacic incidents and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, untreated or intentional overdosiations were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick-catalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripibuzole; it is unlikely, that tick-catalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is because Aripibuzole has a high plastic transmission.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder regarding the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor, and the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks on healthy proofed the positories of the bonds of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and in the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 hrined patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripibuzole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operdol-controlled trial, 52 per cent of the Resptive patients who held a response to the study medication, in both groups similar (Aripibuzole 77% and Halopdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of brass, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- anti-depressant scale, showed a significantly stronger bettering than with semiopidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks on stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the relapse rate showed at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an olanted-controlled, multinational double blind study at schizophrenia, more than 26 weeks, the 314 patients embraced and evaluated in the primary study patient (N = 18 or 13% of value patient benefit) in significant less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripibuzole showed a placebo over placebo over three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripibuzole showed no superior effectiveness to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripibuzole showed a comparison to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a consumer effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or holding dol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also reported a comparative proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like lithium or semi-operating dol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks do not appeal to Lithiprazole an superior effectiveness in reducing Manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial on 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission during a stabilisation phase before Randomation, primarily at the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in preventing a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the stretching and hydroxyination of Aripibuzole, the N-Dealkyination is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination of elimination over CYP2D6 over CYP2D6 and for approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians on CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical kinetics between male and female healthy promoters, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of pharmaceukinetics yielded no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic features of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharynprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spharness, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and canodulous potential the preclinical data have no special dangers to recognise for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects have been observed only in doses or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they are limited for clinical use only limited or no importance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a dose-dependent of renal glands (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchant drug) at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10ple the middle steadal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis of Man).</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity changes is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there has been no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikro-ingredient that promotes the gravitcation of the microtubules from the tube-indicative and stabilized the microtubules through inhibition of their landolyisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network which is essential for the vitational interaction and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well known that album conveys the transcyte osis of plasma components into the endothelet cells and in the context of in-vitro studies, has been proven that the presence of allitaxel promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is given by the gp-60-album receptor and is due to the albuzzling Proteins SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of myxane for metastatic Mamocarcinoma is supported by data of 106 patients in two invaried unused studies and 454 patients who were treated in randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree of patients, which were evaluated for a peripheral neuropathy grade 3, evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of the peripheral neuropathy for precipitation on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of abrasions after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and continues to be unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of myxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposure (AUC) raised a linear range of 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of myxane in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plastic concentration took on a multidisciplinary manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or pastoral transmission of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Paclitaxel were matched to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3-hour injecting of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the abrasive-sized Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was graft higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissues, it is reported that Paclitaxel primarily leads to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihyurxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2, the average value for cumulative urism of the unaltered ingredient of 4% of the given total dose was less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching Clearance Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same substance (also called "References").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood ferrous complications in which in connection with a blood transfusion complications might occur if prior to the procedure a self-bleeding is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to let their own blood flow, Absamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection may also be made by the patient or his supervisors, provided they have received adequate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deilite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are before the treatment to verify that no iron lack is made, and iron supplemental should be administered throughout the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients suffering from chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoial deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used in front of operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which an gene (DNA) was introduced, which makes it enabled for the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was treated with administration as an injection in a Vene as part of a main study with 479 patients who caused anaemia issues caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected for at least eight weeks Eprecx / Erypo in a Vene, before they were either pushed to seamed or continue Eprecx / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the hemoglobals between the beginning of the study and the period period between the weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of injected abseamed with those of Eprecx / Erypo were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study conducted with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinaries of patients were killed on the same degree as for those patients who continue to maintain Eprecx / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients continued to continue Eprecx / Erypo, a rise of 0.063 g / dl of the value value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steeping headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, since further studies are required to make sure this is triggered by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the drug has been undertaken according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprecx / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the Abseamed, is provided for medical professionals in all Member States information packages, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">August 2007 the European Commission granted Medice Drugs Pütter GmbH & Co KG for approval of seamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumors, malware lymphomas or multiplem Myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (Hämoglobin [HB] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no Iron Activity (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except in paediatric patients, where the hemoglobinate-zentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6,8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Anesthetic symptoms and follad can vary depending on age, gender and overall disease safety; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trial of disease and disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin um more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, occasionally a patient can occasionally be observed in a patient-gloombinaries about or under the hemoglobin- target-concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given these hemoglobariability, about an appropriate dosage management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobinant increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobell is worth 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored tighter to ensure that epoetin alfa is required in the lowest available dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anesthetic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with attached very low hB value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) possibly need higher yields than patients, where the initial anaemia is less heavily pronounced (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with attached very low hB value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) possibly need higher yields than patients, where the initial anaemia is less heavily pronounced (HB &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose is 50% / kg three times per week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose of a dose of 25 / kg (three times per week), until the desired goal is reached (this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have not demonstrated any significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epoetine, when the hemoglobinate concentration on the concentration of anesthetic symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions is increased.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobinant should be approximately 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidingly coronary heart disease illness or loss insufficiency should not be exceeded by the continuation of the hemoglobin target-point in Section 4.2-limit of the hemoglobin target.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most common side-effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of vascular vascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independently of the erythropoetin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated bloodshed on thrombogenic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="750">Acetone is applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another diabetes medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that can be used with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonic acid or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylharnosis or insulin can be maintained with the onset of action treatment except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulphonic harnosis or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body can be recycled into better and the blood sugar is reduced, causing type-2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acetylalanine was studied in triplea; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonic crop, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">The concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylified Hämoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were cut in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of an additional volume of action to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonic crop was reduced by 0.94%, while the additional goods of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of action and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took action in addition to insulin, lowering the hbA1c-values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who took addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory system (cold cuts), weight gain and mortar (diminished sensitivity to maturing).</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin or in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are no data available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) are to develop a decompression heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of stage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a heart failure, gaining weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardial Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a heart failure, gaining weight gain and oils, when pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>

<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports about heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased risk of liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used by Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="772">When the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3-fold the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is designed to point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, waitchessness and / or darker harn, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should continue, until the predict of the laboratory-arguments will be governed by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be stirred by fat deposits, and in some cases it is connected with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hereafter, under the therapy with Pioglitazone, a slight reduction of the mid-floor values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hmatokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in previous controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulphylharnum and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-3%) and the hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitivity in patients, the pioglitazone is made as oral or triple Combinational therapy with a sulphonic drug or as a specialist combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under treatment with thiazoldindian, including pioglitazone, reported on an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular dems with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular dems, although patients report about interference of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The charged fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women with pioglitazon women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patients years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, the fractures at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 questionnaires per 100 patients), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient-years) among patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is required (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digesoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reductasms are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with mixture fibrocide (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) result in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) result in a reduction of AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone reduced in pregnancy, increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the native substrates and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change of the gymnasors and the refracting indexes of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycemic ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT pins on the tripple of the high-border of the standard range frequently appears as below placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylharnates.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was around 1.6% higher than below placebo if pioglitazon or later.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction has rarely reported about insufficiency under Pioglitazone, however more frequently, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to bone brootics are randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with comparoglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients in communicating with comparatively treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro-active study, factions at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When the reported top dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator aceptor-g (PPAR-g)), resulting in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving pioglitazon versus Glicle cidal was continued for over two years to examine the time until the posture of the therapeutic effects (defined as hbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy, a blood sugar control could be maintained (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.5%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeboarding study of 12 months, patients, whose blood sugar was adjusted in spite of three imonatiger Optimization phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to only have insulin, a reduction in insulin or the group treated with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant reduction of the album / creatinin-quotient was shown as a comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monootherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) has been tested in a small, 18 week investigation into type-2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the overall triglypzeride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as insignificant, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced in comparison to placements, metformin or Gliclacide the total plasmasglycemeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placements, under Pioglitazone no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels have been found, while under metformin and Gliclacide reduced levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study conducted over 20 weeks of the Pioglitazone study, not only the sober-glyceride level, but also improved the high levels of triglycerides levels, this has an effect on the Triglypzeride absorption as well as on the imaging triglycemic synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular output study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application pioglitazone will quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentration on unaltered pioglitazone generally reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV provides effectiveness in approximately triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is quite pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In response studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digesoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) increases or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive markers pioglitazone, the marker was found mainly in the Fädel (55%) and to a lower scale in the resn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the overall active Metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazone and its Metabolites are smaller in patients with reduced renal function, whereby the rates of oral clearing in the native substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred at mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated administration, plasma-volume with hackable, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac spindy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon, reduced in the form of hyperinsulemia and increased insulin resistance of the womb and thereby diminishes the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the Rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of patients who took the adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patient, which took once daily 120 mg once daily, in the last three measurements a urinary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was at 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and in no one of the 134 patients in the case of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea (Nausea), rash and normal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients suffering from cardiac disease in pre-history may also affect an elevated risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in reducing the urinary tract in the blood more effective than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuritic disease in diseases that have already led to urine expires (including one out of the medical history known or currently present gassment and / or a gypsy).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serumharnaciers after 2-4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), can be considered a dosage increase at ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x every day.</seg>
<seg id="1182">For patients with severe kidney functionality, effectiveness and security were not completely investigated until now (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid a irritation of the esophagus, the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day, which should take early 30 minutes after taking the tablet, do not lie down.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and Vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in medicine used in the European Union, the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also resulted in a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to identify the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding increasing the vitamin D-mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients who were treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than those who took solely Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data which show that the Alendronate dose as specified in ADROVANCE are accurate the dose which is required for the prevention of bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side-effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of musculoskeletal (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system, constipation (flatulence), ulcers (Ulcera) of the esophagus (puzzards), tributes (blower abdomen), as well as suction elevations.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following critics are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of ösophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not crush the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera exists. • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day, which should take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract, besides Pyloroplasty, are only given in particular caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Öshageal reactions, such as Öshagitis, ösophageal Ulzera and ösophageal Erosions, rarely followed by ösophageal corridors, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly these severe and required a hospitement).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible solution-hageal irritation, and patients should be advised to put sorceral pain or new or self-limmering sodburn the medicine and get medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe fatal side-effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that refer to a ösophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is important to be given to the patient to be given to the patient and to be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large clinical studies with Alendronat no higher risk has been found, rarely (after market launch) stomach and duodenalulzera, among them some severe and associated complications, reports (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoporosis of the jaw, commonly related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients, whose therapy regime contains predominantly intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to give the notes if the abuses a bisphosphonattherapy in patients who need a kieffer surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteoporosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment carried out by the patient doctor is decisive for therapeutic planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet into the next morning by taking a dose of ADROVANCE if they have noticed their failure.</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate food and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplement, Antazida and some orale medicines may affect the resilience of Alendronat if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait after the intake of Alendronat least 30 minutes before they take other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interest studies have not been carried out, Alendronat was taken jointly with a wide range of usual medicines, without having split up relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by nursing women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate do not leave any indication directly on the damage to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoporosis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonate; most reports have been reported by cancer patients, but it also reports on osteoporosis patients.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that it can wear an gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When the virus in Advexin is a "adenovirus" that has changed so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the tumour cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed by the not defective in the human body existing p53-gene, normally contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, with which the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>

<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company on the questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents the CHMP was issued on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumore takes advantage for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexim can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, through an allergy to pollen emanating inflammation of the nose-way) in patients with nasal sworms (clockers nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and be ended as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose-endometrium (clothed nose) are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be tracted to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective striches were the changes of the severity of the hay fever, which were reported by the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients performed their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale, how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever, except the constipation of the nose, patients reported the aerinaze, about a decrease of the symptoms at 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-endometrium was considered, the patients showed a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% in the patient who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side-effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are Tachykares (heart disease), irritation, psychomotor, psychosis, headaches, tiredness, tisomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>

<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is in the whole swallow (that is, without shatter or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data concerning the inconsistency and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after termination of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take time with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">By decline of the swelling of the mucosas in the upper breaths, the treatment can be continued on demand with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephee contains, the drug is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity with other vasoconstrictors such as broocripitin, pergolid, pihydroergotamin or other decongestiva, which are used peroral or nasal as abellating Rhinologian (phenylpropanolamin, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Naphazoline, Naphazoline, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collection, and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address the corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about that treatment on occurrence of hypertension or a tachykarst or of Palpitfalls, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headaches or a reinforcement of headaches) must be set.</seg>

<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycopic.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unthinkable of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the incidence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans, and due to the vasoconstric properties of Pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be elucidated about it that in very rare cases it can come to a benomatic, which can lead to impairment of transportation or the ability to use machines.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed to the Committee for Human Pharmaceuticals (CHMP) officially that the company receives its application for approval of Aflunov in the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to adults and elderly people for protection against flu which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could create against a strain of influenza virus, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human being, because people do not have immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system realizes the parts contained in the vaccine as "physically alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a flu virus of this pediment faster to form antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane interface, which recognizes the human body as body alien) disconnected, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This gives the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for preventive vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for treating adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which are infected with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to incur, but this cannot be taken together with Ritteravir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">"" "" "" "Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked, which antiviral medicines has taken before, and the likelihood is judged that the virus is to address the drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, but may feel the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of infected infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritteravir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults that were previously not treated with protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosipped Ritteravir boosted medicine Agenerase has been taken with 206 adults, who had formerly taken proteased protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with undetectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral last) or changing the viral treatment after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protesting paternity, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral last below 400 copies / ml than below placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the virus last but with the children who had previously been treated with proteasiness, but very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, who had been treated previously with proteased agents, the virus lowered to 16-week treatment just as effective as other protesters:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasiness, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral last after four weeks as with the patients who took their previous protein easiness:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (flatulence), bosea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and FAgue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amspecavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients requiring currants (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines which are just as atherase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV consists of patients who occupy Agenerase (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonekystrophy (Abdie of bone tissues) or an immunodeficiency syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of protein-eased patients and children over four years towards the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier, but the Committee established that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had no proteased protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because at the time of approval for scientific reasons, only limited information occurs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Limited a licence for the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protested adults and children older than 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual, Agenerase capsules for pharmacokinetic booths of ambush can be administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amspecavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral contraction and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amstraavir as a solution to remove is 14% less than by Amstraavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Amstraavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying attrition of konavir (boosted), higher doses must be applied at Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amstraavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amspecavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety of ingenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protesters were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the failure of data for unobjectionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data the dose of Agenerase capsules for adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzi 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements that contain currants (hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plastic concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amspecavir during the intake of Amspecavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with atherase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usual, Agenerase capsules are used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral agent therapy, have increased risk for severe liver damage with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral agent therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which is confused about CYP3A4, it is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic coronary has passed the effects including Morbus Cusp and support of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin for the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen was not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards-Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration is available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to decreased plasma-pigel of ambush (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ambush, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills can be changed, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with ambush, patients should therefore be monitored upon oilatentations of symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propaganda solution of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mucosas (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including demonstrators, was reported via the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an expedition of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, their therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. Higher age, and with drug addicts factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hämophiles patients (type A and B), that were treated with proteasiness, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematome and hematology.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV infected patients with severe immune defective cells can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial aetiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune-degree Index), cases cases of osteonekcompass, particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral agent therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not simultaneously be associated with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzi 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritteravir must not be given together with medicines, whose ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are linked to the increased plasmaspiegel with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin a 82% reduction of AUC by Amspecavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resentment development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to offset the degraded plastic pipe by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with konavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskweeds (hypericum perforatum) The serum mirror of Amspecavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking currants, the amspecavirmirror is and, if possible, to check the virus last and remove the currants.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required, if Nelsinavir is administered together with amspecavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax by 30% degraded when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) used in combination with amspeck capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg. are used twice a day and konavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and inconsistency of this therapeutic schemas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) used in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinviolr + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) reached with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg THonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dose of recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amspecavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but it is recommended as a engmaschige monitoring as the effectiveness and unthinkable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosine, however, due to the fantasy component of Didanosine, is recommended that the revenue of Didanosine and Agenerase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida down).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambush in combination with ambush (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amspecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protein eased is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protesters and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapis sunk into the serumkonzentration of Amspecavir possibly.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the diminished or possibly subtherapeutic plastic waste.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of ambush and Ritonavir to Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous transmission of Amstraavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmakonzentration (AUC) from Rifabutin at 193% and thus to a rise in the side of rifabutin connected side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin can be administered together with Agenerase, a reduction in dosage can be advised at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical kinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but could be increased the plasmaspiegel of both medicine in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamspecs and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax by ketoconazole in comparison to the value, which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day without the simultaneous application of Fosamspecavir with konavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, can be applied together with atherase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines, if they are applied in combination with atherase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protesters, it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as atherase, as it can come to resilient disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvultures known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with ambush can lead to a degradation of the plasmaspiegel of Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calciumcanalblock such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, riodipin, nidicpin, nidicpin, nanodipin, and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by ambush, causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase its plastic concentration and amplify with PDE5-inhibitors in combination side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritteravir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonate intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden have been significantly increased, while the endogenous Kortisol rose by about 86% (90% Confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous Gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucokorticosteroids, unless that the potential benefits of treatment exceeds the risk of systemic coronary proportion to the effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose objections is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are influenced by the rustoneness at simultaneous administration of ingenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspiegelelevated elevated to this HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathia including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amspecavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization the mirror, since the Plasmakonzentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase is not to be applied together with oral-recorded midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time applying ampase with parenteral midazolam on caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protesting patronhibitors point to a possible increase in plasma-piers from Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored upon oilatentations of symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the lower reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, as the amspecavir- dose is to be adjusted if Amspecavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous Gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Standards-ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of the anti-thrombogenic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not required, therefore also alternative methods for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the simultaneous Gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliberation of possible utility for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk fractive rats have been proven amspecavir-related substances, it is not known whether ambush comes into humans into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on dreadful rats, which was administered by the limit in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period Amspecavir, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight in the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including Fertility and Reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Amstraavir to the mother-animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The uniformity of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children 4 years of age in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderate, they were early and often led to the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with the intake of Agenerase or any other at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned effects are derived from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients did not pretreated 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree of 2 to 4) have been accepted by the investigator as in connection with the study medication, and in more than 1% of patients were performed, as well as conducted laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral agent therapy has been associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fast-fat tissues, multiply intractive and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophia of breasts and dorsozercervical fats.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretrotive people who were treated with Amspecavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine on a medium duration of 36 weeks, was only a case (Stiernacking) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 appeared at 245 NRTIONS with 245 NRTIVE 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium term of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash were usually slightly to moderate, erythematic or makuda papulant nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be broken down with ambush.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekons have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral agent therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV infected patients with severe immune defective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In case of PI-treated patients, which received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dosiated konavir (grade 3 to 4) and lab changes (degree of 3 and 4), which were among patients who received Agenerase along with low dosiated konavir, very frequently occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose the patient is based on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supportive policies to initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amstraavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protections, thereby preventing the process of viral and gag-pol- polyproteination stages with the consequence of a formation of inmature, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amstraavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amstraavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm with acute cells and is 0.41 µm with chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amstraavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibitor of the HIV-1 replication with man is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretrofitted non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamspecavir / konavir dosages were used - as with other ritonavir treatment regimen with protesting pators, the mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the sixteen of 434 antiretrospective patients who received 700mg of Fosambush with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virologistic failure took place up to week 48, whereby 14 isolate genotypically could be investigated.</seg>

<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-11-algorithm for Fosambush violr / konavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / G, I62V and L90M, with Ritonavir as well as a decreased probability of a virological contact (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretations to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In conjunction with the prototype-based analyses Klinically validated phenomenon-based phenotypical interpretations can be applied in conjunction with the genotypical data for the evaluation of the activity of amediviolr / konavir / konavir / konavir in patients with protein-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Firms, selling diagnostic tests, have developed sounding-phenotypical Cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a result testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Amspecavir Associated patterns generates a certain crusresistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir but generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross resistance between amspecavir and other protesters for all 4 Fosamspecs, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On basis of twenty-five antiretrospecs not predefined patients, in which a Fosamavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), inox / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tikavir / Ritonavir (4 of 24 isolates) and Tikavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">The way round, Amstraavir reserves its activity against some other protesting-resistant drug resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early break-off of a prescribed therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits which may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritteravir 100 mg twice per day is based on the study PRO30017 (approximately 100 mg twice daily) and Nuclosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly associated with lower kooge konavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) people with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-submission of APV / konavir compared to the SOC-PI group with regard to the time-adfastly average (AAUCMB) in the Viruslast (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underestimate of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbaked Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-siated konavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amstraavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with ambush (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amspecavir with a meal leads to a 25% discount of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amstraavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady-state (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the scale and rate of resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unhardened penetration of ambush in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of unbaked ambush, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbaked amspecavir remains unchanged, the percentage of free active component during the degree of doctor's degree in the Steady-State on the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce CYP3A4 induce or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The Gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amspeck exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amspecavir is out of solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, hence the effect of kidney function can be low on the elimination of amspecavir and konavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to amspecavir-plastic boxes comparable to those that are obtained in healthy progangs following a dose of 1200 mg Amspecavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>

<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin can be administered together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although there is no clinical data for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calciumcanalblock such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, riodipin, nidicpin, nidicpin, nanodipin, and Verapamil can be increased by ambush, causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the Ritteravir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonate intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden have been significantly increased, while the endogenous Kortisol rose by about 86% (90% Confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In the simultaneous Gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Standards-ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of the anti-thrombogenic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease of AUC and Cmin by Amstraavir by 22% or later.</seg>

<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutral ease of inhibitor activity on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which appeared not to prejudice the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in relation to the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even though the occurrence of undesirable drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate substrate and preventing a further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into Lysosomes, most likely about Mannosis-6 phosphorus receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placecontrolled phase-3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy has to be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient is worth the value before treatment</seg>

<seg id="2596">A permanent weight reduction, for example by improving the diet and more exercise, the detox can prevent fatal diseases and has a positive impact on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients, and learn how to live permanently healthy.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilograms joule, which you can also find as a indication of the packaging of foods. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up a maximum of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Take note of the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Which amount is suitable for you, refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you. • Due to the effectiveness of the capsule is the adherence to the recommended fetters was decisive.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as previously, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By compliance with the recommended fetters, you can maximise weight reduction, and at the same time reduce the probability of nourished Beginning. • You should try to detect gradually and continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually, and continuously lose about 0,5 kg per week in weight, without frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "low levels of physical activity" means that you can work daily only little or no other physical activities. • "Middle physical activity" means that you walk through movement every day 150 kcal, e.g. by 3 km walking, 30- to 45-minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a permanent weight reduction, it is necessary to set up realistic calcium and fat targets and also adhere to it. • sensible is a nutritional book containing information about the calories- and fat content of your meals. • Imagining you to move more before starting with the uptake of alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli programme aimed at supporting weight reduction combined the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information materials, which can help you feed, kalorice and fetches and give guidelines, physically more active.</seg>
<seg id="2607">In conjunction with any type of cropped program to support weight loss, this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight.</seg>
<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemtherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like Cisplatin), as well as with chemotherapy therapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting are (like Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antipsychotic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies on 1 842 adults whose chemotherapy regimens were, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">With chemotherapy regimens, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 59% of the patients who were treated with alxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients with Ondansetron's patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapy regimens, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting are, showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were at 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission was issued at Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer sickness and for prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting that induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy is amplified by adding a corticosteroids given by chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the Dickdarmpassage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty decrees or signs of subacute idleus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is recommended for the simultaneous Gift of Palonosetron with medicines that prolongs the QT-interval or in patients where the Qt- interval is extended or which incline to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">But in connection with another chemotherapeutic products, Aloxi is supposed to be used in the days of chemotherapy neither for prevention nor for treating nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies inhibited Palonosetron is not the physical activity of five analysed chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonosetron and a steady stateal concentration of a CYP2D6-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous Gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Dexamethdicine, Cimetidin, Doxorubicin, fluitidine, chionavir, Sertralin and terbinafin) has no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, hence, Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is necessary by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials these were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to watch adverse effects (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly with alxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the meeting (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed itself similar frequencies of undesirable events such as in the other doings groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, due to the large proportion volumes, a dialysis probably no effective therapy at a aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2, Carboplatin, &lt; 1.500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcegram (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received, given in day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbaine as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron, with patients compared to the 32 mg Ondansetron received, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">The results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ventricular de- and repolarization involved in the ventricular channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out for 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.v. hangers in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous Gad follows an initiale decrease of the Plasmakonzentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average-time limit of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plastic concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentrations-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in general throughout the tin area of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses taken over 11 Hodenkarzinompatios between day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Consisting of pharmacokinetic simulations that the overall prevalence of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached a total of 0.75 mg of measured value in 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax after the introduction of 0.75 mg were higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated via the kidneys and some more 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have in comparison to Palonosetron about less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent that Isoda CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 is involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron has made some 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolting time in healthy, the total body of total was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale elimination rate and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron has increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate on the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Of preclinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of Ionese channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (every dose) spoke in about the 30s of the therapeutic exposure to men) which were given daily over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high dosages and da Aloxi are determined when people used to be unique, the relevance of these results will be low for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this approval for the transport sector needs to inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the drug in the context of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Pharmaceuticals (CHMP) adopted a negative value in which the approval of approval for the marketing of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of HCV 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon has a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same therapeutic practice that is already approved in the EU (also called "References").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-persistent) hepatitis C (a disease infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">A microscopic examination shows the liver tissue damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood-standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which an gene (DNA) was brought to which it inspires the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data which occupy the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredients, composition and purity of the drug, mode, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients suffering from hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon has been compared to the effectiveness of reference solutions to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured, how many patients were reported after 12 of total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment on the drug (i.e. no sign of virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been voiced that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C, which talked to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flamming the disease in more patients back than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test carried out in the study to examine the question, to what extent the medicine is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of appetite (one with crust formation) and small infected lainations (cracking or cutting), shafts and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo will not be used to treat infections that were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant klihylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alergo against this type of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients aged 9 months from the age of nine, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">In case the patient does not appeal to the treatment two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial castings (the parts of the bacterienzelle, produced in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was bottled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo languages on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response: when the results of both studies were taken together with Hautwunden, spoke about 90% of the patients of both groups on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies however, however, that Altargo was caused in the treatment of abscesses (failure-filled troduction) or infections that were detectable or presumably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order center.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo overweigh the following superficial infection infections toward the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small inclinations, slats or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Ltd. a licence for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two or three days will be investigated once more and an alternative therapy can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation through the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the salis carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies at secondary and open wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin restrained forscoccus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected location occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of reapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plastic concentration, which have been achieved in humans after topical application on remotely skin or infected superficial wounds is a clinically relevant imitation in vivo not to expect (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the current gift of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the average reapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topographic application of 1% reapamulin Salbe on the remote skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be held liable if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive damage after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the federations / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clearly indicative and the application of retapamulin in the gift of a systemic antibiotic is preferable.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding goes on / ended or the therapy with Altargo continued / ended, is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial infection infections, the altargo was applied, the most frequently reported side effect irritation at the meeting place, which regarded about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Piurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective Hemp of bacterial protein synthesis using interaction on a certain ties of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differ from the ties of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Binding center ribosomales Protein L3 involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-ties and of the Peptidyltransferasezcentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this relationship, the Puromutiline inhibitor to the Peptidyltransfer, blocking parts of P-bindings-interactions and avoid normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infection-forms, should be pursued advice by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus found whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of an unspeakable reference to the treatment at S.Aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viruses (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Retaining In a study with healthy adult has been rated 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion on intact skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma was extracted.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling occurred in the days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording involving human being from 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-mal lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes became primor by CYP3A4, under the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on genomation and / or chromosomale effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood cells, as well as in the rats microkernel test for the In-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither in male nor in female rats of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, causing an up to 5 times higher exposure was reached as the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 on 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryo study on rats were observed at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternale toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the transport must make sure that a pharmaceutical company is present in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) and works before the product will be marketed and as long as the market is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the marketing obligation to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical companies, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and included all additional updates of the RMP, which will be agreed with the CHMP.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not yet immured against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of one of two cans, whereby one protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when the immunoassment consists of a low risk of Hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vaccination can be led from two doses to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is required against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body) "as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered in the context of one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients were some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults, also as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibodies a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix run between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection of the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to the chsmen and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 out of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection body, redness, matness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. for approval for the transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for Grundimmunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher has been desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovary vaccines or with a combinational vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-viral hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovary vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely guaranteed to be an immunologically competent person who addressed to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher age as protection, as they are also protected by no more detectable antibodies may be protected by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the drug use appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and supervision always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the compatationsimple, the 360 ELISA units formulate hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of herediatric patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, under certain circumstances, no-sufficient Anti-HAV- and Anti-hbs antibodies have reached, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoperative injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact results, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In Throgenic cytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be inquired for relatively subcutaneous agents, since in these cases it can come to intra-muscular source of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year in form of separate injection, tetraus-, acular poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- Mumps-rubella vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective genes, there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study involving 3 vaccinations in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matity, Gastrogeritis, headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thiomersal- and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants in the age of 12 to including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix has been compared with the 3-doses comp.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and permissions at a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambirix, but not on a basis basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the Gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the table observed, compared to 39.1% in the commission after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinational.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects reported that Ambirix had been given, over pain, compared to 63.8% among the promoters, who have been vaccinated with the 3-tin-combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable to pro-band (i.e., over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, which received Ambirix, compared with 36.5% compared with the Probanden which received the 3-doses comet compound).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of predefined pain and merit was low and comparable to that, which was observed after administration of the combinational vaccine with the 3-doses vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- until 11-year vaccines the appearance of localized interactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that in administration with the 3-doses combinational HIV-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- until 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix has a frequent appearance of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported on serious side-effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccinations with the combinational hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B, it was not different statistically.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversions for anti-hbs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">At the 289 people whose immunoassity was worthless, the Seroproteection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the Gift of the 3-Dosenimpfaes significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1- until 11-year-old a month after ending the full vaccine (i.e., month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combinational razor with 360 ELISA units formative hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of prioritisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response from both antigens in this study was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simplex, consisting of 360 ELISA units formative Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface was found in a tin volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- until including 15-year-olds, we could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies must be compared 24 months after immunisation in 0-6- months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the refreshes of a combined diphthie-, tactial poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or using the first dose of a combined Masculosis vaccine administered.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as diverse as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is intended to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without any needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have been known since the issuance of the first approval for the transport sector, the CHMP opinion that the benefits' risk for Ambirix has been positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was limited only in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of its small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps may also be defective at the age of more than a month with incomplete Enzymective or with hyperammonäical Encephalopathy (brain injury as a result of high ammoniactness) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is administered - split into several individual dins to meals - swallowed, taking the food mixed or via a Gastrostoma (through the abdomen in the stomach of leading hose) or a nose sonde (nose into the stomach's leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo (a placebo medicine, that is, without a substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to loss of appetite, a decrease in blood, depression, irritability, headaches, fainting, fluid health or taste conversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urinary tract has been effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was authorized under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug has been submitted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicative in all patients with which a complete enzymatic lack has already been manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manimanium form (incomplete Enzymective, that manifests himself after the first life period) then there is an indication for the use when in the Anamnese is a hyperammonical Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow pills or for patients with slip disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated with the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose Natriumphenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifeste lack of carbylphosphate or ornithintranscarbylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine appuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS pills may not be administered in patients with riffs, as a risk for the emergence of estrogen hogana is if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Any tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polycarbonate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and eco-formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate should be carried out above the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous spoilers of phenylacetate on young rats in high dosing (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to slowdown the neuronal increase and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a hesitated maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is eliminated by humans into the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients killed at least an undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anormal patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy, in conjunction with Lakeaziosis, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred at a 5 month old child child with a singular single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which included in a intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is negated by acetylation with glutamine and phenylacetylglutamine which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Polylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the uretic cycle can be assumed that for each gram, it is produced using sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve the survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the premature ejaculation form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infant, and the disease carried out even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stickant-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>

<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and who were already treated before the initial occurrence of hyperammonämic encephalopathy, was the survival rates of 100%, but even in those patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manimanium form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygots form of the ornithintranscarbylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonotonous endometrium and subsequently permanently with sodium phenyl butyrate and a protraced diet, was the excess of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are barely reversible, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is produced in liver and kidney enmatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its Metabolites in plasma and urine were measured after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in a sober-drug and with liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trial).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its Metabolites was also examined in cancer patients by iriumphenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form were found 15 minutes after the intake measurable Plasmakonzentration of phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary disorders or hemotiopathies, according to different doses phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) will be no phenylacetate in plasma on the next morning.</seg>

<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary tract can be assumed that for every grams of biased sodium phenylates produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are barely reversible, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>

<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission issued The Medicines Company UK Ltd a permit for the transport of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary arimmen (instabile Angina / non-heiser) (IA / NSTEMI) with an emergency or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended Initialdosis of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another episode, an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased by an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After PCI, after clinical requirements the reduced Infusion dose can be resumed by 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolting of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of Rhinoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initials intravenous boldness of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h minimum for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allucleus gift by Angiox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt from 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolusdosis will be given swiftly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney functionality (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg. / kg should be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second Bolusdosis is administered by 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis will be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval III- PCI-study (Replace-2), which were included in the phase III- PCI-trial (Replace-2), the ACT was worth 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus without a dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also on dialysis patients is contraindicated (see below section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous form of idated heetin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous fund of low-molecular yeast.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• better hypersensitivity to the substance or any other components or against brain cancer • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of the tick-system and / or irreversible bacterial carditis. • heavy kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in PCI patients under Bivalirudine the most blood-ups occur at arterial punctuation, can occur in patients who undergo a perutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients, the warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine should be considered to be a surveillance of the INR value (International Standards-Ratio) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bivalirudine will be back the prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heetin, warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombozyteemmer) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood danger.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes for treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels (sugar) or the insulin or the insulin is effected in ineffective manner.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human resources, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter operating time than a short-effective human being.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, where the body insulin is not working effectively, Apidra was investigated in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosyllified Hämoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% was reduced to 7.46% compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect on blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approval of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is defined as subcutaneous injecting either in the area of the abdomen, the thighs or the delusion, or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin delivery, the insulin may be impaired in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the trademark, the insulin, the insulin, (normal, NPH, Galvanishes, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method method can draw a change in insulin's needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or the interruption of a treatment, in particular in patients with a insulin-based diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and an antidiabetic box; these statuses are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching to a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in switching to the therapy schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances, who can increase the blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemic, include oral antidiabetic, fibrous, fluoxetine inhibitor, Pentanofylline, propoxyph, sealizates and sulphonic antibiotics.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaembodies with awareness can be treated by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person or treated by a doctor by intravenous genes.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primordial cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as through the inhibitor of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous gastrive that occurs faster and the duration is shorter than in hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, the insulin-range doses of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of disproportionate effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucose effects, just like humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has an twice as fast impact as normal human resources and achieves the full glucose effect of about 2 hours earlier than humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable barian glycaemic control is achieved, as with human consumption, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal in 2 minutes before the meal, the 2 minutes before the meal was used, which was 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commenced, a comparable glycaemic control is given as with human consumption, which is given 2 Mi- nuances in front of the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal in comparison to human consumption, which was given 30 minutes (figure 1A) as well as compared to human consumption, which was 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
