machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ page itself , where you can insert the texts directly .
package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by doing this more easily accessible .
more information on the use of &amp; C@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ extensions .... open the selection tab tools and choose the desired modules there .
this is a list of default modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are installed if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; then click on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , if available , delete .
the Analytics module ( also called folder filter ) can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to display the DO@@ M construction in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; use extras DO@@ M tree to display ... and therefore open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : the element , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this throw @-@ drawing .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbolic and text views to make the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; it consists to graphi@@ ate folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rec@@ tan@@ gle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily be recognized , if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX operating system .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ at@@ ype presentation , a rec@@ tan@@ gle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , the right corner contains meaningful color @-@ related and sign@@ age settings .
the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched on view color mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the screw @-@ tone , or figure of a different file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different qualities of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify , if enough space is available for representation , or if the area of sub@@ ordinate rectangular configurations is to be used ( whereby thus , display error by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ at occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tan@@ gle .
when designing algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps should generally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item . during the Tre@@ at@@ ine &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always observed . there will be a frame that is no longer available for inser@@ ting entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square .
like distribution of an area of an agreement for sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains left to the end . here it is designed for the marking and avoiding the space loss due to getting beneficial the surfaces that are as square . the best methods on this matter are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second @-@ line .
you can specify the minimal presented surface for an entry on the menu entry in the area . instead a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the super@@ ordinate item , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera place will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly into &amp; publication . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of library g@@ ore 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ner ; together .
&amp; Breakfast came ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editor . you can use them to review and correct your photos , review and correct . the editing skills can be easily expanded with KDE image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it provides de@@ pl@@ ating professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color @-@ space and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ts by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ Content Management - Work@@ flow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg , about the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end of the end user . they therefore should report problems and improvements .
&amp; nbsp ; tries to make any problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu provides an entry problems or wishes . this opens a dialog with an under@@ stated short@@ cut . all required information is already listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; nbsp ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developers joined each other . if you wish to join a regular user of view , then we would like to answer any questions of other users . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be spoken in English , so you should be so powerful .
you can also check out the publication ; go to news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to get in &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate in is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list of &amp; publication ; .
when you come and start ; for the first time , you are asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . here you can select a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder folder folder , to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , data records will be stored . this path will remain the same for all sub@@ folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ came ; you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . setting digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as base folder . no picture is changed . during the break@@ up of the folder you &apos;ll get a progression like this :
&amp; Ds returned to cur@@ vy the library path across its complete depth . you can choose no sub@@ folders , unless it came up in pet@@ alled folder . you can insert them in a pet@@ alled folder . you can insert it in a hidden folder . you can insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as the base folder , you will notice that the albums are not allowed to use photos as symbols . you can change that by clicking any photo from the album and take it on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an album symbol . further details can be found in the albums .
once you configure the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also use it . the support is based on the li@@ f@@ W library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ era@@ ise .
how you set up this and work with rough files is described in paragrap@@ hs Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera place will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly into &amp; publication . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of library g@@ ore 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ner ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transfer to the machine , the camera appears as USB mass storage device . the connection may also be implemented via the picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; nbsp ; uses the program g@@ Photo 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images of digital cameras to machines and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are big files and transfers to the serial port , this connection has become obsol@@ ete . it supports these cameras and guides the transmission of the pictures with g@@ Photo 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ ore 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the thumb@@ nail will be read from some li@@ b@@ g@@ ative 2 cam@@ er@@ ers . if the EX@@ IF @-@ support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ ative 2 , you might notice thumb@@ nail or the generation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to go on , is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the KDE Image plugin Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wers and G@@ wen@@ view develop . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics apps . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as there is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in and checking out ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
you can drag and disc@@ ard images anywhere : you can disc@@ ard one image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal separ@@ ator line or another application window . the only restriction is that one image does not appear in keywords , date list or search .
- a date selection allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are displayed in the tool@@ panel . thus the filters in the fil@@ en@@ ames will only be displayed in the fil@@ en@@ ame only when that ind the symbol symbol@@ ise . which fields are displayed , you can set in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides a organized view of your photo@@ sets . these albums are stored in a single album tree . these albums are stored in a single album tree , in which they were stored on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks or after the date when the album was first created . the date may be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ported images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to one album . select album Im@@ por@@ e scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another , move or move the photo with the mouse on the target album and move it . in the same way you will need to select whether the picture moves or copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to access information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click on the album right click on the album and edit the right @-@ click menu properties .
Albu@@ quer@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to select your albums so you can select or delete your photos by your collection . if you want to add or delete new collections using your collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons , older , average , new nests : these put the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average speed of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first entered an album and checking , the first image is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album click . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be scr@@ apped .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window introduces you to the top view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time you need to just wait while the thumb@@ nail pictures are generated . you can avoid in which you are using extras to generate all the thumb@@ nail pictures .
information about each image will appear below the file preview . what information is this , you can change over settings . select here the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have the help of the window . if you let the mouse @-@ cursor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot is shown above in the paragraph introduction to the main window shows such aid window .
photos are all , what it comes with &amp; checking , comes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can view all the features presented with &amp; checking . you can reach all the features presented with &amp; checking . you can choose between the viewing of images , a slides or the processing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image ... or select the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and edit ... selecting the picture editing you can edit your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality they need not provide you . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button . the applications listed there are checked by the &amp; k@@ de ; file parameters for the file type is checked , and how you are not enumer@@ ated to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image processing programs you can get to problems with the metadata present in the picture . some programs do not store this data with , if you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ tization ; two choices are available for spin . the easiest way to click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to select and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ menu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep enlargement ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
when you came to a photo of &amp; Lock ; delete , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; f@@ 8 image dele@@ tion or de@@ f Falls you prefer to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Dis@@ f using .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My dates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View ; organising your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; nbsp ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select a month out of the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et down in the date view , so that you will only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with key@@ word features a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and kat@@ alogue . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to the individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all the photos taken with this key@@ word is indicated .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords logical . you can also sum parts of the Bau@@ ms &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; comp@@ ass , so that you can find the keywords which you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and access key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords will re @-@ imported into other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ came ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or to add new key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is the symbol of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keywords will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put on it . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to postp@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the name of the word and the symbol in the tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album click . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to view &amp; nbsp ; s functionality provided with keywords , you must first select your photos with key@@ word : once you choose the photos , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; drag and place there . alternatively , you can click on the thumb@@ nails of the images and choose from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords preferences . in this way you can pick a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can right click the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ o@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can click over this hist@@ o@@ gram . in order to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ tan@@ gle of the drop @-@ frame which displays the time@@ frame . thus , all associated pictures are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , disks and in the future are even more .
Neb@@ uch@@ er Search is a small lamp the Green will find when the search results . if you click here , the filter is deleted and all images are shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . you can save this search here but as a live search that always fil@@ tered the fil@@ tered what you typ@@ ed as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved , he was Filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is carried out . the results are used in the view My search list displayed in the main window . if you want to change your choice after searching once again , you only need to select the appropriate entry for my search list and select an option in his context menu .

if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search button in the context menu .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , by which you can search for certain fields of &amp; publication ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option may add or delete it . any option may connect to others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ at ... link . furthermore , you can create Search of Type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ UR@@ quot ; create .
&amp; nbsp ; character@@ ize every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they match them . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to a similar . by means of a swelling can change the result selections , or shr@@ inks . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a fast sketch and checking ; find the matching pictures . here too , a s@@ ell@@ ings can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature . you can press with the mouse wheel or run zo@@ oming . move it while you drag the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . obviously , this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a Live ge@@ o @-@ folder .
&amp; nbsp ; put a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ tic add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open the window . if you are back in the studio window , you can open the illumin@@ ator fast with L extras .
out of the thumb@@ nail , you can compare the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you can preview the copy of which copy in which window size is to be seen . if you can preview cookies from the tool@@ bar and perform the zoo or differences . you can also compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to adjust quickly from a picture series . if you use p@@ air@@ wise , then use the left mouse button in any preview to display it in the left . this simplified picture is displayed in the right area . this simplified it by a number of similar pictures to work through .
of course , the normal holes are also possible directly from the lumin@@ aire , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the bul@@ b . for example , it makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in lock function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to drag the visible area of the picture , you must click them and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode , then both images are displayed in the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as it works in other views . simply use the z@@ oom regul@@ ator under pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to enter into the image and to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory - away from the fashion market ? digital inventory considers every part of the process which was taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos took up , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , use , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , convert , group@@ ing , secure , optimize , wait and export of images .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , transforming , trans@@ acted and exports content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata are defined as data about data . metadata are provided in accordance with your definition data , information on or documentation provided by other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no inventory no longer a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will not use &amp; digi@@ tization ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database as well as in image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you need to maintain anything inside your system . you need to decide whether other access to your photos do not want to store them on a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; notice that you will have to switch back to a larger drive sometime .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your memory location . if you were able to organize some photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders like &amp; eg , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 01 .
professional photographers have different requirements such as sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work processes , constant intake of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files , and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ ack@@ et easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the Met@@ adata option to activate in the site page of metadata in &amp; Check . this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what to change ? to do this , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you now need to assign any photo words , let@@ tering and assessment . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start doing the best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos .
let us now use key@@ word , key@@ word , as you are often called hot , or categories on other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it is no problem and can simply insert the pictures in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by using a sub@@ tree on another . the modified keywords will be followed by &amp; Lock ; updated while the sub@@ trees were persecuted .
the graph shows how different metadata alter@@ ing it . this is a very gross representation , since each block of metadata is made in truth from many sections . data stream and calendar data are properties of all images .
the keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want most anyone to just see your photos only , you want them to share with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . the let@@ tering has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the moti@@ f you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is ok if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself .
with &amp; checking , you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ ri@@ fication . you can even export it for a selection of pictures , then these sign@@ posts are exported to your wishes into the let@@ tering and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . therefore , you need to tell the story for the dup@@ lication no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train de@@ cks the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innumerable and will be deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future you can open your journeys through images with geographical references . however , this can also export the photos at the entrance site . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the google@@ maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a vocabulary with copyright and refers to the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all the changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; publication ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization . after which this value was saved , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author@@ itative title ( syn@@ onym for publisher ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this field must be filled in well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider in order to identify who the photo offers . if the photographer does not necessarily work the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Re@@ uters , or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic metadata , delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is essential for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and holding professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ marks is unique per image . and digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for st@@ ack@@ et processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that you can happen in traditional paper images or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data creation company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss .
to tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more difficult and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your surve@@ ying room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disco@@ s and good recording devices . the best DVD shooting devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it &apos;s about the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to error , even if you were just written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there are a more favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to have works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disk , hard@@ disks , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to gain the For@@ mat@@ ch@@ War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly h@@ exag@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
slowly burn out the media with a good reception on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . also , you can copy the media using a description , date &amp; author Kenn@@ y and then stored on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers reserve your stat@@ s for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s products include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ fault study
in short , Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error message , SM@@ ART cannot notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART errors will notice the immediate forthcoming case . these are particularly readers and publishing orders . expected life @-@ time amounts to between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss of power due to over@@ voltage . of course , you may also have data loss due to an electric blackout before you have saved the files , but these losses usually can be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices does not account much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processor . these can cause serious damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause hardware , hardware replacement , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the in@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by a part of the energy storage . it is usually available in the form of a St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar . remember , however , that not any p@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful that it provides protection against ligh@@ tening and thus protects the properly attached devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your machine , you should be sure that also all per@@ peri@@ pher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable @-@ de@@ ms and the TV map .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an accident of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a sub@@ br@@ ittle free power supply .
besides the protection from over@@ voltage tests , these devices can automatically provide cordless power if a power out@@ age occurs . if you buy a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concern yourself the potential risk that your machine system is exposed and compare its security in electricity disorders with the costs of avoiding this . a high quality maintenance protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider getting all the cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Windows , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to the HD@@ Ds but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general secure solution . for this it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more unlimited memory , in case of Flickr dramatic more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed store . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integr@@ ability between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred . all of these disorders remain un@@ detected until you have no protection to it . nobody seems to have thought of it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses , since they generate interference within the data currents . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors will remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle records on lower level and can be scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechan@@ isms that are used and is available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not a part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . at not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the meth@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage than theft or new installations ; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sighted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dened fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ending settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for comp@@ ac@@ t@@ cameras and the end result are the optimum for comp@@ ac@@ t@@ cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; thus , do not make anyone else for data loss . thus , you can make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make something more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates , or the size of hard disk drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on a remote flash drive . if , then one day , a flash strike , you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget airplane @-@ che@@ ek@@ e : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house .
hence , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention does not mean a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as it is said above is one more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files backed up to be backed up . it is a snapshot of no history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential assurance : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of up to two periods : that of the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates several moments . you can restore the original status at any time with such a backup . this backup comes with a locking system the next one with the exception that it is only dis@@ continued and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ scripts copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to re@@ discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of each month . each more di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete check .
topics : metadata , stored in image file stored IP@@ TC information , association X@@ MP files , original reserve , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future due to your nature is unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than having a certain guard . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than having a certain guard . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the statements made in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for anyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this is actually always growing .
let &apos;s take a look that you have entered the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; water ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of iron if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was created as an open source standard developed by the G@@ IF . it can save a lot more . it &apos;s loss free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF required and a slow comm@@ ited application . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , with some cameras you can store your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adjusted by many people . there are therefore over 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open pipe format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nik@@ on it even sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 to replace Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; - a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . file information will be included with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archives a original of your recording , mostly in the rough format . X@@ MP fits , since the metadata changes separately from the image file . therefore , you should think if you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , which includes a large area of operational purposes and business models . in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to reach a broader acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera e@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a refin@@ ing processing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; checking , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eria , co@@ vert in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking . in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description , as you have photos that you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . some cameras will appear for a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file size is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal metadata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . of the picture . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar , from the main window of &amp; publication ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from her camera into a single album in &amp; publication ; at downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend that the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired options using the default options of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download it . the button selected will be checked until you have selected some photos .
when your camera is supported , an option new download is available . these pictures were not downloaded from &amp; Lock . in this case , the new pictures have been marked with a star in advance showcase . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the buttons All download or choose selected , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed , like normal folder , displayed in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and then press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the pictures from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the button Dele@@ te . if you only want to delete some , then you must select it first and use the delete selected .
note that there are no possibility of taking photos that you deleted from the camera . so they should be checked carefully if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera , you should do this via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras are often not used as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photographs . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ activated once you load photos of different f@@ ables in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the picture and for dat@@ as @-@ based under@@ score . if you use this latter option , a folder per day is automatically created .
the options after transfer opens three more options , which are carried out before the pictures are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data on the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another medium format than standard format , you can for example use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % M : % M . place the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command stran@@ gle@@ time .
when you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or if you prefer this option if you prefer that .
the new file name , the &amp; publication ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; nbsp ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording , not all cameras set this information . in the side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded into the photo .
the automatic spin turn is switched on , and when your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic spin turn , use the button Advanced and select the auto spin turn right in the bottom of the window .
when your camera comes information about the date on which the photo has been made available , can &amp; digi@@ came ; this sub @-@ row is based on the picture data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras are available . in the page side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can check out what information your camera could have embedded into the photos .
this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option . use the button Advanced and choose the option @-@ based sau@@ lt at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from your computer on their camera is the button download . select then upload , where you can select the files up@@ loaded and select the files up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods choose .
once the selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images are to load up high . a folder @-@ selection dialog appears for the camera . pick the folder you want here and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that is indicated in long@@ itude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map . identifying the data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ ve an area by automatic absorption of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can easily access a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; booking ; users want to send the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to get the position of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ enc@@ es.@@ The question is actually more , as the data in these fields come . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and images using the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally about manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can take place with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which extract data from images and from GPS extract , and cor@@ relate with it . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the Co@@ ast@@ ute Co@@ ordin@@ ates , which are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not display European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; nbsp ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that access the behaviour of &amp; Lock ; change to these settings , you must change settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
action can be displayed on embedded preview or picture editing . you put the standard behavior of &amp; checking ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ ty and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , when the option when downloading the camera collection . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author@@ ship is a syn@@ onym for fi@@ bers . this field should contain the professional photographer of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations , such as employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , non @-@ commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this field must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the photograph the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , as this is the image other &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ eten@@ quot ; . if the image is a warehouse , then the group or agency the image will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ low . thus the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of digi@@ code ; they are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; Lock ; they will be imported without lost .
image lab@@ eling as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , including those embedded in the pictures . therefore , your let@@ tering can also be read from other images . caution : in pictures , which have already been sign@@ posted , will be over@@ written by the analysis .
the page settings contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cursor in the main window on a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; checking out ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to specify which data types and digi@@ code came to indicate , you can add the file exten@@ sible of this list and remove it . Albu@@ quer@@ ner , who did not have any of these extensions ; ignored by &amp; checking . ignored .
the default settings can be reset once again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
if you come to the default values , these settings can be set on this page . however , if you are enabled to open the illumin@@ ator . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better visu@@ alization results .
by default , the picture editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the picture editing in full @-@ screen mode .
over @-@ and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in picture editing , this view @-@ mode can be inserted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation .
by setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , because P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick machine , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression of TI@@ FF images for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss works free .
with the setting of loss free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can store los@@ eness free . even if you were written off loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , metadata still did not support , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; publication ; the picture editing was only an image selection for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the picture editing .
the default size is that all green pixel are equal to ultra @-@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference creates a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 gene patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white is used immediately by the camera . otherwise , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white @-@ off is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting will only support for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors is the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps to get more details in the cutting edge . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ pointed , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ capacity of your camera to view the nickname and adjust them . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some unusual results , since they can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels generally not be as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green@@ - and red portions from the yet saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ous value according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; publication ; to keep the time for the demo@@ lition process , you should proceed conservative .
a de@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image of the particle data , which have many cameras and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; nbsp ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates farms in the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color tax correct as you will be carried out during the trial .
a profile translated the color formations and gives instructions on how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; stock ; information like the Far@@ bin@@ ders from a Far@@ ms to translate into the other are the colors as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions , when a picture is opened in image editing , start / colour administration module with rough files .
color profile folder Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles .
attitudes of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed after opening the raw file later .
the Color Manager view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures in colour not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera producer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which does not contain color mapping or gam@@ bl@@ last@@ y . currently , cra@@ b g@@ amma isn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you may em@@ ulate , as your image has been given by one device . this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller colour range as your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . you could manually correct it instead of leaving the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that the color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles will fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target recognizable : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface which is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image editing ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition find some also in the context menu of the thumb@@ nails .
short @-@ command for tasks that are implemented by modules can be set in the menu under settings short @-@ command .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get on the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the top rec@@ ir@@ regul@@ ator limit the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other cross@@ roads turn off the metadata and / or which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics show on the left a list of all cameras installed on the left . on the right , there is a button ven@@ atic detection which is connected to the computer . however , if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image @-@ line mode . currently , there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a US@@ B@@ or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the cam@@ ou@@ te . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ , specify on which you are hanging your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; use the camera to connect to your computer , bring them into the display mode and turn it on .
try out whether &amp; checking out ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ o@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the Camera Camera .
you can select any name for your camera in the menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option of pol@@ ating dialog for moving out &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the talk of &amp; Lock ; when you delete a photo in one album . in the sections del@@ eting a photos and del@@ eting a recording you will find more details .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly and digi@@ tised , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any feed@@ backs . otherwise , you need to apply changes with the button changes .
they can also include the display of the welcome screen at the start ; at the start @-@ up , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up process from &amp; checking ; .
the setting applause to look for new photos and checking out the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; Lock ; if something was deleted from the basic folder , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you if it should delete it from the database .
different shades can be added in &amp; checking , to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings allow you to select the settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is displayed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , please find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; nbsp ; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and improve and improve . image processing can be started by clicking on the thumb@@ nails of an image or by the right @-@ click menu of the preview or editing .
the picture editing contains a range of tools to enhance your images . so some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; therefore , they may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the picture editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current dates , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar on the upper edge and underneath the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the picture editing your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you saved the file saving or the button saving out of the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it as you want .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu file and use the button Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have made in the photo since last time .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ one by selecting editing @-@ time or restored by selecting editing to the menu .
if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z as a back@@ bone and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to re@@ manufacture .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a moment longer in the tool@@ bar , you will get a right @-@ click menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation device in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or use the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can take in the photo and run zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor automatically
viewing full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come into the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can view this in the dialog dialog by &amp; Lock ; change this way you can view the image window . see the section in setting up the picture editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file image and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print out single images or whole phrases . all picture @-@ pages may be printed out of your choice . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ e printing assistant . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; publication ; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation device . it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked on :
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the let@@ tering view you can enter the marking with unlimited size or insert . note the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed . the marking are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be edited after 2000 characters and are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC address in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have commented on , you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the sign@@ posts are then stored .
besides the apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the review evaluation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in seeking and sorting them . it can be applied with either single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut string . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always applied only to one image . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the review is written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the keywords display a search box to the filter of the keywords , the keywords , and a comb@@ o box with the previous in this &amp; publication ; -@@ session passed .
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the search term . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief in the input of keywords at a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding crosses areas in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word &quot; section .
the page bar key@@ word is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling and view@@ points use . if additionally one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right side , only the cutting of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard tags . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view , to pull you with key@@ word . if the keywords existed , you can easily pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the example , the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter is reduced to a keywords which is reduced the amount to three pictures . they were pulled by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word tree on the selection and dis@@ car@@ ded there . a dialog asks if this keywords should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched between settings and Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross@@ roads at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited there to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it free and checking ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
the reason you use a colour@@ less work@@ flow is the colors that can actually take photographs from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or in the web publish them from your digital dark chamber .
when the topic comes on colour administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is available to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration . additionally , you will provide links with more detailed information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your educational flow met all the criteria specified below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about the colour administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB machine . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image expendi@@ tures are by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone is so easy , why should one then use another color space and thus have to worry about color manager ?
a visual example of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ @-@ fer@@ ring region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ming , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger bul@@ lets , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente site and click on info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kal@@ li@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms ?
yes ! if you work in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms or not , you need to kal@@ li@@ ate your monitor , since the R@@ GB of your monitor joins the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ ms of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic barrier and contrast extend from the menu Kor@@ rigi@@ dly Autom@@ atic correction are automatically trying to make the best out of the menu . you will have to experiment with these effects in order to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize this method scal@@ ding the lumin@@ ance values about the overall picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing color gra@@ ding . this function is often a magnet correction for images that are dark or washed off .
similar : this method j@@ us@@ hed the ligh@@ tening factor of the colours of the selected image , so the hist@@ o@@ gram of the intention is the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same very good results achieved with improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it .
automatic reck@@ age : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright fron@@ tier tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green@@ - and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gram area .
contrast , this method enhances the contrast and volume of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed out images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly limited because over a color @-@ channel is done with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can go too far from the original picture . if you are able to perform the white equal in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode is working , your ways of correc@@ ting better will fall better .
this tool is based on a whi@@ tish pattern of ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it through the menu @-@ fit colors white @-@ off the picture editing .
the entrance window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original video straight again , it goes to the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in hist@@ o@@ gram .
right above , a hist@@ o@@ gram is shown that dynam@@ ically has changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful since , even in good lighted pictures , most pixels have very small le@@ gu@@ itars . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ aire .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , sati@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adju@@ sting you to improve the shadow details of your photos or down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the pictures to use the colour temperature of the white @-@ match . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
additionally , you can set the white immediately with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the excess of the pixel indicator increases colors when more than a color channel of the pix@@ el is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white immediately display . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . each setting of the whi@@ pped of white you can put it in a text file and load it later .
the button @-@ settings returns all the filter values again to its standard values and the corresponding neutral whit@@ eboard . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the code of code per color channel of the converted image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is also available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be carried out . a detailed guide to the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of Color Management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors t@@ worth@@ iness . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error , so you can always use the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; publication ; tool pig@@ ment effects puts you four pig@@ ment effects , a solar effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the image caused by a brief lightning light and subsequently replaced the development of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool permits you to make this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally generates a neg@@ ativity that is not producing as phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process works ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation that makes it a stronger contradiction @-@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimized reverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as greatly saturated color , but also some of the photographers , especially those that are hardly landscapes dis@@ satisfied , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with great pictures the filter can select the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the color contra@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . all your alignment can be viewed with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . all changes that you can perform in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool engra@@ ving and the simple light strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ tion values , a hist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sliding doors into it , and that can be moved to change the intention of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the simplest way to learn the operation is to shift the regul@@ ator and to pay attention to how the image changes .
on the right hand the original and the preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ o@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ o@@ gram is usually dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic patterns will be beneficial .
three re@@ ars : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle notes , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color lacqu@@ er can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically limit the shade of the shade , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
out@@ doing : the ex@@ ams allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the exp@@ atri@@ ots as in the input . for example , the compression of the out@@ going can be used for example , to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the images are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and charging : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be stored and later loaded , the Gimp levels will be used .
if you use this mode and the three color chains , the input will be re@@ usable automatically for all shadows , medium and solar dis@@ cord . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the image of the original image to put the hist@@ uses of the hist@@ o@@ gram for red , green , blue , and le@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the option over@@ loaded indicator index controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display them the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the adju@@ sting of the input used on red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the exp@@ atri@@ ots are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
besides this box , two symbols are to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera , most of the linear mode is the most sensual . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is helping .
if you move for example a cran@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes with dark out@@ bed coinci@@ de and that the image pixel can be darker .
at the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the range you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is named after your taste .
save as and charging : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . file format is the Gimp curve format .
if you create this method and the three colours buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , Middle and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original picture to put the check@@ points for the red , green@@ - , blue and le@@ gu@@ le@@ curve .
the option over@@ load indication is controlled all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; publication ; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the shades of the photo .
the canal @-@ bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the picture editing .
with the channel optional , you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original item can be seen as a comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram to show you the appropriate color value .
controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to switch these channels . in case you can also activate the appropriate paint components , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tools for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the gre@@ ener for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color to a visible smoke that comes from the bul@@ king . Far@@ ms consists of small smokers that doesn &apos;t appear in the same place in the color canal and whose smoking pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion in which you will reduce the Far@@ ms first .
the storing as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can save you for later and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ loaded indicator index controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display them the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue Channel has been re@@ activated . the L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance option is enabled ( 1 ) and the original picture is under ( 2 ) to see .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white a working step , since color pictures can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ ers .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good from all the scenarios and fits especially well with portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a st@@ aves of lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Orange filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ estial effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar time to day @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lowing filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow ruler . this is the most natural shade @-@ correct and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creating hot bright and medium tones while he adds a little cold in the shade of a pressure and re @-@ development in an epi@@ ic . this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; publication ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color @-@ painting or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the thrust of an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; nbsp ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to insert the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ et@@ ting eye . under the picture the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter you place the desired type of type for your picture . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) , abbrevi@@ ated it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a bone of garlic and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this combined target picture will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool by side ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also works at several places if you need it .
using this tool is very intuitive to user . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the bul@@ ls and character set with its characteristics as you need . you will be the drawing character of the image size . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is ready .
any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; publication ; tool template apply , you can put a template on an image .
the menu image P@@ abl@@ one uses in image processing can be used to create checks on an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to take advantage of P@@ NG files and should be included with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the template , so send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; publication ; mail@@ ing@@ list checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for a first time , you must put in dialog with the &quot; base folder in dialog &quot; button . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , appears a component view , which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the pres@@ ch@@ eline of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ized : this button res@@ ized the underlying picture . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you must reduce the image according to the mouse button . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
OK , if you want to apply the template on your image . the image is then adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; digi@@ came ; three different tools are available for viewing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates especially in dark areas , gran@@ ny pictures .
Un@@ shar@@ p mask works at the contrast of edges to let an image shar@@ per . in fact , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , since he really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a little bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements are smaller than the dissolution . the same phenomenon can be observed when color @-@ points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more detrimental than normal cameras for private users .
with JP@@ EG images , a camera is often applied for up@@ swing . images in the raw @-@ format is always to be cured in during processing .
some scanner do a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by calling a photo with the edge @-@ edge di@@ ver . you can also call the navigation protocol to the menu recording .
you should deal with this , however , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also rein@@ forcing the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image the tool re@@ focus . you can get more information and a comparison of all techniques to do .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than to raise it . use the tool to create a soft character with the menu entry . use the tool display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the thumb@@ nails will help edit the image . the video window displays the issue of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate often good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the blur@@ redness mask become too strong , smoke and get an impression of atrocities in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of a canal are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . they therefore should take pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is being added to the original . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference of difference . one can thus define a minimum difference for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones of shar@@ ps and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces , directions and ur@@ anium surfaces .
this is an example of un@@ sharp mas@@ king filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ ate = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool Re@@ focused re@@ focused on an image by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted @-@ protected unfolding filter of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool looks a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused more than just trying to shar@@ pen@@ alize the photo . he uses a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus usually better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ viewing in image editing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung is working much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel , which is far from the original pixel . however , the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value when your image is very blur@@ red but should be careful on hal@@ o vou@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in the correlation may help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 % . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will even be lubric@@ ated .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this parameter is most commonly caused by a shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ paid zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
size : this value determines the size of the Transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase in matri@@ p size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ge &apos;s edge . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the storing as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try all the cutting , color@@ ations , and Inten@@ sive ti@@ fications on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much sur@@ geries changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts .
if you are reading images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than ac@@ ut@@ ations . this could be caused by this , the un@@ sharp mas@@ king also uses a larger neighborhood than ac@@ ut@@ ations .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ redness . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made using an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficiently light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of raising correc@@ tions in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ th@@ ness puts the blur@@ redness of the area that was bl@@ acked to produce a natural sweet@@ ener .
the color @-@ tin@@ ts allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to take blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool missing error is one of the most developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are enumer@@ ated below :
if you want to sort the filter flavor f@@ ain@@ ting you can use the rider glasses and advanced settings .
detailed reserve p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ ther bet on the picture . weigh@@ ed up against larger values chie@@ fly homo@@ geneous regions and detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be necessary . please note that the deta@@ il@@ ence always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ th@@ ed ev@@ enly into all directions while a value close to 1 only in one direction . in case you have a high value of wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best positioned at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thes &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore put this value fitting to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ th@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repeat : specify how often the algorithm is going through . usually , there is 1 or 2 dates .
angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should also be small chosen . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de span &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ative step into pixel . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small . he doubles the term . we therefore recommend it to permit him .
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . every setting of educational errors can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later .
correct imaging is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how imaging with little ar@@ te@@ facts can be removed . the module is taken in a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there are a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground , that through a bad movies during the trip , the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensation from the camera or fashion ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ kets that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius is controlled by the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filters . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can accum@@ ulate the picture . the area shown by the radius is moving across the image and color in it becomes smoo@@ thes and thus minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value determines the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ov@@ ation to determine . if it is lifted up the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ov@@ ation to determine if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and smoke or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise will be removed or noise tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ ise when you want to remove a sh@@ m@@ ite sound or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ants of the image . we recommend you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that controls the details -@@ settings .
colour : controls the shade of the picture . we recommend you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve one image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that controls the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker ranges which are typically stronger than to increase . however , it swal@@ lows also the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adjustment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is increased , the edges can occur if it can occur to a minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear at the edges . he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and charging : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how rough reducing your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ y for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately to draw much easier than an image . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry . use the device window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; publication ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic production .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable ar@@ te@@ facts about your images . it is very well adapted to remove gau@@ ze &apos;s sound noise , cinem@@ at@@ ography , compression ar@@ te@@ ar@@ te@@ ar@@ te and local bugs which emerge in digital , original or detrimental digital images , thereby gaining the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm may be used for color and text installation . the tex@@ tual composition is carried out with another tool , the image failed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ado and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as being a los@@ sy com@@ pres@@ sion@@ salt , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; Arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude finds these problems correct .
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quick at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore dis@@ rupt the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how a photo with in@@ comparable noise is reduced .. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ined on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo created with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts caused by the sc@@ anning lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos showing with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin dick@@ head .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras have JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a photo with a dark image method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to accommodate you the dark image right next to discover new hot or bright pixels with C@@ CD defect .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark picture to the corrected picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard notes the last dark and that automatically invites you to the next meeting again .
the picture area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture . the preview display shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are taken out in all disciplines .
select an area to preview the def@@ ective pixels on the thumb@@ nails and the results of the filter . select afterwards the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : it becomes an average of the adjacent pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block to be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ o : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo taken from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , which was applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; nbsp ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. lower corners , one image .
for@@ esi@@ ght lenses , especially the medium @-@ sized and large photo format , can often be illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that the sensor can be achieved there . they may also show this behavior .
but it also has cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ ending filter , which it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . pu@@ zz@@ ling objects should also use with center filters to use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ matched effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and colour scanner , digital cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by sim@@ ulating a equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a raw material that is applied without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction is applied to an image . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery and with three other inser@@ tion of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting sub@@ du@@ es at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with a bl@@ ending filter of 1 , or random@@ ly of a light intensity of 2 , distor@@ tive .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree to compens@@ ate .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ation reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators provide you with only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a hostile to adjust the target image , let the value for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; publication ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance and contra@@ sting correction was also done with the image using this tool .
the &amp; publication ; lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des covers the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar coating effect , fla@@ wed but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to which the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of pad distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the Gra@@ des . this value affects more at edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners are the opposite sign of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads a correction to the first Gra@@ des through . negative values increase while positive the image decreased .
clear : this value j@@ us@@ ks brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correct . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values .
the ton@@ n@@ - or stamp @-@ shaped correction should be done before all the cutting or size changes . best perform this correction than all the first by . if you cut a picture and carry out a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point . afterwards , you can fix the ton@@ n@@ - / ho@@ ist distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a pad that will correct the resulting image black corners . you can convert it using the cutting @-@ tool in the menu transform@@ ers from image processing , or over the z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialogue .
for most images the t@@ onal correction is taken . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like e.g. recording from the front , frames and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulating infrar@@ ed movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrar@@ ed movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitive area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you can move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters set gra@@ ining and cinem@@ atic sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to sim@@ ulate a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gra@@ ining and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
because the filter channels mix to the reproduce of infrar@@ ed film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color formations are missing .
this is an example of the infrar@@ ed film effect applied to a landscap@@ ing photo of New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the painted image below ( 2 ) . the sensation of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ tern .
the &amp; publication ; filter footage is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ zing on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed film such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensi@@ tiveness of the movies that manufacturers large silver gran@@ ces of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film @-@ body effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the standard value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of film light effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that used the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; publication ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for big pictures . gl@@ ass@@ works controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the soft@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ ness 17 .
the &amp; stock came ; filter coal drawing used color and intention gra@@ dient to create a carbon fiber . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the cap sel@@ ects the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ ks the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the cohesion filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved further through the adjustment of the Inten@@ sive value .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was ring@@ ed in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; nbsp ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ily landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it looks through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave blocks 1 will dist@@ orts the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate the calculation and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by blur@@ redness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines which eman@@ ates from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ red camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal of removal : blur@@ red the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft@@ ness Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image soft into the dark and strong in the light tones . this produces photos with an dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ shar@@ p : blur@@ red the picture by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of an arbitrary movable camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the color @-@ colour in the image and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need a long time for the calculation and cause a high CPU load . this calculation can therefore dis@@ rupt any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to take reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ protected algorithm .
dro@@ plet size allows it to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the dri@@ p size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish @-@ eyes changes the optical effect of drops in the image .
you can maintain a range of shelves . use the tool @-@ free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the tool @-@ tool to select the area , for example a face that is to stay free . if you start after afterwards the filter stops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ieren Dre@@ w , or Transform@@ ing mir@@ rors .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
to reduce an image is simple . the big question is how to infl@@ ate an image and stop the details ? how can you invent the missing information or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ its size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to join the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; use a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are enumer@@ ated below :
maintaining aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the input of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ th@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and charging are used precisely for this . each entry for photo can be used as text file and can be loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel calculation time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small colour picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common surgical procedure , but also a frequently underestimated tool to merge an image . in order to add a photo , you need to use the mouse just the rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rec@@ tan@@ gle , then you will see this rec@@ tan@@ gle while you move the mouse .
when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo look like after the cutting area . you can pull the size of the one to cutting area by moving at the corners of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . you can create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button the cutting @-@ button of the picture editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file saving or storing in the menu file to save the newly cut picture .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the side ratio that you have defined in dialogue will be preserved .
in the tool by side ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format will always be assigned to the width .
the tool by side ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you use centimeters , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons are ext@@ ant to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
down in dialog you can set up with the max. ratio of the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool by side ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizontal direc@@ tional or Ver@@ tical ) . when you use the cutting tool , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , allowing the EX@@ IF data to reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the combination assistance help enable help to put your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of the similarity . as the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to share a rec@@ tan@@ gle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
Golden Center : the golden middle is a division that appears on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the blood blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence of 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 13 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 ,
the golden middle provides a liquid supply line when you set up a picture . these aids are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ third round , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition takes the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visu@@ alised river on this way .
another rule is called the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rectangular area . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also guided by the above @-@ sided golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the sides of the golden corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not a tiny triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can be pl@@ ated a static object to dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break up your frame and create an effect of professional photographers dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your photo @-@ focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options flip horizontal flip and flip @-@ flip can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic parts .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image around any angle .
if you do a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which things came around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; publication ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose to use transform@@ ative free rotation and j@@ us@@ ks the target angle .
rot@@ ate your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ der are stated in degrees . with the button preferences you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cursor in the image to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can note the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned out an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transform@@ ers to use from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the feature Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option shows the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transformations are done by a fix@@ ture of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares of the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right of the transforming area .
after the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get in@@ geni@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way of doing this is the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of image editing .
the vehicle &apos;s tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no turning , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can use this module through transforming ourselves .
use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you push for pres@@ ets , the angle will return to zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the picture , the picture becomes a bit blur@@ ry . for a single she@@ aring , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two types of wor@@ ms twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ dding , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers out of image editing .
&amp; nbsp ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; checking .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF underneath .
&amp; Ds returned only files in formats that knows . this is done by file extending and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions ; change the file . in the configuration you can find more information .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the used format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . and digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material , you can read at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous World and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw materials images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw converter by &amp; Lock ; convert . in the configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; checking . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats produced by &amp; Lock :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . however , these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but it is not a film editor . however , when you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; configure the videos to play movies to play@@ back the program .

many tools you need the photo editing are contained in &amp; checking , included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as ac@@ ut@@ ches , soft@@ ness , noise @-@ sup@@ press , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp , &amp; etc . . use a single dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the filter &apos;s status on the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :

the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters while shooting the photos . these data originates from the EX@@ IF data when available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature . you can press with the mouse wheel or run zo@@ oming . move it while you drag the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . obviously , this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data included .
&amp; color@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used to edit colors pal@@ ettes and to select and naming colors .
the p@@ alle@@ ts files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts or browse the folder after files .
the cursor is displayed in the P@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by chew@@ ing the area next to a color .
it indicates the color of it . the color is described under the P@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the cros@@ sover box is activated under the button color , the color will be inserted either , or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode was selected to write . this mode lets you adjust when selecting the cross@@ box below the cursor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; color@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a pointer character if another color is followed . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as one color in &amp; color@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose one color somewhere on the screen and then select them in the shade on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer : is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are available in science , especially in computer science . until now there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs . programs which include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer : project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer : is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewers ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of the graph in &amp; Kate ; representing the graphs ) and presented in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ;
menu to open the graphs at &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component
load of large graphs ( currently there are issues from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
another required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which is the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for the presentation of the graph .
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar is empty like in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file open and the ( blank ) list un@@ har@@ med files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner will be displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than drawing space . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel is used ( high and down without special flas@@ hes , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum gra@@ zing of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; graphic viewer : loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re @-@ loaded , or whether you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings box ; set ... see also .
if you open an graph@@ ite outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; the instance , &amp; eg . in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer : an instance or want to show the to @-@ charge graph in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can permanently save your choice but also change it with the dialog dialog .
at the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
when you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be integrated into a page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages published graphs without head@@ line and with another font
the page once again give you the possibility to set the behavior if a file is changed on the hard drive , eg , by another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or dis@@ regard the changes ) or the program every time im@@ inqu@@ ire .
opening will give the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph outside of a current session is opened . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window open or specify in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that every time is being asked .
the site management provides the ability to define the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if they are asked to be asked for each of them .
the context menu , which is usually at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it will open up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm that produces standard for targeted graph@@ ene . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graphs . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ cuts .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ ing graphs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ session model . it uses the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai that is syn@@ onymous with statistics of multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces for invali@@ ds Grap@@ hic a spr@@ ing@@ model -@@ layout . he uses the Fru@@ @-@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ moon for the treatment of large and cl@@ ums@@ y graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm prescribed the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , in 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams from multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog , where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such layers command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options give , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of the graphs ( directed or invali@@ d ) and turns to the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invali@@ ds graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed as if this is necessary . otherwise it is not shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse @-@ cursor at . click with this pointer to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes will be available at this address and in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the basic folder of the source code .
&amp; graphic viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it needs the following program@@ ing packages :
a special setting is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; to use in the menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol @-@ editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar tool@@ bar , the bar range , the .@@ color palette , and the grid network in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialogue in which you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or if you want to start anew .
introduces the last one step again . if you do not have a step back@@ wards , this function is down@@ lighted .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read and provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources and saving them . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner that supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
when you scan the images in the menu item , a dialog , which lets you choose between all available sources on your machine . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the pre @-@ given default values to select your image in accordance with the button sc@@ anning the image . the cher@@ ished file size is displayed in the right corner , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information .
be sure that the window will be completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
once you have pushed the button sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to commemor@@ ate the options of the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . you will also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; choose or create the image saved .
screen photos can create after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ tier@@ - &gt; scre@@ enshot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop reading in order to read a single window under the mouse .
when all of your program window selected , the calling @-@ up program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to get the time to navigate .
after the scre@@ enshot was processed , the dialog &apos;s dialog appears with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization permits the GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image to add and edit . geographical data is stored into the EX@@ IF reporting of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation makes tools available to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical co @-@ system , which is used by GPS and Galileo , to loc@@ alize . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ .@@ g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
Bild Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alisation Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above mentioned dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you must download a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , data will be included in the same locations at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded one automatic correlation is carried out the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera should be revers@@ ed with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . place here your camera @-@ time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ ation . if the devi@@ ation is led below , the results are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating is in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can put these boundaries here and then push the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have done a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog joins the coordinates from one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map and enlarge . choose the area in the area and enlarge again . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be switched between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang on the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages form to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the char@@ set will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted . you need to select these albums only . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . you can quickly select a large number of albums at the right side . in the range below , you can quickly see a large number of albums . in the section below , you will see the clip and text that will appear in the HTML side .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely expl@@ ain@@ able . the option for each picture creates a page in which each picture gets its own page . if you then click on a picture a new page will be displayed , otherwise the image will appear directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you write your name . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ available Export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color @-@ depth you can change the standard color @-@ color . of course , the file size also influences . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider Pres@@ sure allows you to see some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . push the break down to break the process .
if the module created the pages the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore read the program@@ m@@ line to determine if errors during the generation occurred . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the thumb@@ nails .
the K@@ IP@@ I image concerned is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image concerned allows you to look at a selection of images and carry on them basic operations like swi@@ m@@ ings , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short description and mouse @-@ mouse . it has been designed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed as a full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is to increase the file size , since no compres@@ sing of the color formations happen . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then you can copy the file optional dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the picture to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slides .
the module MPEG kitchen@@ ettes can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , using a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WA@@ V of the Sli@@ deshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the Sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD players . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . afterwards , you can create over extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you selected will then be enumer@@ ated in picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting pictures or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . if you are planning to re@@ configure the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds which will display an image below . a low value creates very sudden , a high against contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file you can specify the name of the MPEG output file . keep track of the app@@ alling file .
in case you specify an audio file , in the name of the audio file , it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your host you can start to drink the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your host you can go quickly or in all tranquility a coffee and enjoy the slides , when you are back .
if an indication appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages right down the button .
the printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the imaging Gimp . this is for example , to enhance you or to printing with the Gimp module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command lines d@@ cra@@ b from Dave Coff@@ in . an original sense of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ b not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values new to the converting process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the whit@@ eboard used . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue Ver@@ mi@@ cks can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected so you can use the contra@@ st@@ information . if your camera in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and used the los@@ eness free LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
in case you are planning to edit your images frequently or you later otherwise use the JP@@ EG format because there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format the metadata that included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data .
when you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to ab@@ ort this process again , you can use it to break down .
the st@@ acking machine mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode if you &apos;re sure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to automatically re@@ write the existing file . however , a preview is not available . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to un@@ compressed all images in an album . it uses the convert convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to set the starter and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce the image or enlarge . in addition , four types of picture change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the orientation orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : proportions in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tionally : dis@@ proportionate share in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation processing : prepares the picture for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the previous images beforehand . additional pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be drawn and put there .
after you started the module , the images -@@ window with the images you selected will be displayed . you can add additional pictures to the selected images via the button . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list , and where to add it to you to add the list of images to be seen .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of shown images .
once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . here you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are attached as attachment attached .
don &apos;t be careful not to send a lot of images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the above emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every@@ time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer beforehand . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments on the pictures will be added to a text file and add the mail attached .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among loss free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend that JP@@ EG format .
if you are selecting JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the larger images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages , looking for errors , see . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Sch@@ left you can switch this window ?
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you want to have your slides . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will use very elegant image out@@ puts by means of OpenGL . however , you need to own an appropriate graphic card as otherwise the slides will be very slow .
display the file name indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
this option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c after that .
the option pictures selected by chance makes sure the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not the order of the pictures used in the album .
while del@@ aying between the pictures can be set the temporal distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should try this before you show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects any transition between images another effect .
during the di@@ dri@@ au , you can access to a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
on the left bottom of the screen , you can view the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to put an image as a background image for the surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE &apos;s surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with remarks you can see with &amp; k@@ ative album ; see this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you typ@@ ed information when you look at your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each of them is described .
if you express the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changed . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your impact .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ ative album ; however , for each person to store your own appearance , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button , which is on the right outside the tool@@ bar . in this context , you can select what view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can refer to e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords . ( if you do not have appropriate images for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose to specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now you can select the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the enlarge factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image is to be displayed or dis@@ edited .
if you visit the main window in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the commemor@@ ative of the image properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture one more time .
if you enter a string into the let@@ tering or description , the fittings and descriptions of the pictures are searched for . if you wish , you can also enter a date according to which the date may be searched for , i.e. , for example , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ ative album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but prefer to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ ative album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ eting album ; and choose in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ eting album ; start the first time , or select the menu for the menu entry into the menu item . as a result , some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ ative album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ eting album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this Le@@ els shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display you several different time units . each tab shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the list only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ actively use the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview of the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline always displayed the current date of the moment displayed when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button de@@ pressed and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so draw the tim@@ ings . if you select a area , you &apos;ll just preview images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ ative album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ ative album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the one is described in &amp; k@@ ative album ; integrated version described you can create via the HTML menu ...
before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each section is exactly described .
first enter the title of the song and a description that is to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ ative album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ ative album ; -@@ export file should be created on the Over@@ view page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that all images are displayed by a party . note that &amp; k@@ ative album ; currently all pictures exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain watching .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clear why this is not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions to the pictures . therefore , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . so he can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , browse . if he wants to get an image larger then he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , set the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if they &apos;re really all visible for viewers . if you choose to choose a URL for the base folder . if you have created for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you still does not have to copy it into the final destination folder , so that the import @-@ function , see , correctly works you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described setup possibilities have all three at basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in the output folders .
if you are looking at a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ eting album ; however , you might want to write a HTML page to look at the pictures . however , if you have already done a lot of time , pictures , people on the pictures , recording , etc. then you need to do with &amp; k@@ ative album ; this work doesn &apos;t even do .
with &amp; k@@ ative album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the Bil@@ de@@ i@@ Properties will be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored on the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all the images can be stored in the file , and that this file can pass on as independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a two way . first , the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have indicated in creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
the following is the dialog for the export of images described above the menu file ex@@ porting .
the most important option for this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the option manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of .@@ k@@ im file copy copy &amp; k@@ eting album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already compressed compressed and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do this anyway , simply select the option of export file .
the last option on this page is a maximum size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , then the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is to be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import ... select is &amp; k@@ atory album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to impor@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you must select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called to your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog window , which categories of imported file should be imported and which categories do this in your database .
in the fourth step you can see the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : when you see pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy &apos;s holiday and discover a picture with your friend about it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will undergo the various steps from ( 1 ) to set up the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the review and view , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ ative album ; saves all of his information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of her images . this is a simple XML file , which you can back with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , backup on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ ative album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ ative album ; therefore , another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ ative album ; using the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ ative album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ ative album ; set up ... enter a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ ative album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings .
on the left you see six different symbols , which you can preview the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can call through a key@@ press to the F1 button and one click on the desired option .
it was described in you how to define different properties for each image , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to already process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of telling all groups of an intermedi@@ ary like in .
in view of the setup options available to you , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you will find a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ ative album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed through the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ ative album ; but most modules possess a help page which you can access through the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ ative album . therefore , you should always use new modules first with the demo database . demo @-@ database you can either call via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ ative album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ ative album ; not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ ative album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ ative album .
sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ ative album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images , which shows you the picture show at the moment .
next to the latest album you have to play &amp; k@@ ative album ; the modules also contained a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ ative album : as follows :
if &amp; k@@ atory album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you want to use the category individuals , for example , if you have chosen individuals to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ ative album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select in the area modules , which modules are loaded .
in the picture you will see an example of a seat screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ eting album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are accustomed to using it from any other KDE application , you can see at the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you can browse the window with which you have entered your image database . at the moment , we &apos;ll get back to this window , now click on the entry show that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ ative album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes . to include information about the people listed on the picture , where the picture has been recorded , etc . you can apply each image either individually or for a larger number of images to place certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all images included in Copenhagen .
all these remarks can be used for seeking and browse as you can read in the section . if you want you can see this note if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists using a text box by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ ative album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of the pictures inside the list : if you have a family celebration and displayed on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign the persons faster .
if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date below the list .
if you have any comments on each image individually selected , you might want to edit any selected images and provide these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are at the top of the picture at the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. by the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multi@@ ghter entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
the picture shows a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that this is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the acknowled@@ gement , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry into a category and place it in order to sort out this to an sub@@ category of this item . attention , this requires you just sort out your category alphabe@@ tically . see for this .
you can move the individual elements of the feature templates , by clicking on the list that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window @-@ area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that gives you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options ... and click here to enter the window . see this step in the picture .
if you choose to display images in the browser you &apos;ll get an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected images , or any images in case you have no filters . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simple times .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on one image , this will be displayed in the image right . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture of images , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the pictures . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete , or select either the Dele@@ te button or select in the Edit menu . now you will see the window displayed in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ative album ; it provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use the images stored in your hard drive . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so you can record the pictures in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ atory album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper left is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nail pictures exist , so that &amp; k@@ ative album ; you can also preview these images , but you can also view these pictures with the image palette .
as you see , this function takes you to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you do not want to ask for the installation of the question in question . if you want to avoid anger , such as the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you can easily filter the images that you want for others to be in@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent View privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the images that your little sister can see , con@@ ta@@ sters and the menu item all except current view .
this means you have specified what images are hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all images that you have blocked , hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be inserted to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
remember that this picture @-@ protection is not quite safe . at one hand , all images on the hard drive and to the other can anyone who access the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete . this kind of password protection serves only to those who are playing with &amp; k@@ ative album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the look at private pictures .
the reason why you would like to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ ative album ; of course , manage them at some time . this is why you want to look at them sometime . for this reason it has a picture _ and Video@@ viewing . you can preview how to start in .
the viewer can see you in . he shows of course the image , but additional all the information you enter over the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see it , you can also configure the mouse and disc@@ ard it . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the right @-@ click menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to show this . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were chosen by persons of the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ lat@@ ch . as often , a new image can be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g Taste and Plus or minus . start and stopped the slides by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ ative album ; it is in full @-@ screen mode to change . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can drag the image into the image and drawn out . with the min@@ us button you can easily rip a rec@@ tan@@ gle onto the middle of the picture . shows how a zo@@ oming box is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not being zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ als key the zo@@ oms continues , so each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work in videos are that in and out of zo@@ oming with the plus and fold @-@ key .
with the function functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you view images it can happen that you &apos;ll find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the view and enter the configuration dialog of the picture in order to mark these names . however , you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the picture and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want can start the spect@@ ator with the images and mark them as good or bad , while you look at one by one .
for the two examples above there is the opportunity to provide images with characteristics while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view you see an image where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features to your pictures , these are available in the browser . so you can see all images that you edit , print or whatever selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special characteristics can be displayed in thumb@@ nail . if you can display categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by simply checking the letters for the character after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you are allowed to draw &amp; k@@ eting album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image but in the database . in the manner you can und@@ one your painted later .
in addition , you can see an image painted on the painted . in order to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to end the M@@ alen , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire drawing .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following listing menu will end , so you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click menu of the right button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene .

when you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview of your own opinion .
keep in preview in the self @-@ viewing view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture will have chosen , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture inside a texture Map and not the entire texture Map ) , depart local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shifting of pulling with the mouse within the whole window .
each object as a wire model has a Visi@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only appear if they are selected or their visual level smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar of the paste .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window regulation as default . the object tree and the view of the object Properties will be shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .

if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the symbol rendering the symbol rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item scene ren@@ ders .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to create a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or select View modes ... select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , makes sense , but a name that can recognize the properties of the mode .
in the mapping card size , you can register the width and height of the picture image . if you want only one small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section of the rendering into the input fields .
in the field of quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders use . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual and Po@@ v@@ ray .
when a picture is loaded with just a beam depending on the pixels , different errors can emerge . these images often have a fashion design or on @-@ screen effect in curves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if it is in the presentation of less than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures are better viewed with this property .
when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and linking &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is continually expanding and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on its calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray a Stra@@ hl per pixel . if you adjust the lowering value to 4 pixels with super sampling . if you adjust the lowering value to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a repository of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays depending on the pixels .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels . if the difference between the color value exceeds the pre @-@ determined threshold , then the pixels is divided in 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be tr@@ acked individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of drugs for beam process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can adjust if the alpha can@@ als are to be calculated via POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays do not have an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene to import , select the menu entry file to import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full instruction of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if , when imports occur , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Be@@ gin and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can export objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert spring code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene renal . usually , this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the equity view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation at the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example of al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected checks .
the color of the triangle on the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid @-@ click menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the buttons for shifts , sc@@ ali@@ zations and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better r@@ appro@@ ch@@ ement for the displayed objects , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed diagram for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire models are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection screens . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and sensitive proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you indicate wall wall , a wall behind the objects is rounded . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you cross the floor , a soil below the objects is rounded . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you activate can@@ ten@@ ding scor@@ ching , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the rendering of the scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can adjust you . precise information on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ modes .
this page allows you to modify existing window orders or create new window systems . in the window frames , you can create and store window orders .
the combin@@ atory field standard window : displays all available window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list available window frames shows all available window orders . a new arrangement can create you with the button , and delete a selected order with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be made with the button to add a select views with the button Dele@@ te .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ plug the window under the existing window , with a map card you get a selection of cards along with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start without precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners is very popular : a ball on a layer .
but you should note the following warnings carefully before you complain that you &apos;ll get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for a first time , you should note these important rules :
when you don &apos;t set the camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert any light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark , and you get just a black picture .
if you have all error @-@ free installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following presented window types :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please refer to the documentation , so that you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item editing . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice the scene in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the View properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please find more details .
don &apos;t change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later directions , but note that the camera in view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check point and drag it to the desired place .
when you use the button or push the input button , the wire models and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene here from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might want to insert a qu@@ ader ( insert End@@ al body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reliable method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; in fact offers a simpler way . you can insert an infinite plane as a ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the plane as well , even at the moment only as a limited plane . when you ring the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can view the entry for the ground . in this case , you will find the default options for each new object : scal@@ ding , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties .
in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shifting and set the values as below :
first select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . you can change the name in the object view ( name = soil @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button , preview how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment will only show a mat@@ ured black material because you need to enter the settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now you take the easiest option now .
if you do not have a preview on quot@@ a and ball , please click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you are having a click on the symbol now , you should get the following results :
of course , this is not the farms . you need to enter two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can do so much more frequently , but the chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object Properties :
this step you should simply run out because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the ground :
in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button ) so the ball is float above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit down .
of course the rendering results in a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ured black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select Inv@@ est sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click the ball pig@@ ment , select then mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and place the values as below :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the display images and click on it or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ me surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ pricing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ es , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which mir@@ rors the scenes ) by each pixel into the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects as for example fog . so the scene will be pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye , by which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene , which should be lo@@ osed , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be added to this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a space place .
the scene has been re @-@ recorded in the last recorded version . all changes since the last store will be rejected .
this menu entry can only then select if you have not stored stored changes in the scene .
repeat the most recently re@@ vert command . this menu entry can only then select if you have used mach@@ inations .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cuts and standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new links with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands may change or add new .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ box . you can add and remove options using this option tool@@ tip for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove commands .
a bu@@ mp @-@ map is a way to mod@@ ulate noise surfaces , without having to model any bu@@ mp on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and for a texture Map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by applying a image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewing and web browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key returns .
you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a password is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by using Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog inser@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two other , short @-@ command for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next time opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full @-@ screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are shown that the program can also be displayed .
this option is enlarged for large pictures to display the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
determine if the slideshow with the first image is to begin in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ ps is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until they use the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field . default is 1 .
modify here the short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the mapping cards short @-@ command for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays big symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
aug@@ mented the picture by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the picture .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file you &apos;re looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image processing based on the &amp; publication ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; publication ; project management .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ pic ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ cas@@ ing : to inform you as easy as possible errors or potential improvements . this indicates a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the guide to post your message .
&amp; show@@ cas@@ ing ; is a project supported by a community . that is , that users and developers are helping each other . if you want to join another user of the show@@ rooms . here , you can ask questions to other users of the show@@ rooms . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , English will be spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ pic ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing .
&amp; show@@ cas@@ ing ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you must change settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ an indicator has been selected . of course , the colors with what you are supposed to show , in contrast it should be a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ rooms , has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . the same page bar can also be found in picture editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that does not power more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that does not power more than images to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for storing or save the images in a specified folder of automatically generated names and format . the user can also show the images before storage .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner is indicated , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . breaking &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options do not cover especially .
in order to add a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to select the image better the user can expand into the image and out of the current selections . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview is fit in the window .
when the picture was chosen then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings selected , then the picture is displayed in a preview window , then the picture is displayed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? s leads to a break@@ age and you get back to the main window .
through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be chosen .
this attitude allows them to select the type as &amp; sc@@ ant@@ l@@ ite ; pictures can choose to select . dialog to save for each picture opens the dialog front of each saved image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to automatically store this automatically with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to be saved without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images stored at the option save without being stored after a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialog to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to save pictures and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to store . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical view@@ ix the every@@ time is stored when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to the storing quality . this value changes also the compression value when saving . if choose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Over starts the KDE About -@@ dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings reveals the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these cuts and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and selecting global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and choose short @-@ command .
you may set up any existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; this will make your keyboard on the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ o@@ K has many general functions which are mostly available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP features of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function pause could be &amp; eg .
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ o@@ K still has some own instruction options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependence . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use dialog dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not work .

in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange with Amar@@ o@@ K and control Amar@@ o@@ ok . the simplest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should be included .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec function is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason scripts should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to indicate the setup dialog . if a script is started , every script should take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ K sets the working folder in the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now go &amp; eg . with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length ) .
volum@@ etric change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ o@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ men@@ able @ Tit@@ le , revealing the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . in order to remove an entry the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script via add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu How@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to run for example sets . e.g. the store of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks &apos;s script can also install script packages , which has downloaded the user &amp; eg . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can detect the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ K script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the wi@@ dening of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lo@@ ad@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . perhaps you will also find only a very particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collector browser and quick search will find you the piece within seconds .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg . Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the features and gallery of screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package of ger@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as OS@@ D make predic@@ ting that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will thus function , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are ready to create an excellent development environment .
most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can view the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log in . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang onto the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that day @-@ lib when reading the Met@@ a information from this file , please report this bug to the conference Li@@ b developers below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
in case you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is a bit mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled using the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x have been compiled , then this results in closing the met@@ a information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automation . off , if in@@ active for ... in the adjustment of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , you will send us a good che@@ at , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but this does not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbolic effects will easily be forgotten . you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : the symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app , please check if Amar@@ o@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen using ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ K takes the right version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems clarify themselves on the ligh@@ test by means of an expert on your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ eno@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ K .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please insert there only one mistake , if something is on the removal of a fault in Amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces go there now ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under extras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ ung 1.4 Fast For@@ ward . stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the evaluation column and select column review . click anywhere in the new assessment column , to specify the score for one piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ K is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select a playlist from the folding menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the add @-@ button , you can save the playlist button . click on it .
probably you are missing the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at li@@ b@@ lower , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the tool@@ bar below your quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support so pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even code both text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default , no MP3 @-@ dec@@ ors will be provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ o@@ Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously track audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software Mix@@ ers ) .
the issue of this instruction was to help you find the problem of a problem and a solution . for G@@ hi@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ words ) .
this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media needs to be de@@ coded . however , an MP3 sound is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ cor with little over@@ head . G@@ Stret@@ amer read the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to al@@ sa , just as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that this wr@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fying the sound @-@ buffer in your al@@ sa furnishings .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stret@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the fastest Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less income are responding to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us remedy him .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the gin@@ seng driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ K before ! ) : - Up@@ per@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report of it below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / requests , send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ at @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar programme and let the alarm run on this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you are awakened by the gentle tones of the music that you stopped before going to bed .

my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ o@@ K the collection database can not be created and on the console many error messages appear .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ v MySQL support .
place the CD below , then click on the CD @-@ CD with multiple folders . for normal selection , you can switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result .
you can list the rating for a piece itself by clicking on a column trans@@ cription in the play@@ lists . then select assessment . then you can click on the score of a piece in the same way , by clicking on the piece and click Edit : review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating also in dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you &apos;re going to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means : KDE packages have a fixed release plan that is not associated with the short notice plan of Amar@@ o@@ K .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can easily find annoying . disable the option symbol to play animated in the general settings .

if you would like to use Al@@ sa , please use the latest version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ ks and thus also a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok was installed ; compiled , before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not compiled this output modules ; you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that installed the development files separated from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files are installed . you must now install the package to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix ?
your version of G@@ stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ink , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ ink . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : use@@ d@@ n no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS as you compile Amar@@ o@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use Al@@ sa . how can you use Amar@@ o@@ K the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ K set up ... audio @-@ output give you the device one . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :

type in the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio @-@ issue with Arts will not be further taken care of . you may of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you would like , you can use the new as much @-@ needed tut@@ ors for Arts : )
music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the furnishing assistant who would like to update your collection later on . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the assistant simply don &apos;t like , then you will have these quick start @-@ instructions . with their help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small box to filter the collection facilitates the search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add this playlist to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have already enabled the option to convert play@@ lists to playlist , you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist you want .
to play an audio CD , select actions to play audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD @-@ pieces in WA@@ V format . drag the WA@@ V files easily into the playlist and then press the button play@@ back .
the audio CD function uses the audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; install the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages will be listed , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages to a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but a playlist that is superior to all the others . the playlist window contains several browsers , with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
in this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K are being used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control center . at the top of the window there is a run text display that returns the current current piece or the current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the game currently exp@@ ired at the remaining time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , also under the run text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press the keyboard on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
among the running tex@@ tan@@ ces are also the buttons called PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activated the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play@@ back buttons , the volume regulation and the piece of Posi@@ tions slide . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or the volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can start playing / stop and move the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and operates with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Klassi@@ k to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preference .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer you use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button E@@ Q in player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer field , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but have not deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be installed in two main areas , on the left side the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later used in detail . they represent information about the current piece on each of the different aspects .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might be sure that the sub@@ window has been dropped off . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information in the Statisti@@ cal window will be collected .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the straight running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ters and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this symbol to review the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
to display covers images in the context browser , you need to display the cover images in the same folder as the current piece . file formats . jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display covers images that have been downloaded with the cover administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be immediately play@@ able .
among the recommended pieces are the favour@@ ites of this interpreter . this area shows the five most distinguished pieces of the current interpreter .
you can adjust which information in the music window will be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the interpreter , lists all albums of the current interpreter , which you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text will display the downloaded lyrics for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for writing scripts . once you download the text @-@ window , the text is running out of the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to be started .
the button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collector database . for this , no @-@ run text script is necessary .
the button Search opens a search on google.com to enter a song for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece will be shown directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res will not be ignored .
group interpre@@ ters / Album - first of all , the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ ters , and under it it is made a further distribution after the respective album . if you want to see together naming or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group interpre@@ ters / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the standard 0 - Albu@@ m@@ name is used .
group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically from each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces will first be shown to the genre , and below the performer .
group genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just as the above , but is also sorted by album below the performer .
using the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing completely to Bel@@ i@@ eben and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection as soon as you own some of the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the installation view . indications for the use of this filter is found in the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter out the pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . besides , you can also choose your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically un@@ plug@@ ged .
by clicking with the right mouse button , click on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
loading - this le@@ ert the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play@@ back .
on playlist , filling the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
lines in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to queue for a queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - stores the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name , under which the list is to be saved .
for media players , broadcast the pieces into the queue for transmission to the media player . more details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ ant will burn the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a CD or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
metadata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Public the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) to move files into the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Public a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
compilation mark@@ er - changes as a compilation featured album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the performer .
the playlist browser designed the handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart playlist consists of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even the intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; e.g. iPod ) , with your portable media player ( eg iPod ) , it must be part of the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpre@@ ters in the top of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list of interpre@@ ters . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will end the pieces on your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and dis@@ solve the disk delivery for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area , by which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files are hidden , that don &apos;t match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the File browser , you can select a address bar with which you can select music from an ad URL . if you are using music from an in@@ stituted URL . if you are using music by an ad URL , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can move the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the att@@ achments of files are difficult by simple pit@@ falls . in the case , the cl@@ inging of Shift key can be helpful : by default files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the Mau@@ re@@ base .
the playlist keeps all of you attached pieces . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place and drop . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter , push the back button , until the text@@ box is empty again .
when you enter with spaces separate search words , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; according to entries , all search terms contain . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you are searching for the search terms , will be searched for entries , either the one or the other searches . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , contain the blank spaces , then join the search term with da@@ zz@@ ling : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contains Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you provide a specific search split , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes on Bel@@ i@@ eben . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or have higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can specify the retri@@ bution of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some function of the playlist . on the left side you can add the button , with which you can add the playlist pieces . right next , you will find playlist , playlist , empty and random@@ ly mixing .
next , follow the buttons and re @-@ establish . this allows you to re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ hes rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window above the right mouse button . over this menu you can set &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration setup .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition checks and loud@@ speakers . you can set the buttons buttons by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the play@@ time of all pieces . in addition , the status will be displayed for random mode and play@@ back , a sli@@ der to the play@@ time and repeat the time of the current piece . the status for random mode and re@@ tention is easy to change by clicking with the mouse twice in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . this allows you to display the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu you can click through a click with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the playlist menu . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ in . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
with the menu view you can choose what to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue Administration received your big break in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be playing : 1 will first be played , 2 as a second , and so on .
the maintenance of the queue is open for queu@@ es . if you want to add the queue a bit , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists of which two are already available ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load @-@ load profile to function this dynamic playlist .
click on the playlist you want to click on the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then select store . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist , so you should save the old playlist , under certain circumstances !
the two set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will each add to the next denom@@ ination , so your playlist won &apos;t be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings more dynamic mode . this will be your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button New fill the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the opportunity to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist .
just enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the adjustment for upcoming pieces will be passed and they will be no double in this playlist . if the adjustment is active , the pieces are already removed under consideration the att@@ achments .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the start of playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to playlist . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialogue , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you start several play@@ lists , it is Amar@@ o@@ K ; random pieces from each of the merged play@@ lists will be added .
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ scripts , by installing on the script . after you install the script , a new entry is displayed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button other scripts .
if you do not wish to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please check out scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ in is used for activating the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the cross@@ road next to the name .
this fast guide will show you how to create using &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , create an audio CD . to comprehend the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn a audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , then remember that you &apos;re going to get to MP3 a lower quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ c@@ ect project for this purpose .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this fast guide will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to trace the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; have installed a CD @-@ CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please select extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burning .
once you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog of such or something like that :
in this dialogue window , you can track the progress of the copying process . once the inser@@ tion of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium upon which the data is burned down .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total drop 100 % has reached .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total drop 100 % has reached .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can not find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules do not find . to fix this issue then q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .

if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o : : this program burns audi@@ o- or data @-@ CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also disk @-@ at once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually achie@@ ves &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio data stream . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio converter . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( eg . MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far more developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial entities . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ sy @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder , so that you can read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to unlock WMA files to be inc@@ ent@@ .@@ de@@ co
So@@ x : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats - and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line for video development . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files onto a standard level . this can be useful for example to create pur@@ posed CD &apos;s and MP3 @-@ collections ; without norm@@ alize the different discharge of the different albums at the un@@ attractive effect , the music pieces can be different according to each other .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch from CD and to automatically reproduce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way , recently opened projects re@@ charge . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog is saved , by which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all the opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you want to call it for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and yet it was not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then switch between storing and change . besides , you can also dis@@ rupt the closing and keep the project so open .
exclu@@ des all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all the opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project will be asked , what to happen to happen , as if you were called the file .
when you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you consider the files straight from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; to the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . he arran@@ ges &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import the current project . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you to see the files already existing in the medium and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function arran@@ ges &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , they blind@@ ed only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create a CD from a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only copy one image from a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of buying instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows even without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use the possibility of a DVD instead of normal copying . also , the target medium will be big enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ ists and incre@@ mental .
burns a pre @-@ generated CD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously er@@ set DVD image . the dialog asks you according to a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a pre @-@ loaded DVD movie can be transm@@ uted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be all@@ in@@ activated . it contains information about the illuminated video , coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the specified medium . this information is shown in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ ing of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small list is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
push the folder view , or out . the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , its contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and distor@@ ting the running and throw the medium .
unlock the table view or off . the content is possible to select and pulling files into the project view . the content is also the interface for reading audi@@ o- or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
unlock the copying box in the project view or out . the copying box is a nar@@ ro@@ wer realm , which contains only visible when the project view has open projects . the copying box has no real function , it looks just beautiful and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard agen@@ das for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ note to it further down .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . thus , the proper per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs are set . for this , system administration rights needed , therefore you need to enter the password of the wizard for the system manager ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs may be done . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to be adjusted for the enemy .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ gs ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality could be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in terms of function , hence it is more your taste and the way of your task is vital to which the accompanying program you give .
in this chapter we suppose that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions to use , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b has started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; puts functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and more features for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) F@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) F@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) F@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) F@@ COP@@ Ref . D@@ v@@ d ( ) F@@ ed D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only available on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) contains void Be@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) is void of V@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data @-@ project , multiple folder and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ B@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ tor@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ate@@ l / home / del@@ ity / some@@ fu@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WA@@ V files on the hard drive ) and by many kitchen@@ ettes to default this WA@@ V files ( los@@ ers ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ se@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ sy free compression ) will still be installed from Linux distribution ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read , read and stored in WA@@ V files on the machine ( los@@ sy free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step this WA@@ V files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or other formats such as los@@ s@@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step that read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything themselves . however , only the code that is not used is needed . if , for example , F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ st / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction of co@@ den@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as I said , used &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD sp@@ ection , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; Even not the mechanisms of copying data . avoid simply the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be made ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , about which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can transform into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD : get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby all is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main driver . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the installation of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder has been configured in the tab@@ ular settings in the furniture library - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , allowing the choice to be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it is to be noted that previously the Encoder used in the tab enco@@ ding settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already lit file is selected for code instead of having a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the dialog dialog for the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programmer ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the primary dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss free audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information is losing through data comp@@ osing according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will be less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions free of distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high until very high quality quality ( with high rates of bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG @-@ play@@ equipment is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially in 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et media &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer greater transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate roughly 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and car @-@ stere@@ os@@ ks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
--@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without taking any consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are collected manually or fet@@ ched via the program automatically from the free@@ DB are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names , as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co @-@ operation programs , there is often a combination of programs for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the codes declare the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s should be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ set of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CD to upload the information , so that all the others may download information instead of themselves into the machine . it &apos;s to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the user ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music businesses are inf@@ lic@@ ted . all information can be obtained in case of a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is active to choose an address environment ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address while invo@@ king the data from the server is not used ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if it is designed to use free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally will be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ r@@ ams for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WA@@ V files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in search source ... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done .
to save the illuminated WA@@ V files , the codi@@ le and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at first Open are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a los@@ sy @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the code . other kitchen@@ ettes can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the codi@@ fication is required . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ der window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . in doing so , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reader desires , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio code of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps for average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there have to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame may be found as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can naturally always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have scre@@ ened writing ( eg by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section is the basic frame of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any read &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the used code for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program with , the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet Download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / CD@@ ROM there is a symbolic link to the actual device @-@ drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the mapping card General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only with in@@ completeness information will be selected so that you will be informed when details of the reporting of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the map card ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD have automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine needs to be connected to the Internet for reading the &amp; CD ; to connect to the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the fil@@ esystem or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed by Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this about 6@@ 20 MB large , consider it twice whether this is worth to use free@@ DB at the Off@@ line mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following selection map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load between the machines will be distributed . however , this attitude will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are releasing the protocol 88@@ 80 default , maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to provide any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server forward . the first activation field should be off .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously pay@@ outs : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time are using only an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading the last piece : they cruci@@ fy the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you sign this one , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WA@@ V files is available . if only space is stored on another drive , the files will not be put in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WA@@ V files .
all just enter as it is in the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be attached to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; meeting for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change in tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
the number of WA@@ V files simultaneously : with a dual core or squares , or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than one WA@@ V file can be tried at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic establishment of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; ended . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD . when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , how the process of reading the &amp; CD is run . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard drive is organized , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , must be repeated for any read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a little different from the data required for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , rather than fet@@ ching it from the Internet . comments will point out to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD must now be defined into the press , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , just as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; used as an audio CD ; and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up , successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all songs of the pieces are already filled out , and the name of the artist and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key to your &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry , that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the indication of the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you need the access to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Up@@ eller Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be typ@@ ed in the input field &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ caps per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limit the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum . this option is set up on the tab lab@@ eling settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the code to get more information .
simply select an entry which is apparent with the style of the read CD . in this example , this is not important , as we do not provide the &amp; CD . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are available under skir@@ t .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album are shown on the piece list .
note that it has a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked off . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure all pieces are selected , or pressing the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Find out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is located in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left section of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you &apos;re trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , follow and code parallel . notice the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have configuration settings to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that can be configured is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in weak machines , the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem with simultaneous expression and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is on the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will keep you entertained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the col@@ lateral media package . however , if you are using CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already included in a pre @-@ compiled package ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it ...
this section is directed to individuals who compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance as to how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different mapping cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program , without any clue as it is going to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is all about it ? who reads this , probably has started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot sustain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; audi@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . whoever tries to add or change it . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange if you succeeded to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke gam@@ ers of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has not got some properties with real @-@ time and kar@@ a@@ oke Real@@ ms of texts also some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so should work on all systems with OS@@ S - and &amp; k@@ de ; it also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound proj@@ ector , which is required for the CIS . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI @-@ channel through the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can draw in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window windows to the cap can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song@@ writer or text events ) . K@@ mid will automatically determine the used procedure .
seating support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; finish during the play@@ back of a song , K@@ Mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , a@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also let a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and bed the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece or pressing the blank button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play@@ back each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and forth .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the temp@@ o display and so change the conversion speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space @-@ button has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space button or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , so interrup@@ ts play@@ back . if you play the space @-@ button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; die play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textiles , others use song@@ writing and again others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype will automatically identify which a song has to be selected , so you do not have to select the kar@@ a@@ oke text automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this , if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype , select from the menu settings the entries of text and song@@ events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summar@@ ize . these will be played by series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to put a collection , open first the collection manager . find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the requested information in the collection manager .
to the temporary collection all songs you want to not want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . keep in mind when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button . once again , the file dialogue will be able to choose the one you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic additions to the collection .
if automatic added to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using File Open or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic added to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and , this collection will then continue to be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager to choose the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs are re@@ played . if you choose the series to choose from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song further , choose the next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button right .
to jump back a song vice versa , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece out of the menu piece or press the button left .
to clear a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and click the button Dele@@ te .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when the piano should play a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl. a@@ we - and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all the needed compositions for the play@@ back of a piece .
each section is allowed to appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is to have a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as E @-@ Mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be available for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI appear on your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left @-@ left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM will be in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . to make this enter the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ enses ) , it takes less 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different per@@ us@@ sion@@ ment ( drums , basin , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one where the tone is the pitch of always the same dru@@ mm@@ ers ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P segment , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used mainly to form notes on the screen TV channel . take a look at the key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , simply make it easy in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P segment .
however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is pic@@ tured on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file name . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , more and more patch x uses .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the be@@ ater patch on the screen on the screen .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates whether a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value , this is rec@@ alled to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only then transmitted . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file there are no dec@@ imal mas .
this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch format with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ ons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ atures see what sounds are played on .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t have any more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views in order to show the mir@@ r@@ ored tones . view in the menu settings below the point of the channel view : setting
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed when playing a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a tru@@ sting distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without a@@ we support compiled . to remove the problem you need to download an source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
do not agree to &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic added to the collection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the collection , otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can click the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the play@@ back . to re@@ activate the standard temp@@ o , you can double click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I have to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; drag window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen quickly a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic adding to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so place the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ E. to your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then unlock yourself , play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a little time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a little time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files make music and prove things .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your residence or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you will be able to contact me . before you want to contact me , as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get enough money to anyone . I want to stress that I only get more programmed , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Expl@@ oring the error , that the key @-@ height at a@@ we cards was too high .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Die@@ fen@@ cing , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Peter Cor@@ it@@ sch , Peter Cor@@ it@@ sch , Peter Cor@@ it@@ sch , Peter Cor@@ respon@@ ds , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or just a supportive email .
and of course my thanks also to all of these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the home page you can watch the development , find information and look at photos . you will also find links to sites with further kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends substantially on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM @-@ device or a a@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card except that you can not listen to any music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ players , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for play@@ back video files of M@@ player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as play@@ back DVD s , V@@ CD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ Name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The KDE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . in addition , there is always the window with the playlist . finally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the prefer@@ ential connections with the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played by each other , you should use the category continuous playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical memory . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos;s current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist files can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can change the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / , but also by the application itself . to simply click on a name of a category click , there@@ from the menu view and next editing mode . through the cli@@ cks of a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose the same with playlist , or choose another category , or another category will be chosen .
all changes are lost if the disk mode are left or a different group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and turning can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / export / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at star@@ ten does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would bother at the end @-@ animation , however , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the player and the cache size of the fil@@ esystem from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played for the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
hence the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages may be able to reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type B / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file allocation of KDE .
the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can start in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console on the context menu ) .
thus getting a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ IM@@ E type ( obviously only if this has been identified ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ em@@ phon@@ em@@ wrote all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV Cards , either using the player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner device and TV channels need to be configured . to this , the scanner is used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is to use dialog in settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one selected enco@@ ding must be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B contained therein .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only available on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux will need to function in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by KM@@ players for the sources different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this will be dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ d@@ scanner , t@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hint like I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is to run as user root after adding the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / CD@@ ROM displays on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts to start slowly , why every time my CPU has to be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ Player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ t : : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user surfaces and network support and will be needed for compile &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to run on the package &amp; texts ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be attracted .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; web page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; kis@@ ses ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users should hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact information on the ki@@ le should be made .
if you have any questions or if you are looking for &amp; ki@@ le ; or if you wish , this should be addressed to the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ area for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , delay and fault tools for this . finally called are the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities to learn the manual should be made to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter on the Editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; l@@ atex ; the proper pron@@ unciation is : L@@ ay @-@ TECH ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; a less demanding but more realistic Er@@ mit@@ ter is that it deri@@ ves from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
to say here only a good amount of view to &amp; l@@ atex ; it is not the ultimate book to be able to be able to master properly , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

exactly the same as other mark@@ ers said &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the general characteristics such as paper format , number of numbers and text files are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction starts at least the command \ \ by { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ by { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an exact function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
documentation : this is called the type of document document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ape &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ape &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; C@@ amer &#93; , slides , or custom .
coding : this is used for the coding of the system . modern systems should use increasingly the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for inclusion , they are only rated in the cross@@ fire .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document categories of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the application of german texts .
new users now do not have to worry about . it is a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; a simple troubles@@ hooting is not closed . however , you should have noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of output file .
with automatic ampli@@ fication of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank lines ( to enter the text ) and the associated line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ by { Command } ) . this function can be ki@@ cked in the men@@ ue settings ; set ... La@@ Te@@ X commands disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . l@@ atex ; sub@@ mitting the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful . once a DV@@ I ; -@@ file has been created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer for the appropriate line in the l@@ atex ; -@@ source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and other information such as font , or l@@ atex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and smell .
when using the RO@@ I file , the elements of the DV@@ I ; -@@ file ch@@ opped with the editor and as soon as an element in the DV@@ I ; source code is embro@@ i@@ dered , the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the l@@ atex ; source code has been clicked , becomes the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; viewers .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document is set to set up project settings .
high @-@ speed : the l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code exist ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file will be used on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is not a call of &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the quick installation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when contempl@@ ating the edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ of @-@ the selected elements of the document should be developed for the fast delivery of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... the sub @-@ adjustable &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the drop @-@ down box is for the addition of articles such as tags , fox , notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection a selection field ) .
when using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; the author can be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ out with the name Gra@@ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font . it can be defined as the main text , the Fu@@ els banknotes , etc . it is the following sizes to apply :
when you call &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2. the document can be written from scratch .
brack@@ ets after the command \ \ of the class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; establishes the font . if the font should not be set at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the above source code sample has to be entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of the button .
the source code must be stored before the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage is automatically saved .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fail , should be searched for errors in the log process . when using quick installation , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be noted .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font should have been created . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ by { environment } .
the types are only available within the area ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no sign@@ post ( number ) for the type inside an environment .
there are many possibilities to educate the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can , for example , certain fon@@ ts , li@@ ft@@ ment , cou@@ pl@@ ings , sub@@ missions , etc. in the end of the environment . these commands either end with the \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course pressure and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ by { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to write the source code with the l@@ atex ; -@@ pron@@ unciation , follows now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once assistant was typ@@ ed a bit text , a few adap@@ tations to the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . at least one quote , a few places in the fat and cou@@ rier pressure and a poem come to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l may return to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply test and fun .
DV@@ I ; is an additional file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ado ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Um@@ wand@@ ler or computer screen monitors .
for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar set the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; -@@ file was created from the l@@ atex ; -@@ source code can begin the conversion in penetr@@ ated other formats by means of the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
explore the direct jump from the editor to the actual position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Bin@@ z files . for this purpose only Modern is set up under settings Ki@@ le ... tools are needed .
to look for the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and will be clicked on for@@ s@@ lick on preferences . the jump to the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; viewers will then be done .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; shall be drawn up and the corresponding line . to this end , &amp; ki@@ le ; used as a text editor ( settings O@@ ep@@ ie@@ ve ... Editor )
if the activation of quick ac@@ ulture of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers do not wish to have a mistake . if a mistake has been made , it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary .
the log file indicates the error source in the source code . in the editor you can refer to the errors in which the error appears . in order to view the faul@@ ty line must be clicked on the error in the log file and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the possibilities presented are :
when selecting a piece of document , a document can either be written or used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section .
household users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are allowed in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file format or a new file must be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template using a file , some string qu@@ ettes will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing ) . these variables can be set in settings Ki@@ le ... Settings
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering documents . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps has been taken :
when creating a new document , you can create a template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any one &amp; l@@ atex ; a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are available .
&amp; ki@@ le ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor of many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for
to learn more about Kate ; and his opportunities to learn the manual should be attracted at Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter on the Editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may find an adequate description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button to train the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way the clicking on \ \ \ by \ \ \ \ \ are merely \ \ par .
when pulling the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker button , the text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with penetr@@ ated Shift key , parts of the source code can be washed out in the editing window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; it has the ability to browse various kinds of source tex@@ as and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants can be included in the text box . these are your own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the jumping mat or the corresponding jumping brand . thereby , this jump brand is highlighted , so that it is automatically displayed in the first entry of a character .
the mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although Kate ; excellent features for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source texts have always been added ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text output :
w@@ aged a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text associated with per@@ tin@@ ent lines ( as in other text @-@ dit@@ ches ) . this advanced meaning may not be taken from the source using tables , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is thus that the sections are separated by two blank lines .
if the word is under the current curr@@ y@@ position . this selection has also an advanced meaning , since this command will also l@@ atex ; commands with a beautiful star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) .
for example a part of the document can be removed from above all , and by drama the button de@@ f is removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the entire line removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands , for example , the following commands are included in the text :
del@@ etes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is contained in the description of mach@@ ining in paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fies that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; available NF more commands under mach@@ ining space for easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command is embro@@ i@@ dered to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the surrounding area .
with this command is embro@@ i@@ dered to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the area .
if the cursor before or within the command \ \ begin of the environment } , becomes the end of the area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many tra@@ ine@@ ated Environ@@ ment@@ ing commands can quickly be lost to the highest view . this command fell asleep most of the last , so that the left @-@ left ambient structure is not being distor@@ ted .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the l@@ atex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from mach@@ ining environment .
with this command to the start of the current group is embro@@ i@@ dered ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the wei@@ ghted cl@@ amp .
with this command to the end of the current group is embro@@ i@@ dered ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the sli@@ der cl@@ amp .
if the cursor before or behind the wei@@ rd cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many tra@@ ine@@ ated groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly be lost to the highest view . this command fell the last cooked group , so the van@@ ished structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not being dis@@ missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; for the purpose of purpose , the sign will be used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; becomes the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and apply two @-@ to @-@ bed acc@@ ents for &amp; l@@ atex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double , can be set under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and fl@@ aged .
there are many other languages also available ( eg . n@@ ese or French ) and thus German or fran@@ chis@@ may be used . there are also many other languages available .
in the Dr@@ Ã ¼ hr@@ ams of Shift ; input taste . if the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. enumer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is , for example , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a row @-@ change but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , you can have slept &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an o@@ bo@@ ating line departure .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments to support . these can be added to settings .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) to each other . if this Tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ verse , for example , and ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current t@@ abo@@ o .
although &amp; Kate ; already developed a good source code trans@@ cription , these two modes ( usually for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still expanded . there are three according to requirements and the other two are for automatic reliability . all these modes can be set for different ways of working under settings Ki@@ le .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ by { surroundings } after an empty line ( for text ) .
in the Dr@@ Ã ¼ cke of the R@@ Ã ¼ button , the last letter of the input is removed and will be confused by the default list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering an additional letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; ki@@ le ; even diving brands will be introduced , so that a simple jump to these positions by editing ank@@ h@@ est jumping mat is possible and the parameters used can then be frozen .
under settings ki@@ le ; furn@@ ish ... ki@@ le ; they can be done to these lists . you can choose different types of designs , and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as we@@ aves of the general language @-@ to @-@ use .
the command mode is not available for performing environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of trans@@ cription mode will result in a large list of ambient mode . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments to be executed .
with the call of the trans@@ location mechanism or the keyboard short@@ cut mode , the command will be frozen automatically and it appears to \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient can be continued in the easiest way and through drama the input will be stopped .
once this has accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list of surroundings , it is even a first \ \ item command with frozen .
under settings ki@@ le ; furn@@ ish ... ki@@ le ; adjustments can be made for these lists . this mode uses the partial list of the default mode for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations which can immediately be replaced by default string . the lists can be set up under settings ki@@ le . as an example of a breakdown list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , included , for example , included the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X for example .
is inserted , for example , the letter L input and the word comple@@ tes the men@@ acing mode , or the keyboard short@@ cut mode is introduced , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large ones are not helpful for automatic reliability . however , it has been determined that many mar@@ es in a document can be written more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the exp@@ ir@@ ation for all is already written .
this mode can set up in the men@@ ù Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set off . here , the corpor@@ a value can be determined for the display of completion .
the trans@@ cription files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the usual home folder . mode is available for use ( breakdown ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed the addition of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the basics to graphics , the sections should be he@@ eded and observed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for the documents and re@@ arrangement of pages . will use the PDF output , so you can re @-@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools to be re @-@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to examine the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for be@@ viewer such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used the keyboard . after that , the DV@@ I ; -@@ file can be converted to a PS @-@ file and be viewed by the old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command @-@ building , it is usually called a spect@@ ator after comp@@ iling . should not be used in a wi@@ red observer , so each time becomes a new window .
a new project is asked for the project of New Project .... in this context , the following information is asked for the project :

often work on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the information of team members and those can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leader and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user may pick yourself out of the list of the members of the team who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and the button replace the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text .
nickname and setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information .
in addition to an overview of her team there is another advantage by collecting members of the team : it can be an event for information about the team manager when something specific occurs . see in for more information .
event actions are promotions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be seen how much someone has worked on , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script written a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page of event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialogue can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i will be appointed to such director .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
type comments is easy . there may be either the comment -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by the following text .
note can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax of the previous nickname of the team member states is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head Sub@@ project leader After the tyres and sub@@ project leaders should be introduced as in the following examples below .
nickname and cast@@ es names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d .

the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a brief description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by using settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; regarding tags including car @-@ communication can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / small spelling of tags : large / mini@@ ature of automatically assigned tags . normal young / mini@@ ature means the tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small spelling of attributes : large / small spelling of automatically assigned attributes . normal young / small spelling means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if cancelled , is optional for tags , for which the next day is optional , this immediately after breakfast .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
start @-@ up and finish @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the corresponding coding during entry .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . by using the Standard play@@ back , the standard features can be recovered .
standard enco@@ ding : coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) . however , this attitude here is ex@@ iled from the same in the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . however , this attitude here will be derived from the same in the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that with a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored by this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for even stored documents , a backup is regularly created , accordingly .
the preview and documentation may be displayed either in the editing area or in their own view ( or the documentation in a diagram ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window @-@ settings back to the default back next time is useful when the user interface has come through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes , and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views each other . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout @-@ line parameters .
the warm feed@@ backs section serves the tax of the possibility to eliminate the display of warnings by att@@ ackers of no more inqu@@ ire .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be specified the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , will be adjusted in details .
in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the ri@@ ddle dissolved by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ slip action .
in the structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ ality of the tree in mach@@ ining and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such as the current document has not been found .
the area to commemor@@ ate abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are deduc@@ ted in editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s that means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be given the following :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not in a standard there as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the proj@@ ections .
component in &quot; Simp@@ ly &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the given information is correct . pick @-@ up the entry also , if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gger was completely new . Die@@ support for the no longer necessary built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Debug@@ ger was set , so as the support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger Plugin was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins .
currently there is only a plugin available that adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings may be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; UI :
a view in which the contents of embedded variables is displayed . usually , in the left bank .
a view in which all the items , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually , in the lower dock .
a view in which the debu@@ gger issue is displayed ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger is necessary , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , that a debu@@ gger is not required to be respected .
the counter@@ part to debu@@ gging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to direct the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger issue .
indicates the debu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the surveillance variables as well as the currently executed line continuously . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution continued . happens before a de@@ bug request was started , the script starts with the requirement .
indicates the debu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script without sending information to the variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution runs , starts execution as soon as a requirement is made .
the debu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or features .
the debu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes it will be rede@@ emed .
indicates the debu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next so if there would be the current one .
opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ hau@@ led value appears in the variation view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs , and how you can help them better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car completion and no@@ dal trees ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and / CSS ; s . D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ box . tag tool@@ ing are handmade , symbolic @-@ oriented legends of images ( above the Edi@@ ting window ) , which can insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create the XML files then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ ing . in short , an &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ alo@@ ges , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day showing the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ ing enable a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without any danger of writing .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . you only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the chec@@ ker language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and de@@ kl@@ ari@@ ed if they are necessary or not . although not all is necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is set out in an easier way .
this is the root element of a meeting document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but as only element type is nothing else than anything else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for day type is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Commons Attri@@ but@@ ing group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag determined . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only happen once for any attribute . in addition , there are other tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a single element type element .
returns the source used for filling the source code for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology name . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag , this means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ tag group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for one attribute description only once . it is a just @-@ element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day may occur for any attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : ... ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be gre@@ ased and closed properly .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; symbols . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will make no leg change , but some pieces of work would disappear .
for checking the day XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check our X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the examination occurs only at loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this equ@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function described . the file name of this conference file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / day &gt; &amp; quot ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor available via D@@ T@@ D &apos;s D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , the des@@ crip@@ tional r@@ c can be edited . when editing a &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , should be a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tional r@@ c ; should be prepared with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = usage 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action of the short@@ cut short@@ cut . with clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Even are the Quick start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
the first must be given the name of the script and the interpreter . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / Net@@ anta / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; it will be replaced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the aforementioned methods , a script can take part of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default input . in the selection field input can be determined what is to send to default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to input can also be diver@@ ted to the output of the specified application . there are two types of issue : normal issue , directed to default output ; it can be specified what is to happen to the default output written , by set the value the drop @-@ out issue :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to set the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable dialogue &quot; day edit &quot; when available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action represents better , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , chart other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starter button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least to be sign@@ aled a message to the user that application of this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag in the current document will insert .
after the creation of the symbol there is still to be connected to the action . this is going through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is one button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the applied button and continue using other tags , so there are still which , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions on tool@@ bar or it should be provided for better overview through some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ box set dialog on settings tool . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proo@@ fing of all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user the opportunity to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository If anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then you need to let the do@@ cr@@ c file . let &apos;s let the second part we treat you here .
# KDE configuration file ( Tree &#93; Doc you = path , relatively to this file , to the document@@ ations of text files e.g. by Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1 html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 10.@@ 4.@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 10.@@ 0 = Sec@@ tion@@ 10.@@ 4.@@ 2.2 = = tag # 1 = tag 1.@@ html 5 = day@@ . html 1 = day@@ . html 5 = day@@ .
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now look at the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level of the Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of content = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... Basic Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess room ( apart from reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently logical at the top end of the component view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; symbols . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources and resources are replaced .
the content section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be shown on the design of the context sensitive help . by flag@@ ging the function and drag of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file mandatory .
a simple list of by ben@@ ign separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c on your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / Net@@ anta / doc / crop / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and well worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation were used at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich@@ ly rich , but proud to have worked with the best web develop@@ ement platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the disp@@ ens@@ er resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email sending menus , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send an e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users will be reviewed and made available only when our team needs them as accurate and use@@ fully for publishing . to make an easy contribution to what there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later user .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can have a look out . in the dialogue New resource need to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and hit the up@@ loading of OK the up@@ loading .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree are started .
after downloading a resource , nor before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package will be necessary because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in the day @-@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started by the D@@ T@@ D shop and converting a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . then , the following dialogue will appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that will appear in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ dt@@ d
tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , bringing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one must first teach them these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ect@@ . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; uses , available . of tool@@ ing about promotions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to provide different tool@@ ing , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then available everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ ing . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tools with special actions specifically reserved for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns made by all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the building views , the car@@ lo@@ dges with information and the tool@@ ing . please hit in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the car@@ o @-@ leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentary entries , such as close the current , other or all carto@@ onist , re@@ up@@ loading , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing of the mouse under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file when the string are referred to as a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ einer there is the tool@@ tip of the Edi@@ tors . at present &amp; C@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool tools is demonstrated . in the course of further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ tool will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document then click on the symbol that the tag represents . if they want to insert the data for this straight day . if they want to insert the data for this straight ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the builders ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and wander . in the presentation with car@@ lo@@ aders are available for files , project , model documents , documentation , attributes , and documentation components .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed with the click context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it offers all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . the right mouse button includes further functions , such as the script to start , edit or send e @-@ mail .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open .
this tree appears under the other building views . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces may change . the result is the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ pac@@ ed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to create a document on a project , and by adding a folder doc , a project may be added , edited and looked at .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two car@@ edi@@ ers at the bottom of the window , via the beneficial information can be achieved : the news window and the problem window .
this carto@@ onist displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D will be displayed .
this car@@ o @-@ maker displays all errors in the up @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that will be executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Tool@@ kit are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate site of tool@@ ing is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as zi@@ pped T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can make it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as any other secure and download !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adjust to auto@@ conf file on your system . to get a complete list of all options , give . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I am folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimised for a rapid web development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; to create the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a peculiar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up Language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
it is no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Sc@@ ope is not only this possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it to their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to make use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program , they can make it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web develop@@ mental environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast design development and quickly became a well @-@ designed editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; C@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template , only a bug will be reported .
conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board contained there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ write so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of form .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ letter which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
locks the block@@ ers to or from . this allows you to choose text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script errors are out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with the GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the news window to or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and debu@@ gger .
initial and switching of the problem @-@ up on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; main driver . the problem @-@ re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the agent in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file @ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
the project directory searches for new files that could be there . that allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
setting , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the Project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details declared .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu when you have allocated them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that &apos;s created just the name . actions must be added by means of settings . tool@@ ing are saved over tool tool@@ ing , or you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ box .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete them from your hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
with this you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; -@@ team to allow the tool@@ bar available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows to upload tool to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
load one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is sensible when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this is global and a writing table in the global KDE folder is not present , the charging does not fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) Tool@@ bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or disable the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by means of tool@@ bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug @-@ ins listed under the above mentioned menu items are activated . click . click on a activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it .
select the syn@@ ony@@ ms mode for the current file . the list of available entry schem@@ ata depends on der@@ min@@ ate ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application of tidy .
immediate det@@ aching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the revers@@ al sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . recommended is the display card mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting a single one , the corresponding sub@@ window is enabled .
switches the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; head@@ stones at or off .
the changes in this dialog affect every application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
directed the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ einer . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ box or which can change and modify the sequences .
this should create an aid in accordance with the model of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as after filling out the project named the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard will be set .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ kit are stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . when a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard will be set .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this attitude is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files are to be integrated somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started anew . if a project is started from scratch , not appealing .
with this option all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of app@@ ra@@ ils .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by means of attachment , or by removing the tick @-@ chambers from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded with project properties in the men@@ ace window in the sub@@ window , or using the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which can be viewed newly in project @-@ related operations such as proj@@ ections .
supple@@ mental option too above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project is loaded and more about project views can be read .
the debu@@ gger can be chosen . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information on Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in case the debu@@ gger is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be adjusted , as well as the display of a component view for the content of the server for each profile , by displaying an own component view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list , see the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch to event actions and add these actions , change or delete . events actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs , such as the si@@ ders of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at the moment .
to open a different project , select a project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog &apos;s dialog is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project structure gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening ... in with the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the files up@@ loaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will stop down to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten by program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password on the plate does not appear in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high profile profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied , either a fully @-@ qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it cannot be easily read , but each with programming language can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ ing . there can be a lot of views in a project , i.e. , by simple exchange of view , multiple files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ ing .
views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool tool@@ bar , or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which you most have to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also enables the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ ing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best about the menu tool@@ bar . use and add add to add Tool@@ kit will be handled below in the section adding .
the tool@@ ing and the icons can be set in either using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action tool@@ bar , other actions like tool@@ bar can remove , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bar set out , which can be specified in dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will also remove the entries and processed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ ing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ ing ... to set up settings .
templates are essentially document @-@ reduced , code car@@ ving and files for short@@ cuts . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or move into the system &apos;s existing directory in the template . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set up for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms used at the beginning of each template , prior to using it .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . for more information about the templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . it makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organising the work in a proper way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information about templates tree .
this kind templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area always should be inserted in the documents . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about templates tree .
as its name says , these templates will serve for entire websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a zi@@ pped tar archive . at present there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as a template as a local template ....
once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template among project templates .
select text in your document and click on file as a template store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with dra@@ gging and deri@@ ve into the designs .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a template folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and deri@@ ve or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on the file tree or in the repository files to create a folder on the right and backup site template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , create files or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things in dealing with templates , in projects very profound .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files created in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / rectangular / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / templates /
to set the behaviour of a folder in the template review , with the right mouse button , click the folder and choose in the context menu characteristics . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is dis@@ band@@ ed as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes is hal@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and fit for everything except the regular folders . if a master folder would be set in principle , unless they were explicitly activated . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ stone . if nothing appears , you probably find themselves in a regular folder .
allows you to set up or set up text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying content into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate Head@@ lines / Head@@ lines .
in addition , you have the right @-@ click menu ( indicating your right mouse button ) on a full command collection of folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that covers the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch when needed to the source code , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; config editor is already active , this mode is already active , the key@@ press puts the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source Editor is set to set about settings Qu@@ anta . by selecting V@@ PL ; for selection , you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation is to be adjusted for fast computers and a big span@@ ish for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools to choose document properties . thus , the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to change the suspension of suspension . thus , one can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search@@ engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons on the list or delete . a change about the list is accurate as with the Met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style by clicking on the file @-@ opening button and selecting the corresponding file .
the use of the agent is as usual in a text processing , due to account with the arrows , possible . at rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and delete or removing taste .
the inser@@ ting of tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ box , as in the source code editor . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags previously already existing identical tags not removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded by text , everyone needs to be removed each other um@@ ber anchor day .
some tool modes such as the tables assistant or the lists are de@@ activated . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists are to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style of style can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need out &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

there are many graphic tools for comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the compilation was very complicated , because one of the most frequent changes made and simultaneously corrected to many places the reverse . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a number of conflicts throughout .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the back @-@ back had changed . that &apos;s the result of these changes was a small nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a row and make changes to white character . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and composite of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way guide will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons independently manage each other at a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to solve conflict and demonstrates the result at the same time . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assembled :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and in this way the possibilities of current colour monitors . if you often need co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance on the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anger more , if someone changes the capture . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all the files are the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the ti@@ p@@ side by just writing the file name in the first file . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder @-@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ inary Ex@@ ner@@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder @-@ folder
opening dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames containing the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a most recently opened file from the list . you do not have to specify third file ; if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences is performed with two files .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge from folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if it is merged , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file . you can also finish this step later when saving .
the direct button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening @-@ dialog , you will need to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and dra@@ gging , just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to load only two appropriate files , put them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , paste and then compare .
note : currently you can &apos;t pull anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text is supported in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program as compensation and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) . ( when the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three source sets are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preference settings can be changed by the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color that file differs . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( bring together ) well .
links next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programmers , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + for example , white signs only appear in strings and comments , for the ser@@ essor and in a few , seldom items relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the merger column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ change is activated , the line is displayed on a broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison table ) also has a info line with the wording : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; geography &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic running already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ inge to next to stem / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
when only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also indicate a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group becomes the current group of background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes , through automatic edit or through manual editing no more line is left in the group ; then this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might want to copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; conver@@ ts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go gently with this function .
note : if you choose the sources to ignore or ignore the Options / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating is mainly associated with the pictures and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , high , down , page on , page starting , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the Over@@ view column can also be used by clicking also to the Navig@@ ate .
in the window window , you can also use the other keys for editing . using the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ board mode . ( default , the insert mode is set . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the conc@@ aten@@ ate columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section and explains the editing window ) .
the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Fig@@ ures / Str@@ g @-@ Fig@@ ure ) or the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Fig@@ ures ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all not automatically solved conflicts also after the manual , therefore needs to be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ ts ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual . be careful with this option , as you might accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Shows are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a new@@ line sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car @-@ re@@ plen@@ ishment \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 retains the line of the source files not with , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved when starting , and the next start is restored . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ wid@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides ty@@ pe@@ faces with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen document does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be rep@@ lic@@ ated . on these systems , the button preferences automatically shows an un@@ just color .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ular character will be inserted .
when you press the input or return , the filing of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is copying into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which pointer type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when combined , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon mark &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ use &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ use , but then files might be activated with different sizes in side @-@ on @-@ side comparison , though they might be different . if this option must be de@@ activated , however , this option must be disabled . in default , this option must be disabled .
in default this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and per@@ tin@@ ent characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences will nevertheless be displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white character .
intensive looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and big files , but slowly with very big files .
in the auto @-@ jump mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
does automatic all conflicts arise in white signs by using the selected file as a source . ( submitted is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need to use this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or have enabled Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on sc@@ anning from folders and circul@@ ating of a compilation . see for details under the documentation for the directory @-@ comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ log file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set over there over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you have enabled this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding appears a short notice , which is local coding . ( this can not be modified here and has for you purely informal nature . )
adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting it . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
once you have edited a file , you can specify which coding for storing ought to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing instructions , you might not be able to function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the editor @-@ in command can only use with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ editor .
turn this off to sup@@ press Her@@ vor@@ ings of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing figures or enabled Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . after a selection of A &amp; lt ; s ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ s ; C , or B , gt ; C will be shown next to the normal nor a second check @-@ in column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important windows . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
type the same window next to each other or over@@ throwing . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide how to merge the files together . a simple click will also compare two files . ( when this function is used to restart the file name , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the instruction is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preference , which is exactly your needs . you can use this function e.g. to cut trouble @-@ breaking parts or to correct the capture .
when reading a file , they will first be handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the edition of the instruction is used only when the command is used . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that is exactly your needs . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program the self . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l fully suff@@ ice .
use this pre @-@ editor for drawing up in large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ 1 / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ 1 in the creation string , the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text into upper case letters .
therefore , CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert text chains ( info : / CV@@ S / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ _ BAR \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; s list . the \ \ &apos; s $ \ &apos; is needed because $ is a special sign and end of line .
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ wid@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example of another test editor for drawing ab@@ net@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each matches will be replaced by nothing , so be quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the settings from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement &apos; aller@@ dings are needed at per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the set &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and managing . further operations only alter the data that the line @-@ off @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can change .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ up pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder can be compared and merged .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate this can sim@@ ulate and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without really perform them ,
... results selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar . you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , then Ord@@ inary folder is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match this together , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during the filing of the folder you will inform a small news window on the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only files are listed , which were compared to that time .
when sc@@ anning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
every file and any folder that has been found during the scan will be presented here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking on the object to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and list all sub@@ directories with which you can catch all the folders and folders .
click on a file , the file will be started and there will be a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the dates in the first folder ( a ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in the different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the contrac@@ eption action cannot be automatically selected , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above image , you are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical deposits , the colour is also identical even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then the folder also have the same color . at folders , the age is un@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow gets yellow , and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy from C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
the mode to sync is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are used . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the result is copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option will be activated instead of plug@@ ging ( unsure ) , then the same date appears , then the same date appears . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the folder cannot be started .
while the result will merge a file after the other . it &apos;s status column shows Finish one when the result was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other reports , when something failed . if the result is completed , you should make a final review and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog , the file comparative analysis is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 more columns is displayed . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for rede@@ emed conflicts is displayed only when three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can merge either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all contrac@@ ep@@ stakes ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run it together .
please note : if you have no target folder , then three @-@ folder mode will be used as a target in three @-@ folder mode , B is selected as a target and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to run all entries : select directory @-@ guide / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) only to run the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting data types still exist invali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options depar@@ ting , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting .
select Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without the actual changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then results certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window will open ( check the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to the problem .
if some entries have been individually merged , note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it when later , all entries have been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries are again merged .
the settings @-@ menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ illing 3 ... ) has now a section called directory @-@ assemb@@ ling with these options :
only files that fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folders do not correspond to that pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files are a trans@@ verse attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a forward point . a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in the default .
on Links to Files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default setting .
with links to the folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not check on possible recur@@ ren@@ cies . a link to a folder of a link itself would lead to an end @-@ loop , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
when you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare the amendment date and file size . however , this speed is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is down@@ stream in the default setting .
similarly as confidential the chan@@ gel date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical . that can be useful when copying the amendment date has been lost . please use caution . this option is down@@ stream in the default setting .
enabled the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions are being identical to that both folder are identical . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uncertain as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original backup file will already exist with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in the default .
usually the folder @-@ merge contents are visible to the merge individual files ; you can switch to the window @-@ divi@@ ders with the mouse . if you do not want to share the window list window and change the main window in the window menu and switch the change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking on . however , you can create a single file directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be brought together once you run the folder .
this status will however be lost if you check the directory again : list menu : new read
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be trained . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank lines &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it may not be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change of change from the original . ( note the option tru@@ sting the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main uses is currently known as the distinc@@ tions of viewers in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in @-@ built differences in the viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference between the viewer and then select In K@@ id 3@@ Part display in the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ illing 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files has changed since the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part of being executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs for quite a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who go this way or going to go this way .
you have notified the program from the sources and the configure script probably not notify the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration , configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( eg . k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered to be not identical . IF similar lines of the next to each other , this net@@ is , but this is the case of the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is lost though , if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is much effort to design extra its own file format which could save this information .
the effort for this was too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to deal with larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c linear ; released and the text does not allow itself to delete . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to distinguish from differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from game Wild Web . thank you !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
for more information on how to use K@@ wid@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
for a list of the latest changes you will find below htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; compile and install on a system using &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current disk position or replaces the current mark@@ er .
display just differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the target folder .
( in the current version of the program you will have to update the folder with the function Re@@ fresh ) after changes to these options . )
there are only entries to display the differences . that also results in the target folder . if the target folder these files does not already contain , they are missing after that . ( the behavior will be altered in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on the selection of the source with let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed while clicking the button .
in default this option is down@@ lighted . Under@@ standing in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white character .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini@@ show of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop surfaces , to change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moves on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move window within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; moving . the movement is possible within a desktop and other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; chew@@ ing , the context menu has only compiled two entries in P@@ ager . if , however , the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries will be minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , ups and representations . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
if this cros@@ sover is marked , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is displayed ; the names of the virtual work surfaces are shown .
indicate this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work surfaces . is it together with name to display , the names will be supplied with folder , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are shown to enable their selection .
here is selected the view of the program window . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program module . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is determined : classic makes &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , as well as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other wind@@ ow@@ man@@ ners ; wa@@ thes shows all virtual work areas in a horizont@@ ally and vertically positioned in a vertical range , which is very good for the viewing on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager : can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the check@@ bar . it has the advantage that it can be altered in the size , display the window as symbols or with its content and can move outside the check@@ bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection from the switch devices ... allows the dialog settings to appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in dialog settings : but you can manually do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ alo@@ gu@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit card ; or V@@ I. If you do not have writing permission for the file , you need to register as a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you must insert the key wind @-@ transparent fashion and assign this to a value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE packages .

&amp; kis@@ sed ; is a screen saver . you can enlarge with &amp; kis@@ sing ; a part of the screen . this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; kis@@ sed .
&amp; kis@@ sed ; is a very powerful application which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful machines .
when you like , start a window like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fier window . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting aug@@ mentation &amp; kis@@ sed ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable len@@ upe . alternatively , you can create a selected display area in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg , on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse @-@ cursor . please note that the mouse @-@ cursor is currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse @-@ cursor . this is always the standard box ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the larger window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with the arrows .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ pit stops and only the bottom left corner is to move .
&amp; ... has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy a file to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . the plug @-@ up of the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , means , stool , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required .

&amp; k@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse @-@ cursor a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and each mouse @-@ click hurt .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and each mouse @-@ click hurt . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this does require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; can handle the pain that comes with the mouse on the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also cause pain that are connected with the use of your computer , you should have a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clarify things once more : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain that helps when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the mouse due to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the outcome can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the movement out .
is the intelligent de@@ activation power , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; a break after getting the mouse button down . move the mouse , waiting until the end of the mouse , before the slogan means exec@@ uting the mouse button . this smart moving requires a little practice , but you get used quickly on it .
this ref@@ usal time has to be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; a single mouse click .
if smar@@ ter switched on , the turn@@ around is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; after downloading the mouse button , after downloading the mouse button , no account for the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; now its function is activated , generates a slow payment because of right and back , followed by a break , by a click with the right mouse button . a slow way for left and back leads a double mou@@ sec@@ lick . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound falls out , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to move the reaction time to shor@@ ten . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you can set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setup is marked , it will run &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently available only under &amp; k@@ de ; please drag the respective documentation to the rate to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings to the values returned when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed down the button , the settings will be put back to the status of the last drop of application .
the best to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; first of all use the default settings . in particular , the intelligent de@@ port should be switched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart t@@ anning .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds too .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to un@@ known reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ gged , you should clean your mouse . it is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse @-@ ball but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , it varies from mouse to mouse . but it should be quick if you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily be scr@@ ap@@ ed with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the design of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; if just a move started out . if you would like to use the intelligent de@@ port , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation is no longer due to the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse @-@ click . this is set back by the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it . but don &apos;t leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to create a keyboard short@@ cut . so it can cause a formal review of mouse &amp; eg . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces to the tool@@ ing and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart t@@ anning , but I didn &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to add any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them :
use the intelligent shifting not when you start to use it just as follows : perform a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the switch button pushed , while you move the mouse @-@ cursor to the other end of the text and place the mouse @-@ mouse again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes every sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when using smart moving the di@@ lap@@ times begins . later you can use the smart moving even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound@@ card and speaker , and that is correctly furnished .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; pressing the mouse button soon as the mouse @-@ cursor . this program was designed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which is preparing the to@@ iling of the Mau@@ le &apos;s pain .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that it is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse @-@ mouse will start . in this way , the dra@@ gging and desc@@ ended with the mouse can be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the word@@ search users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can lay down users to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which should be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) give you the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup .
on the second page you can select the default text password . from the text pass@@ codes you can often select text passages , without typ@@ ing them . the passages can of course be processed .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you define the dictionary for the Wor@@ m@@ ite . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can use the vocabulary with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are recorded in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes a input field for the key@@ note of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a run @-@ storage of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; properly aimed , you can enter the sentences in the input field you want to hear . each pronounced set is app@@ ended at the run memory . you can select from it , which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two mapping cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ m@@ ite , as well as the page of K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the cart card , you provide the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the drawing code , with the text on the language generator will be handed down .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; you know two kinds , pass the text . select the activation field if the text is left unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the cros@@ sover field is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command on the voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation with your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using as a language service as a language service is &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to provide the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the counter @-@ language service is available and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if the TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text color in the menu text password or in the list for text pass@@ codes .
with the selection of instant you speak the chosen text box directly and additionally inserted in the cache storage . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text box is first entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box , you can specify whether the text log @-@ book will be stored automatically when the editing process can be saved .
with the selection of text pass@@ codes , the book is stored . if you choose modifications , the text password will not be stored . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the password @-@ password is to be stored .
the page of Wor@@ m@@ ite contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ms . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field indicates if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the dictionary currently used dictionary .
with the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the language in the selection field .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by paragrap@@ hs of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the list of words using a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summar@@ ised , and how these things are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly created words automatically inser@@ ts into the dictionary , create a dictionary over time with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to the processing of text pass@@ agen@@ text@@ books is tw@@ o@@ divided . in the upper part the text@@ books are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text box , you can change the text box or the corresponding key@@ note . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or select selected text passages and books you can either reach over the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the order of text pass@@ codes or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the registry .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the registry .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the contract .
if this menu is en@@ li@@ fied , a post@@ pon@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default through the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left @-@ left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu is en@@ li@@ fied , a narrow gro@@ in in the lower part of the main square with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is indicated , a post@@ pon@@ able le@@ list is displayed for text pass@@ agen@@ text@@ books with entries . the bar is arranged by default on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the left @-@ left side and toes the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
most likely , you have not entered the command for the voice output or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth . set ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the mapping tab . ( see entry dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a voice output system of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . the license allows us to use the festival free of charge and re@@ distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java @-@ language generator . currently he only supports English pron@@ unciation . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and re@@ distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setting of the voice output , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the VO is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ ate@@ i so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA for free of non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be sent to as default input .
the voice output D@@ äm@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides for all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generators is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ voice services , which is installed in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends in detail from your computer and its configuration .

filters available for drawing chain composition provide a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wron@@ gly stressed or faul@@ tless messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included , is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news , the k@@ mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be accepted as a prerequisite . read about it too .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text will be processed , before he is sent to the programme speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unciation to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations to select a matching language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispute &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; sets four types of texts .
the output of screen readers have the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps this orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warning have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg . processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these assignments will be resum@@ ed after the release of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you are looking for a long text on a website , you can welcome someone with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who is entering the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; -@@ aler@@ ts are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text calls . each order that you encounter from the check @-@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text presentations . text calls are intended for issuing longer texts that have no special urgency .
all four orders are lab@@ eled in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . when an application reads the output of a screen record , during &amp; kt@@ a ; just such reading , this edition is stopped and ended .
first , you must know that filters never apply to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text presentations , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news applied .
filter the text and enter it on the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can still be more types of filters .
strings replace pieces of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined fil@@ en@@ closures as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding possible .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translation by &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker op@@ tionally you can send orders depending on the content of the text or subject to the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set up a female voice for example , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter determines that his rules don &apos;t apply , he gives the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; b ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filter that were created on the page below . the processing by the filter is carried out in order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the standard filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are worked in the series following from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be displayed further below .
for the installation of strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . will these patterns be found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement parts . big and small , when compared is not observed .
enter your filter for a name . you can choose this name as you wish , he just have to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces him in accordance with the string . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to move the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the available list .
if a language is listed here , the filter is only applied if the present@@ er speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when pressing the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button de@@ pressed .
here is a value registered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application ID supports you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ation@@ ID @-@ ID Cop@@ y @-@ 34@@ 32 has to be displayed , you can only enter copies .
the string code filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ va Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the strings filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by parti@@ tions ( space characters ) .
in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular , click on the k@@ deu@@ ction .

X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ forming . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the ambient variable AT@@ H , it is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker box , you can send texts to a particular spokes@@ man who is set up on the Car@@ tei@@ card speaker , or to a spokes@@ person with certain properties . you can for example set that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text transferred to the filter is looking for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is issued on the basis of the speaker characteristics that the program proposes ; and the characteristics of the speakers are selected at the car@@ ded map speaker . with the speaker @-@ selected filter you can write the chosen speaker .
if the filter is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular prin@@ t@@ out . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; - editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular , you can call it with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired copies . if the text fulfil@@ s the specified filter conditions , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements best . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ aders or to delete all settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ va Filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entry . you must apply at least one condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer to lend their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands give you

none of the named language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Dis@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able is working properly . that &apos;s why you don &apos;t have to use this voice to read the web site . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so whole sentences is ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string implementation device . see .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you will find in the documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own your own license .
if you have access to the KDE Co@@ de@@ archive , you can download the package consisting of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find out of it in the folder . furthermore , you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ code under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS also works with each language syn@@ thesizer , who can be started at the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; can be started .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . so draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages rate . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; for information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend it for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to compile a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages and developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you download the source tex@@ te of &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the source tex@@ tar@@ chi@@ v for col@@ de@@ code or have downloaded the program posted each night , then install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if speech @-@ dispute with your language syn@@ thesizer works properly . to do this , you can use the shell script by the SPD .
&amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program of speech Disp@@ at@@ cher uses . the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed that the installation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can re@@ tire pro@@ posi@@ - or de@@ fle@@ eting , repeat the output or break down .
when an application text is available , it can provide an application for example a female English speaker . if you have set up a spokes@@ man whose language is English and whose sex is female , this is , otherwise automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ a ; choose a speaker , see you in .
when you click to add a speaker to the list , then clicking on the list or click Edit , the mapping card speaker is shown . as an example , the modules of the module for Festival Interactive is displayed . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the coding for text that is handed to the festival . in votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sliding racks , you can select volume , intercom speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display these grey , the voice you selected will not be able to select these settings .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded multiple seconds due to their size . if you mark this set @-@ up , these voices are already being syn@@ thes@@ ized with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( in greater storage capacity ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this activation field can not be selected , you have not yet created a spokes@@ man ( or do not forget to apply ) .
if this is marked with the launch of t@@ sm@@ s , the program window is visible when starting from kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this is marked and t@@ sm@@ s is not running yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this gives you the possibility to read or otherwise control .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the present@@ er id corresponds to the column ID on the map controller speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can use sat@@ a double in the order that is selected in the list below , pre - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also displayed on the other post@@ cards ) and t@@ sm@@ s will be reduced to the symbol in the system stage . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here only text presentations are performed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts can be found in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was &amp; kt@@ b ; either compiled with support for the appropriate audio module or t@@ ect@@ are ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the intercom velocity here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds about the half and 200@@ 00 ; % about double normal intercom velocity . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system to take over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of all@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers have the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps this orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warning have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg . processor becomes too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that addresses news . if you &amp; eg have just read a long text on a website , you can welcome &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone greet someone who just enter the room .
if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output into the queue .
this audio file will always be re@@ played if a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this tab are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and spending of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read the No@@ tification messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s and click noti@@ fications . the check card notification appears .
highlight this activation field to put the pre@@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disadvantage . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are down@@ lighted and t@@ ect@@ are ; reads no noti@@ fications .
if this attitude marks , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is un@@ played , of &amp; ect@@ are ; not pre@@ read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads news before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentions your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following Plac@@ eholders :
here you can enter the properties of the desired radi@@ ator . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker at the top of the list . see this also .
note that there are three levels of events . for a specific event a specific application is specified , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . as the last option there is an action to carry out the one under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications how that follows :
use the button to save the settings for the aler@@ ts in a file . invited the button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will begin with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click deleted . all entries are removed from all types .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains marks for the control of voices , the intercom velocity , volume , the voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice that the festival is using SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio position in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog is not based on 100@@ ml ; % is set , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA = / / W@@ 3@@ C / / EN &quot; htt@@ p = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked my B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filter and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds begin to read text into individual phrases . this can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized with the first sentence , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump or stop and break down , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this directly .
here you can see the sub@@ lim@@ it@@ ator filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a proposition of a pro@@ lim@@ ation@@ ist filter . you can change its settings or add additional typ@@ ing filters , but there will be no beg@@ inner .
the easiest option to check out the speaker selection through selection . turn the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start read faster with the pre @-@ read , as only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text orders at the Car@@ path@@ tab , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal satellite det@@ ector is automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ spec@@ ting filter compare text with a regular expression of typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal codes 8 ) at the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal codes are removed from the text automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default typ@@ ing filter is included .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed from using the normal satellite det@@ ective filter , you can insert it again by loading the file named _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the map selection speaker , you can write the speaker @-@ settings for the application . the check card is displayed when
use of the default speakers ( the top one on the carto@@ onist speaker ) . in other words , there are no speaker properties fixed .
use of the most suitable intercom device , who does not delete or edit any properties of a single speaker . if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; accept this speaker . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ p ; the speaker , which corresponds most to the original characteristics .
you can select the method for entering the desired configuration properties by clicking on one of the choice of choice .
select the properties of the required spokes@@ man here . if this feature does not matter , you give nothing .
highlight this indication , if the property is to take prec@@ e@@ dence over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
as the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language , is before you know that a certain application is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to re@@ use all properties in the field spokes@@ man , which is most likely to delete the following , click the Sel@@ ective button , and then apply to speaker , which corresponds most to the speaker .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
t@@ sm@@ s cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have de@@ filed Deb@@ u@@ g support but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and t@@ ect@@ ant ; it is probably finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stret@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by this , perhaps a compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer are installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stret@@ amer .
the audio output about Al@@ sa is not working when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . at the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that states : intelligence to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at al@@ sa which prevent an equ@@ ilater@@ al opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but t@@ sm@@ s does not show this voice .
add your new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Record / record the new voice . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL so you have found the voice to the developer .
at the map audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program has to be installed and via the ambient variable AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ om@@ mod@@ s like festival Interactive also provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this function is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML in SS@@ ML is converted . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ former@@ filter , and set the intercom speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to pre @-@ read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able Gender doesn &apos;t seem to work . so the festival does not make any mistakes , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber &apos;s gender tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added one own string qu@@ itting filter filters and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ on ; no longer full @-@ to @-@ pass or go back . on the car@@ ding @-@ screen contracts is displayed , the order occurs only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , question mark , excav@@ ation , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be fil@@ tered . use the filter for these signs instead a filter for the typ@@ ing .
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound architecture ) . Al@@ sa is based on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stret@@ ch in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the modules for G@@ stre@@ amer are registered by using G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with al@@ sa conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text read , too , if you start a text contract and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ure , the current sentence will still be read yet .
the audio @-@ program so@@ x is used for general setting of the intercom speed is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can so@@ x install with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
if you have downloaded the tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ et archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a fitting folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ en ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably at least is removed , or at least only on request created .
the following modules for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a run @-@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of Debian distribution ) . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure option shows the configure parameters that causes the skip of generating .
as default , this folder is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the variable variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you have to specify as --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example

before you go and use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is disclosed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can set volume , intercom speed and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ts ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help you find the instructions posted with the festival . would you like to pre @-@ read websites , you must install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice continues at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / 2003 / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you must enter for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first looking for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use Russian voice , the code must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ on like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are used . then the Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio edition . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
please note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German lyrics Di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
with this method additional Wr@@ apper Code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes to voice syn@@ theses . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users managing the TCP / IP network preferences in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; display . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the adjustment of network properties allows .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices are later added , the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the files , according to the core version ,
the module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the appropriate selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release value is best meets . by selecting the setting non @-@ once @-@ inqu@@ ishment , the definition cannot be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . before , all options are gray , meaning that settings can only be viewed . in the system administration mode , you will arrive by clicking the button @-@ saving mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed are set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click &quot; button &quot; button ... &quot; set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to view the dialogue with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be required for the system at the same time . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required for each system start . in the selection list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration must be specified . in the input field IP @-@ address must be specified by the required TCP / IP address . in the network mask , the sub@@ net@@ mask is to be defined .
if this setting marks , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values assigned in this dialog are displayed as a device &apos;s properties in the Device list .
it should be ensured that IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switching on a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch off a activated network device is de@@ activated by selecting from the list and click interface ....
sets the IP address of the machine in the local sub @-@ network that conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is available on the computer more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected , in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name . this is necessary because computers only request IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer to the attri@@ but@@ able part of the rider &apos;s attri@@ tion trig@@ gers a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , or altered valu@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a single and execution or demo@@ tion in the list with buttons or her@@ ding in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; out of the group calcul@@ ator can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Nam@@ eser@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then add the button to add . the entry will be added in the list .
from the group machine to the nam@@ esp@@ ace please select an entry and then click on the editing button . the dialog is displayed .
the list specifically known computers describes machine name to @-@ IP address links for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with the boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
usually contains the list specifically known computers some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses assist . this still in the test @-@ related version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP @-@ address of the known computers and click Add ... The dialogue of New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
click on the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several Ali@@ as names , de &apos;s button several times press and the other Ali@@ as names enter .
select an entry of a specific machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to process your computer is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , it extends if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as k@@ package or installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other libraries are required .
this will only be recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configurations files are discussed .
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is reflected in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP @-@ address of a network interface is available . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact point available to a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP is not easy to use . in any case , the IP address may not be easily chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the m@@ mas@@ ke is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub @-@ network .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg . .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for IP rep@@ airing .
the AC address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content can be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for band drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the second goal was the answer to a question that gave my wife : how much longer it takes to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be taken by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; cul@@ t the band back and read the pre @-@ voltage information of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview on the tape not , you will be asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , is looking for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ man shall be re@@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt drive changes , to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched out by out of the entry for the band .
before the throwing of the bank , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns with a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band @-@ types need to be format@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure needs to be done before you are format@@ ted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted this procedure usually form a format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives , however , not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the belt . all the data on the belt are lost thereby ! after completing the format@@ ting , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files rus@@ hed . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only saved for this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and pick you up in ...
once the backup was initiated , dialogue is open to secure . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialogue will be secure . dialogue shows the progress of the securing , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked for selected file or folders .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test process has been started , dialogue settings will be checked for checking . in this dialogue , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will be examined . this dialogue shows the progress of the inspection process and data offset and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can re @-@ establish the Rest@@ ore , the files that are to be restored , this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives files , which belong to the entry for the band@@ age . it will be restored only to the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . all the marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Connec@@ ting menu .
once the Rest@@ oration process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue , you can once again check your selection and change the filing folder for restoration .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , dialogue will be re@@ making . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data offset and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ construct the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ content . this operation del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ create the index on two types of the band :
by this , a backup profile is created with the straight selected files and the default settings . you can make for a backup profile the following settings :
the current working folder in which the backup should be taken place . the list of prescribed files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work@@ folder .
for all files listed under backup files , applies that only the files currently being stored on the same fil@@ esystem , as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ esystem , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independent of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to as@@ certain which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only those files are saved , which have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the final incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the sn@@ ap@@ shots before the call of tar . this causes all files backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons are files and lt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ movable version of the belt .
if this attitude is active , transm@@ itter &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be loaded to the drive . at some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing procedures can be performed .
if the option is turned on , it is trying to block &amp; k@@ dat ; it is not working with all band@@ ages . maybe this setting does not work with all band@@ ages .
if the option is enabled , when incorpor@@ ating the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; it automatically shu@@ ts the tape . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ liner .
is the option turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ ships support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band &apos;s drive will communicate .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the start of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this character is machine name : seconds , whereas the name of the complete name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time has passed since the band is format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the viewer is suitable for in@@ experienced users , who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system offers the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; experienced users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions with whose help the protocol files of certain programs are fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 will have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available with whose help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first of all , the main protocol @-@ file of the system - it will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of its a small news window , so you will not have access to system managers . the protocol files normally find themselves in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually not permission to read .
you can also use the filtering bar in order to filter a string into the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection range will be displayed next to the filter . then a log box contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search function is contained .
you can of course select another entry at this point . select the string of the filter search record , and then insert in the filtering bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; all protocol lines on which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are shown with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to show only a specific process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the issue of a certain command such as the Start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filtering bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to pop up new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ he@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in seper@@ ate sub @-@ chamber . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage an additional window . once you have selected a window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort will find more information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;

welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for the control of the program starts at the high @-@ speed control system in the &amp; Linux ; it is because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further in historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about myself : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ der file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start running the system or when changing to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ ters , which will only once start . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually a lot of use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ so in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default @-@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the previous version 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and edit the 3 . be very careful if you &apos;re going through the in@@ it@@ tab changes . if you have noticed anything then you will rep@@ airing the system and run the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you type -@@ l type in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts in hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will stop with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg . a server running level , that only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ level which will &amp; eg . , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : pull one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you prefer to drag them into a new running area . to just copy them from the Edit menu or from the context menu , and even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target area of action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you again try to add the system service .
note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous page .
to move an entry into another running level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ time with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an item manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by er@@ eg@@ utes the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ miss the changes .
because of the risk of loss of loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continually new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ IL@@ O Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to execute under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for the proprietary features of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without notice when their configuration files are not present or incorrect .
the significance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made modifications , you need to store them . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or to save the entry in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two mapping cards , user and user list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some mapping cards are only shown when you have advanced system settings . only if you have extended space settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will be activated on@@ . further mapping cards will appear , if shadow passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the map of Pass@@ word shall appear , if shadow @-@ passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this menu map appears only if available for at least a single fil@@ tered fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizing ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can use parameters for each user , whereby the limited restrictions are available in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with plac@@ e@@ ability .
the vac@@ ation@@ card groups informs about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , find in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by displaying them in the large box .
the dialog &apos;s dialog includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu or group or click on the right button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or dele@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group is similar .
with this module you can install the L@@ IL@@ O boot manager to remove the boot password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change OS@@ es , change , change and more .
