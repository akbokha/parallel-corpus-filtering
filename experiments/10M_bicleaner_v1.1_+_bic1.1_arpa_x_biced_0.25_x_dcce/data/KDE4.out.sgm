<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is located on the site of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the babelfish-page itself, where you can insert the texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & Conqueror; despite their small size, they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & conqueror; by doing this more easily accessible.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & Cqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & Conqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Conqueror; select Settings Add-extensions.... open the selection tab tools and choose the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default modules from the package kde; add-ons. please note that any more modules on your system are installed if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, the & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Conqueror; then click on extras. then you can view the page, the & Conqueror; to the crash, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Analytics module (also called folder filter) can be found in the & Conqueror; menu bar under extras filter. with the module you can filter & conqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To display the DOM construction in the & Conqueror; use extras DOM tree to display... and therefore open a new window with the DOM of the document. as default, the display begins with the root nodes of the document, example: the element, all other knots are subelements of this throw-drawing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; represents a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbolic and text views to make the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; it consists to graphiate folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a file or folder, reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily be recognized, if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the UNIX operating system.</seg>
<seg id="16">At & FSView; is an entry in the Treatype presentation, a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the right corner contains meaningful color-related and signage settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on view color mode, can be either depth for the light detection of the screw-tone, or figure of a different file, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different qualities of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify, if enough space is available for representation, or if the area of subordinate rectangular configurations is to be used (whereby thus, display error by restrictions on the sign of the Treat occur). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When designing algorithms for treemaps should generally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item. during the Treatine & FSView, this goal is not always observed. there will be a frame that is no longer available for inserting entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like distribution of an area of an agreement for subordinate entries, the implementation remains left to the end. here it is designed for the marking and avoiding the space loss due to getting beneficial the surfaces that are as square. the best methods on this matter are lines, columns, or recursive second-line.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal presented surface for an entry on the menu entry in the area. instead a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the superordinate item, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, which was developed for applying KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also check out the publication; go to news about shared versions and other information about & digicame; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get in & digicame; to participate in is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for announcing in the developer mailing list of & publication;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you come and start; for the first time, you are asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. here you can select a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the folder folder folder, to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine. here, data records will be stored. this path will remain the same for all subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digicame; you will additionally use as Albenbibliothek. setting digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, which contains images, as base folder. no picture is changed. during the breakup of the folder you'll get a progression like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Ds returned to curvy the library path across its complete depth. you can choose no subfolders, unless it came up in petalled folder. you can insert them in a petalled folder. you can insert it in a hidden folder. you can insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as the base folder, you will notice that the albums are not allowed to use photos as symbols. you can change that by clicking any photo from the album and take it on the folder symbol. this will then be used as an album symbol. further details can be found in the albums.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transfer to the machine, the camera appears as USB mass storage device. the connection may also be implemented via the picture transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& nbsp; uses the program gPhoto 2 to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transferring images of digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are big files and transfers to the serial port, this connection has become obsolete. it supports these cameras and guides the transmission of the pictures with gPhoto 2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgore 2 must have been created with libexif support, so that the thumbnail will be read from some libgative 2 camerers. if the EXIF-support is not available in libgative 2, you might notice thumbnail or the generation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to go on, is how easy to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI-modules: the KDE Image plugin Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for & digitization;, KPhotoalbum, Showers and Gwenview develop. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics apps. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as there is also a user. your advantage is that it is much easier, and digitization; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in and checking out; even perform.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no inventory no longer a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will not use & digitization;. the approach to store metadata both in a database as well as in image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you need to maintain anything inside your system. you need to decide whether other access to your photos do not want to store them on a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc; notice that you will have to switch back to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your memory location. if you were able to organize some photos, then you will use sub-folders like & eg, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01, 2008-01.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as sioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant intake of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files, and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacket easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the Metadata option to activate in the site page of metadata in & Check. this ensures that exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what to change? to do this, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you now need to assign any photo words, lettering and assessment. of course, you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start doing the best with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keyword, keyword, as you are often called hot, or categories on other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import alogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then it is no problem and can simply insert the pictures in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by using a subtree on another. the modified keywords will be followed by & Lock; updated while the subtrees were persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata altering it. this is a very gross representation, since each block of metadata is made in truth from many sections. data stream and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">The keywords - the next section refers to lettering or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want most anyone to just see your photos only, you want them to share with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence. the lettering has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motif you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if an image is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & checking, you can export as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caprification. you can even export it for a selection of pictures, then these signposts are exported to your wishes into the lettering and / or the title of the Web-gallery system. therefore, you need to tell the story for the duplication no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train decks the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of geolocation are already innumerable and will be deeper into the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future you can open your journeys through images with geographical references. however, this can also export the photos at the entrance site. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googlemaps.</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "Copyleft is a vocabulary with copyright and refers to the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all the changed versions, so also for the work of others." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & publication; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to protect the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization. after which this value was saved, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support Commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Authoritative title (synonym for publisher): linked to the author. examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this field must be filled in well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider in order to identify who the photo offers. if the photographer does not necessarily work the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reuters, or Associated Press. if the picture is a warehouse, then the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not provide protection against abuse. each of which has a little more than basic metadata, delete or change. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is essential for the majority of your photos only of low interest. for professionals and holding professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermarks is unique per image. and digitization; will provide such a module for stacket processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnaround, plate cut, power supplies, ages, ages of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterprevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that you can happen in traditional paper images or negatives. this section is about problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data creation company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To tackle the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more difficult and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archivquality. of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it lies in your surveying room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD shooting devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it's about the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to error, even if you were just written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, cratzer, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there are a more favorable program called IsoBuster which seems to have works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disk, harddisks, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to gain the FormatchWar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly hexagal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn out the media with a good reception on high quality media in a non-propriated format. also, you can copy the media using a description, date & author Kenny and then stored on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers reserve your stats for themselves. their manufacturer's products include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disfault study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short, Disks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error message, SMART cannot notice this error. some of the SMART errors will notice the immediate forthcoming case. these are particularly readers and publishing orders. expected life-time amounts to between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss of power due to overvoltage. of course, you may also have data loss due to an electric blackout before you have saved the files, but these losses usually can be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices does not account much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processor. these can cause serious damage. at your computer, these anomalies can cause hardware, hardware replacement, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself from the inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed by a part of the energy storage. it is usually available in the form of a Steckerbar. remember, however, that not any peckerbar contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be careful that it provides protection against lightening and thus protects the properly attached devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can use to your machine, you should be sure that also all perperipherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also contain a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable-dems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even an accident of few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a subbrittle free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overvoltage tests, these devices can automatically provide cordless power if a power outage occurs. if you buy a USV, then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern yourself the potential risk that your machine system is exposed and compare its security in electricity disorders with the costs of avoiding this. a high quality maintenance protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider getting all the cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. you can use this as a drive under & Linux; Windows, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the HDDs but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general secure solution. for this it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com make online storage services available on photos. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more unlimited memory, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed store. thus they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs make at least the data integrability between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred. all of these disorders remain undetected until you have no protection to it. nobody seems to have thought of it in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interference within the data currents. in normal filesystems these errors will remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle records on lower level and can be scalable. it's open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is available for & Linux; but it is not a part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in job systems. at notebooks, the percentage of the theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the methists think. it leads to a lower damage than theft or new installations; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: incorrect, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, routing, JFS and XFS to name the widened filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are located 1-2 Blending settings from fundamental physical borders. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 Megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compactcameras and the end result are the optimum for compactcameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk is available today for 100 & euro; thus, do not make anyone else for data loss. thus, you can make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make something more dangerous than the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates, or the size of hard disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on a remote flash drive. if, then one day, a flash strike, you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. do not forget airplane-cheeke: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, Desasterprevention does not mean a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as it is said above is one more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files backed up to be backed up. it is a snapshot of no history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential assurance: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of up to two periods: that of the complete backup and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates several moments. you can restore the original status at any time with such a backup. this backup comes with a locking system the next one with the exception that it is only discontinued and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer-scripts copied rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to rediscover losses and restore it. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of working files. in the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of each month. each more dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in image file stored IPTC information, association XMP files, original reserve, storage, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future due to your nature is unforeseeable. unfortunately, there is no other possibility than having a certain guard. unfortunately, there is no other possibility than having a certain guard. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the statements made in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for anyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and safety technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. this is actually always growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's take a look that you have entered the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & water; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of iron if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software you can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was created as an open source standard developed by the GIF. it can save a lot more. it's loss free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF required and a slow commited application. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, with some cameras you can store your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adjusted by many people. there are therefore over 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open pipe format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it even sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001 to replace Adobe its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; - a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a combination of XML and RDF. file information will be included with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archives a original of your recording, mostly in the rough format. XMP fits, since the metadata changes separately from the image file. therefore, you should think if you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which includes a large area of operational purposes and business models. in the DCMI communities and DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to reach a broader acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures on the camera eedium are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a refining processing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & checking, edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were under certain circumstances cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleria, covert in MPEG, use in contact leaves, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & checking. in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description, as you have photos that you already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking, connect them with the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. some cameras will appear for a while. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file size is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar, from the main window of & publication; or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from her camera into a single album in & publication; at downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend that the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired options using the default options of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download it. the button selected will be checked until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera is supported, an option new download is available. these pictures were not downloaded from & Lock. in this case, the new pictures have been marked with a star in advance showcase. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons All download or choose selected, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, displayed in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums will be displayed, like normal folder, displayed in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and then press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digicame; loads the pictures from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the button Delete. if you only want to delete some, then you must select it first and use the delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility of taking photos that you deleted from the camera. so they should be checked carefully if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera, you should do this via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often not used as a filename for the photographs. the filenames are usually reactivated once you load photos of different fables in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for datas-based underscore. if you use this latter option, a folder per day is automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options after transfer opens three more options, which are carried out before the pictures are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data on the author in the standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another medium format than standard format, you can for example use the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% M:% M. place the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strangletime.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use the camera file name, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase letters. or if you prefer this option if you prefer that.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & publication; used for a photo, is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording, not all cameras set this information. in the sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic spin turn is switched on, and when your camera doesn't supply this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic spin turn, use the button Advanced and select the auto spin turn right in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera comes information about the date on which the photo has been made available, can & digicame; this sub-row is based on the picture data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same sub-album. not all cameras are available. in the page sidebar Meta data you can check out what information your camera could have embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off-off, and in this case stores & digicame; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option. use the button Advanced and choose the option-based sault at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from your computer on their camera is the button download. select then upload, where you can select the files uploaded and select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods choose.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the selection is done, ask & digicame; you where the images are to load up high. a folder-selection dialog appears for the camera. pick the folder you want here and press OK to load the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that is indicated in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to carve an area by automatic absorption of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can easily access a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & booking; users want to send the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it's good to get the position of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card references.The question is actually more, as the data in these fields come. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and images using the KIPI module to the geographical mapping (manual) and finally about manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a map or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can take place with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save these data in gpx format because this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which extract data from images and from GPS extract, and correlate with it. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the Coastute Coordinates, which are created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not display European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in french, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardity and copyright data. these data are automatically selected to the appropriate IPTC data fields, when the option when downloading the camera collection. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authorship is a synonym for fibers. this field should contain the professional photographer of the photographer. this can be designations, such as employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent, non-commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the photograph the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, as this is the image other & quot; anbietenquot;. if the image is a warehouse, then the group or agency the image will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the appropriate IPTC Fellow. thus the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of digicode; they are also available in other programs and can be imported into & Lock; they will be imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeling as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG images store: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, including those embedded in the pictures. therefore, your lettering can also be read from other images. caution: in pictures, which have already been signposted, will be overwritten by the analysis.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset once again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">If you come to the default values, these settings can be set on this page. however, if you are enabled to open the illuminator. some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better visualization results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the picture editing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch the toolbar if you use the picture editing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over-and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are set here. in picture editing, this view-mode can be inserted with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">By setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, because PNG used a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick machine, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files you can compress the deflate compression of TIFF images for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the deflate algorithm loss works free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of loss free JPEG-2000 files you can store loseness free. even if you were written off loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata still did not support, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & publication; the picture editing was only an image selection for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default size is that all green pixel are equal to ultra-violet light. if you use this option, this difference creates a little soft, eliminates this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the picture a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 gene patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white is used immediately by the camera. otherwise, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white-off is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting will only support for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors is the effect that underexposed images in four steps to get more details in the cutting edge. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-pointed, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the incapacity of your camera to view the nickname and adjust them. finally, you can try to reconstruct some unusual results, since they can reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally not be as fast as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green- and red portions from the yet saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminous value according to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & publication; to keep the time for the demolition process, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A deosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image of the particle data, which have many cameras and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; and Dcraw put you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. however, it creates farms in the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-softening of your lentils you can put the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color tax correct as you will be carried out during the trial.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color formations and gives instructions on how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & stock; information like the Farbinders from a Farms to translate into the other are the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, when a picture is opened in image editing, start / colour administration module with rough files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Attitudes of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed after opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Color Manager view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures in colour not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera producer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which does not contain color mapping or gambllasty. currently, crab gamma isn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof Profile, which you may emulate, as your image has been given by one device. this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller colour range as your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. you could manually correct it instead of leaving the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that the color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles will fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the target recognizable: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface which is supported by a number of & kde; images and image editing; many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition find some also in the context menu of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-command for tasks that are implemented by modules can be set in the menu under settings short-command.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI-modules you can get on the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slides should be easy to understand. the top recirregulator limit the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other crossroads turn off the metadata and / or which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left a list of all cameras installed on the left. on the right, there is a button venatic detection which is connected to the computer. however, if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image-line mode. currently, there are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you select a USBor FireWire mass storage camera from the camoute. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / re, specify on which you are hanging your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicame; use the camera to connect to your computer, bring them into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & checking out; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camamoell and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera appears in the Camera Camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera in the menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of polating dialog for moving out &gt; images in the dustbin, you can adjust the talk of & Lock; when you delete a photo in one album. in the sections deleting a photos and deleting a recording you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly and digitised, if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any feedbacks. otherwise, you need to apply changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">They can also include the display of the welcome screen at the start; at the start-up, this accelerates the start-up process from & checking;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting applause to look for new photos and checking out the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & Lock; if something was deleted from the basic folder, ask & digicame; you if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different shades can be added in & checking, to adjust the main window to your tastes. these settings allow you to select the settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is displayed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & checking, please find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& nbsp; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and improve and improve. image processing can be started by clicking on the thumbnails of an image or by the right-click menu of the preview or editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture editing contains a range of tools to enhance your images. so some of them are available as modules in & checking; therefore, they may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you can find in the picture editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current dates, enlarging factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper edge and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the picture editing your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you saved the file saving or the button saving out of the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it as you want.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the menu file and use the button Restore Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have made in the photo since last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undone by selecting editing-time or restored by selecting editing to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make yourself the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z as a backbone and make Ctrl; -switch-Z to remanufacture.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can press a moment longer in the toolbar, you will get a right-click menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation device in the toolbar, image high, image down or use the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can take in the photo and run zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the bar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">Viewing full-screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. you come into the normal view, where you don't want to use the Esc button. usually, you can view this in the dialog dialog by & Lock; change this way you can view the image window. see the section in setting up the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image file image and get the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print out single images or whole phrases. all picture-pages may be printed out of your choice. you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Expore printing assistant. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & publication; the main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation device. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view you can enter the marking with unlimited size or insert. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed. the marking are copied into the EXIFT and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be edited after 2000 characters and are reversed. if you want to use the IPTC address in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the signposts are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the apply button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review evaluation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in seeking and sorting them. it can be applied with either single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut string. the evaluation from the sidebar is always applied only to one image. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The review is written into the IPTC field. coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords display a search box to the filter of the keywords, the keywords, and a combo box with the previous in this & publication; -session passed.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be dynamically adjusted to the search term. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief in the input of keywords at a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by flagging the corresponding crosses areas in the tree. all tags of an image are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword "section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window. usually, the left sidebar with their album, - Datum-, sampling and viewpoints use. if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the cutting of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard tags. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view, to pull you with keyword. if the keywords existed, you can easily pull it out of the right sidebar and place on the selection. then a dialog appears if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example, the main window displays the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is reduced to a keywords which is reduced the amount to three pictures. they were pulled by Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree on the selection and discarded there. a dialog asks if this keywords should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched between settings and Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the crossroads at the end of the rule and then use the button. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason you use a colourless workflow is the colors that can actually take photographs from your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or in the web publish them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes on colour administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is available to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration. additionally, you will provide links with more detailed information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your educational flow met all the criteria specified below, then you don't have to worry about the colour administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB machine. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are by e-mail or the Web where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life for everyone is so easy, why should one then use another color space and thus have to worry about color manager?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hu@-@ ferring region, and the colours in the sRGB Farming, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger bullets, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente site and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kalliate my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB Farms?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you work in sRGB Farms or not, you need to kalliate your monitor, since the RGB of your monitor joins the circle. if you are working as in the Farms of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize the same, automatic barrier and contrast extend from the menu Korrigidly Automatic correction are automatically trying to make the best out of the menu. you will have to experiment with these effects in order to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize this method scalding the luminance values about the overall picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing color grading. this function is often a magnet correction for images that are dark or washed off.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method jushed the lightening factor of the colours of the selected image, so the histogram of the intention is the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same very good results achieved with improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic reckage: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright frontier tones and jushes the red, green- and blue channels on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast, this method enhances the contrast and volume of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed out images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly limited because over a color-channel is done with 8-bit per colour. in case you can go too far from the original picture. if you are able to perform the white equal in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode is working, your ways of correcting better will fall better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a whitish pattern of righted by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it through the menu-fit colors white-off the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The entrance window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original video straight again, it goes to the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red marker. the Luminumance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram is shown that dynamically has changed once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in good lighted pictures, most pixels have very small leguitars. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminaire.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, satiation and gamma. the shade adjusting you to improve the shadow details of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature Pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the pictures to use the colour temperature of the white-match. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white immediately with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The excess of the pixel indicator increases colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white immediately display. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and charging exactly this. each setting of the whipped of white you can put it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button-settings returns all the filter values again to its standard values and the corresponding neutral whiteboard. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code of code per color channel of the converted image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding requires also more disk space, calculating time and is also available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials. it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles. a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be carried out. a detailed guide to the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tworthiness. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error, so you can always use the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & publication; tool pigment effects puts you four pigment effects, a solar effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solararization, also called Sabatier, an effect of the image caused by a brief lightning light and subsequently replaced the development of the picture. the result was a partial negativity of the picture. the result was a partial negativity of the picture. this tool permits you to make this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible. a further increase finally generates a negativity that is not producing as photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the process works (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that makes it a stronger contradiction-effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimized reverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography. Velvias greatly saturated color, but also some of the photographers, especially those that are hardly landscapes dissatisfied, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. with great pictures the filter can select the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the color contraast and the luminosity of the photos. all your alignment can be viewed with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool is a good choice to increase the saturation instead of increasing them. all changes that you can perform in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool engraving and the simple light strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure. even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the Intention values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three sliding doors into it, and that can be moved to change the intention of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator and to pay attention to how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand the original and the preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is usually dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic patterns will be beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three rears: the top for the dark notes, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle notes, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color lacquer can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically limit the shade of the shade, middle and bright notes automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Outdoing: the exams allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the expatriots as in the input. for example, the compression of the outgoing can be used for example, to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the images are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and charging: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be stored and later loaded, the Gimp levels will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color chains, the input will be reusable automatically for all shadows, medium and solar discord. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the image of the original image to put the histuses of the histogram for red, green, blue, and leuminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overloaded indicator index controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display them the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjusting of the input used on red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the expatriots are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box, two symbols are to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera, most of the linear mode is the most sensual. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is helping.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a cranventeil to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright notes with dark outbed coincide and that the image pixel can be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">At the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the range you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is named after your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and charging: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colours buttons, automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, Middle and Sundays. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original picture to put the checkpoints for the red, green-, blue and legulecurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload indication is controlled all color channels to indicate overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminous canal. shadow and Sundays was applied with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & publication; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The canal-blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original item can be seen as a comparison of your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to switch these channels. in case you can also activate the appropriate paint components, as the channel mixer then DAS tools for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try the greener for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible smoke that comes from the bulking. Farms consists of small smokers that doesn't appear in the same place in the color canal and whose smoking pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you will reduce the Farms first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any blender settings can save you for later and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overloaded indicator index controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display them the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue Channel has been reactivated. the Luminumance option is enabled (1) and the original picture is under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white a working step, since color pictures can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good from all the scenarios and fits especially well with portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filmed: simulates a black / white film exposure with a staves of linsenfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orange filmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red linsenfilter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar time to day-time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellowing filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow ruler. this is the most natural shade-correct and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creating hot bright and medium tones while he adds a little cold in the shade of a pressure and re-development in an epiic. this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & publication; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color-painting or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the thrust of an old master, a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2) to see. the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & nbsp; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to insert the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streetting eye. under the picture the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you place the desired type of type for your picture. through a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and white images), abbreviated it with a cute three-dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a bone of garlic and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value area for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This combined target picture will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool by side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any location. this also works at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">Using this tool is very intuitive to user. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text output, orientation, color from the bulls and character set with its characteristics as you need. you will be the drawing character of the image size. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. already the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the picture was saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & publication; tool template apply, you can put a template on an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Pablone uses in image processing can be used to create checks on an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to take advantage of PNG files and should be included with maximum compressing (9) for the reduction of file size of the template, so send an e-mail in English to the & publication; mailinglist checking-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for a first time, you must put in dialog with the "base folder in dialog" button. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, appears a component view, which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder updates the prescheline of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifier factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button magnifies the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized: this button resized the underlying picture. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you must reduce the image according to the mouse button. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">OK, if you want to apply the template on your image. the image is then adjusted automatically to the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; three different tools are available for viewing. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates especially in dark areas, granny pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharp mask works at the contrast of edges to let an image sharper. in fact, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, since he really improved the sharpness. it is a little bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the sharpness. elements are smaller than the dissolution. the same phenomenon can be observed when color-points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more detrimental than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images, a camera is often applied for upswing. images in the raw-format is always to be cured in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner do a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by calling a photo with the edge-edge diver. you can also call the navigation protocol to the menu recording.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this, however, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also reinforcing the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image the tool refocus. you can get more information and a comparison of all techniques to do.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crackly. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than to raise it. use the tool to create a soft character with the menu entry. use the tool display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the thumbnails will help edit the image. the video window displays the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate often good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blurredness mask become too strong, smoke and get an impression of atrocities in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of a canal are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radios. they therefore should take pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is being added to the original. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference. one can thus define a minimum difference for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones of sharps and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces, directions and uranium surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp masking filters. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellate = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & nbsp; tool Refocused refocused on an image by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted-protected unfolding filter of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool looks a picture to & quot; refocused more than just trying to sharpenalize the photo. he uses a technique named FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique named FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus usually better results than unsharp. you can start it from the menu by calling colors reviewing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung is working much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel, which is far from the original pixel. however, the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value when your image is very blurred but should be careful on halo vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1%. if the noise filter is too low, & eg, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will even be lubricated.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. this parameter is most commonly caused by a sharpened filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unpaid zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Size: this value determines the size of the Transformationsmatrix. an increase in matrip size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's edge. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing as and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any any refocus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, colorations, and Intensive tifications on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than acutations. this could be caused by this, the unsharp masking also uses a larger neighborhood than acutations.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurredness. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made using an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficiently light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of raising corrections in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothness puts the blurredness of the area that was blacked to produce a natural sweetener.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tints allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want to take blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool missing error is one of the most developed tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to sort the filter flavor fainting you can use the rider glasses and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed reserve p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoother bet on the picture. weighed up against larger values chiefly homogeneous regions and detail. a value of 0.9 should be necessary. please note that the detailence always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly into all directions while a value close to 1 only in one direction. in case you have a high value of wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best positioned at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore put this value fitting to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specify how often the algorithm is going through. usually, there is 1 or 2 dates.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should also be small chosen. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride span [0,1, 10]: integrative step into pixel. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small. he doubles the term. we therefore recommend it to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and charging exactly this. every setting of educational errors can be saved in a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct imaging is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how imaging with little artefacts can be removed. the module is taken in a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see, there are a peculiar black artifact in the foreground, that through a bad movies during the trip, the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & checking came; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. by dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensation from the camera or fashion; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a baskets that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled by the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filters. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can accumulate the picture. the area shown by the radius is moving across the image and color in it becomes smoothes and thus minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value determines the pixelabovation to determine. if it is lifted up the pixelabovation to determine if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and smoke or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise will be removed or noise tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximise when you want to remove a shmite sound or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminants of the image. we recommend you to change colour or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the shade of the picture. we recommend you to change colour or luminance to improve one image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker ranges which are typically stronger than to increase. however, it swallows also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of Phasenjitteriness. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if he is increased, the edges can occur if it can occur to a minimum, smoking and phasenjitter appear at the edges. he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and charging: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how rough reducing your life can change. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied to default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too cracky for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately to draw much easier than an image. use the tool for softening with the menu entry. use the device window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & publication; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic production.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts about your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauze's sound noise, cinematography, compression arteartearte and local bugs which emerge in digital, original or detrimental digital images, thereby gaining the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm may be used for color and text installation. the textual composition is carried out with another tool, the image failed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannado and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as being a lossy compressionsalt, he creates some compression & quot; Artitequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this attitude finds these problems correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and charging exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work. but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can therefore disrupt the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with incomparable noise is reduced.. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grained on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo created with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanning lighting and photopapier. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & nbsp; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos showing with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are copyrighted by Martin dickhead.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly in high-quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras have JPEG compression about a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; name pixel quot; and" "" "bright Pixelquot; and" "" "bright Pixelquot;" "" "on a photo with a dark image method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to accommodate you the dark image right next to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defect.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark picture to the corrected picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard notes the last dark and that automatically invites you to the next meeting again.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture. the preview display shows the issue of the filter with the current settings. bad pixel are taken out in all disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the thumbnails and the results of the filter. select afterwards the best filter method to interpolate these pixelblocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: it becomes an average of the adjacent pixel. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from 1 of the pixelblock to be drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubo: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction to a color photo taken from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, which was applied to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & nbsp; VignettierungsSurgery is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. lower corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foresight lenses, especially the medium-sized and large photo format, can often be illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that the sensor can be achieved there. they may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has cons. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Blending filter, which it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. puzzling objects should also use with center filters to use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unmatched effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and colour scanner, digital cameras and movie scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating a equivalent transformation in a raw material that is applied without these filters. the tool Vignettierungscorrection is applied to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the VignettierungsSurgery and with three other insertion of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting subdues at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with a blending filter of 1, or randomly of a light intensity of 2, distortive .Increase the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting, reduce it by a small degree to compensate.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the vignettiation reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulators provide you with only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile to adjust the target image, let the value for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & publication; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettierungscorrection to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminance and contrasting correction was also done with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & publication; linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar coating effect, flawed but at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient Grades corrected the remote corners to which the second Grades. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values of pad distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the Grades. this value affects more at edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners are the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads a correction to the first Grades through. negative values increase while positive the image decreased.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value jusks brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion correct. the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or stamp-shaped correction should be done before all the cutting or size changes. best perform this correction than all the first by. if you cut a picture and carry out a tonal correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point. afterwards, you can fix the tonn- / hoist distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a pad that will correct the resulting image black corners. you can convert it using the cutting-tool in the menu transformers from image processing, or over the zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonal correction is taken. the next logical step for some motifs like e.g. recording from the front, frames and paintings, it's the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared movie of the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitive area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you can move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set graining and cinematic sensitivity (ISO). activate the option to simulate a highly sensitive movie. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film graining and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels mix to the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscaping photo of New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the painted image below (2). the sensation of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the shretern.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & publication; filter footage is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grazing on your images. this is known by classic high-speed film such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitiveness of the movies that manufacturers large silver grances of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-body effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight specially in your monochromen photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the standard value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film light effect on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that used the (2). the used film-sensitivity is equivalent to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & publication; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & nbsp; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five out. thicker brushes are better suited for big pictures. glassworks controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the softness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and that worked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothness 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & stock came; filter coal drawing used color and intention gradient to create a carbon fiber. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the cap selects the foundation size and the lower jusks the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the cohesion filters. the original image (1) and the altered picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved further through the adjustment of the Intensive value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & nbsp; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was ringed in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & nbsp; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarily landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it looks through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogue to the wave blocks 1 will distorts the picture here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate the calculation and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by blurredness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurred the image along sternfoerde lines which emanates from a central point. this simulates the blurred camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpness: blurred the image through rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurredness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: blurred the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurredness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness Unsharpness: blurred the image soft into the dark and strong in the light tones. this produces photos with an dreamy and shiny soft focus (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunsharp: blurred the picture by random shift of the pixels and simulates the blurredness of an arbitrary movable camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: find the color-colour in the image and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time for the calculation and cause a high CPU load. this calculation can therefore disrupt any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to take regentropes on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows it to change the size of the drip. as the drip size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish-eyes changes the optical effect of drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can maintain a range of shelves. use the tool-free from regentropes. use the tool-tool to select the area, for example a face that is to stay free. if you start after afterwards the filter stops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regentropes Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transformieren Drew, or Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">To reduce an image is simple. the big question is how to inflate an image and stop the details? how can you invent the missing information or guessed? the CImg algorithm that is used here, makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transits size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size uses a linear interpolation method to join the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; use a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the input of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and charging are used precisely for this. each entry for photo can be used as text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel calculation time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles, by adding a small colour picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common surgical procedure, but also a frequently underestimated tool to merge an image. in order to add a photo, you need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and move the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo look like after the cutting area. you can pull the size of the one to cutting area by moving at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button the cutting-button of the picture editing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file file saving or storing in the menu file to save the newly cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the side ratio that you have defined in dialogue will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool by side ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and the cross-format will always be assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool by side ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons are extant to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in dialog you can set up with the max. ratio of the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool by side ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation (horizontal directional or Vertical). when you use the cutting tool, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image measurements are reflected in the EXIF tables, allowing the EXIF data to reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination assistance help enable help to put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic ponds are based on the principle of the similarity. as the third elregel, harmonic triangles are a way to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden middle is a division that appears on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the blood blades of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 13, 34, 13, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 13, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 13, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 13, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34,</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides a liquid supply line when you set up a picture. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-third round, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition takes the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visualised river on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangular area. it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also guided by the above-sided golden spiral. their vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the golden corner. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a tiny triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be plated a static object to dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame and create an effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try to place your photo-focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options flip horizontal flip and flip-flip can be used to mirror the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates an image in which things came around an angle. you can do this with the & publication; image processing and tool-free rotation. choose to use transformative free rotation and jusks the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the sliding angle. the values on this slider are stated in degrees. with the button preferences you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the spin is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse-cursor in the image to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, you can note the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned out an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function transformers to use from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the feature Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option shows the picture a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspeculative transformations are done by a fixture of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares of the corners of your picture. the preview is then automatically recomputed automatically. on the right of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, into pixel.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, into pixel.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little lubricated. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get ingenious triangular holes in the corners. one way of doing this is the picture with transformers cut out of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The vehicle's tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no turning, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can use this module through transforming ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you push for presets, the angle will return to zero. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line ends. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the picture, the picture becomes a bit blurry. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two types of worms twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shedding, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformers out of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& nbsp; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiles. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & checking.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>

<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. thereby, redundant information is reduced to save the image data on an more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save losses if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>

<seg id="850">In case you specify an audio file, in the name of the audio file, it will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your host you can start to drink the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your host you can go quickly or in all tranquility a coffee and enjoy the slides, when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages right down the button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along in standard photosizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened with the imaging Gimp. this is for example, to enhance you or to printing with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command lines dcrab from Dave Coffin. an original sense of Him is: expect from dcrab not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image konverter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button, you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values new to the converting process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the whiteboard used. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue Vermicks can be jushed. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected so you can use the contrastinformation. if your camera in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and used the loseness free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are planning to edit your images frequently or you later otherwise use the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format the metadata that included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">When you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to abort this process again, you can use it to break down.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking machine mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode if you're sure, e.g. by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, here you have the possibility to automatically rewrite the existing file. however, a preview is not available. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to uncompressed all images in an album. it uses the convert convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix to set the starter and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or enlarge. in addition, four types of picture change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the orientation orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): proportions in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportionally: disproportionate share in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation processing: prepares the picture for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photopiers. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images to your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the previous images beforehand. additional pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be drawn and put there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images -window with the images you selected will be displayed. you can add additional pictures to the selected images via the button. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list, and where to add it to you to add the list of images to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of shown images.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. here you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select are attached as attachment attached.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't be careful not to send a lot of images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of the above emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used everytime until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify in the input field below the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer beforehand. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments on the pictures will be added to a text file and add the mail attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among loss free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend that JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you are selecting JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original exifdata will be added to the larger images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down the status messages, looking for errors, see. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button Schleft you can switch this window?</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau appears a window with questions like you want to have your slides. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant image outputs by means of OpenGL. however, you need to own an appropriate graphic card as otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">Display the file name indicates that the filename of images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">This option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually break it with Esc after that.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures selected by chance makes sure the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it's not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">While delaying between the pictures can be set the temporal distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should try this before you show the presentation of your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can select. randomly selects any transition between images another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the didriau, you can access to a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left bottom of the screen, you can view the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module is a tool to put an image as a background image for the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE's surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with remarks you can see with & kative album; see this browses, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you typed information when you look at your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look at EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following, each of them is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you express the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changed. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible. by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view images to view the images of your impact.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kative album; however, for each person to store your own appearance, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button, which is on the right outside the toolbar. in this context, you can select what view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can refer to e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords. (if you do not have appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose to specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed. now you can select the image editor, as shown in the picture. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the enlarge factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image is to be displayed or disedited.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the main window in the main window, you will see a dialog, which is very similar to the dialog for the commemorative of the image properties. this dialog can be seen on the picture one more time.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the lettering or description, the fittings and descriptions of the pictures are searched for. if you wish, you can also enter a date according to which the date may be searched for, i.e., for example, or the complete date. you can also use a section of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kative album; if you don't like reading manuals, but prefer to try out the functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kative album; and take a look at the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & keting album; and choose in the first dialogue the demo, in case you start & keting album; start the first time, or select the menu for the menu entry into the menu item. as a result, some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of & kative album; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & keting album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this Leels shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display you several different time units. each tab shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the list only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interactively use the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview of the database (if you select a date, the timeline always displayed the current date of the moment displayed when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button depressed and drag the mouse over the lineal of the timeline, so draw the timings. if you select a area, you'll just preview images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kative album; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kative album; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the one is described in & kative album; integrated version described you can create via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas content, layout and finish. in the following, each section is exactly described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the song and a description that is to contain the HTML file later. on kative album; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kative album; -export file should be created on the Overview page. nutritional information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, that all images are displayed by a party. note that & kative album; currently all pictures exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain watching.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are clear why this is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions to the pictures. therefore, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants to get an image larger then he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, set the different folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a base folder for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time. you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if they're really all visible for viewers. if you choose to choose a URL for the base folder. if you have created for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you still does not have to copy it into the final destination folder, so that the import-function, see, correctly works you need to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described setup possibilities have all three at basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you specify in the output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking at a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & keting album; however, you might want to write a HTML page to look at the pictures. however, if you have already done a lot of time, pictures, people on the pictures, recording, etc. then you need to do with & kative album; this work doesn't even do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kative album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the BildeiProperties will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored on the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all the images can be stored in the file, and that this file can pass on as independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a two way. first, the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have indicated in creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for the export of images described above the menu file exporting.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialogue is whether it is intended to act internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option manual to copy the .kim file, you must copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically in the vicinity of .kim file copy copy & keting album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already compressed compressed and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do this anyway, simply select the option of export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is a maximum size limit. if you want to send your friends pictures, then the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image is to be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import... select is & katory album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importers consists of four steps. first, you must select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is called to your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog window, which categories of imported file should be imported and which categories do this in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can see the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: when you see pictures, you often want to see pictures of your Italy's holiday and discover a picture with your friend about it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will undergo the various steps from (1) to set up the information about your pictures, via (2) the review and view, through to (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kative album; saves all of his information in the index.xml in the top folder of her images. this is a simple XML file, which you can back with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, backup on a floppy disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kative album; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically. if you want to read another database in & kative album; therefore, another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kative album; using the option -c. as example: kative album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kative album; set up... enter a window by which you can change the settings of & kative album; in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, which you can preview the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help available, which you can call through a keypress to the F1 button and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how to define different properties for each image, e.g. individuals, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to already process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group set up in a group instead of telling all groups of an intermediary like in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setup options available to you, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window you will find a list of the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kative album; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin Interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kative album; but most modules possess a help page which you can access through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kative album. therefore, you should always use new modules first with the demo database. demo-database you can either call via the command line with the command &gt; kative album -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, making it may be that some modules with & kative album; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kative album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums: this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kative album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kative album; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images, which shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the latest album you have to play & kative album; the modules also contained a list of albums. here goes & kative album: as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & katory album; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums. for example, if you want to use the category individuals, for example, if you have chosen individuals to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kative album; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select in the area modules, which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you will see an example of a seat screen as soon as you start & keting album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to using it from any other KDE application, you can see at the top of a menu and toolbar. below the toolbar you can browse the window with which you have entered your image database. at the moment, we'll get back to this window, now click on the entry show that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kative album; is the possibility to see each picture with notes. to include information about the people listed on the picture, where the picture has been recorded, etc. you can apply each image either individually or for a larger number of images to place certain notes at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all images included in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these remarks can be used for seeking and browse as you can read in the section. if you want you can see this note if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists using a text box by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kative album; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of the pictures inside the list: if you have a family celebration and displayed on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can, so that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have any comments on each image individually selected, you might want to edit any selected images and provide these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons, which are at the top of the picture at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. by the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multighter entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that this is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the acknowledgement, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. additionally, you can also take an entry into a category and place it in order to sort out this to an subcategory of this item. attention, this requires you just sort out your category alphabetically. see for this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the feature templates, by clicking on the list that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window-area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... that gives you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely out. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options... and click here to enter the window. see this step in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose to display images in the browser you'll get an overview with thumbnails of currently selected images, or any images in case you have no filters. you can see the size of the thumbnails, by simply clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simple times.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on one image, this will be displayed in the image right. if you have not yet opened a window with a picture of images, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the pictures. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete, or select either the Delete button or select in the Edit menu. now you will see the window displayed in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kative album; it provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use the images stored in your hard drive. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere, so you can record the pictures in the database. in the picture you can see the view of & katory album; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper left is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnail pictures exist, so that & kative album; you can also preview these images, but you can also view these pictures with the image palette.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function takes you to copy files from the folders and copy it again. if you do not want to ask for the installation of the question in question. if you want to avoid anger, such as the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you can easily filter the images that you want for others to be inaccessible and click on Current View privacy. alternatively, you can also view all the images that your little sister can see, contasters and the menu item all except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means you have specified what images are hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, allowing all images that you have blocked, hidden. if you want to get the pictures shown again, click on Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be inserted to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Remember that this picture-protection is not quite safe. at one hand, all images on the hard drive and to the other can anyone who access the password as unencrypted text or delete. this kind of password protection serves only to those who are playing with & kative album; not very familiar to repel the look at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you would like to spend all your pictures with & kative album; of course, manage them at some time. this is why you want to look at them sometime. for this reason it has a picture _ and Videoviewing. you can preview how to start in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he shows of course the image, but additional all the information you enter over the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see it, you can also configure the mouse and discard it. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. the right-click menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to show this. if you click Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were chosen by persons of the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as dilatch. as often, a new image can be controlled by pressing the Strg Taste and Plus or minus. start and stopped the slides by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kative album; it is in full-screen mode to change. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to fullscreen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can drag the image into the image and drawn out. with the minus button you can easily rip a rectangle onto the middle of the picture. shows how a zooming box is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not being zoomed. with the equals key the zooms continues, so each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work in videos are that in and out of zooming with the plus and fold-key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the function functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you view images it can happen that you'll find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the view and enter the configuration dialog of the picture in order to mark these names. however, you'll probably prefer to mark the picture and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want can start the spectator with the images and mark them as good or bad, while you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above there is the opportunity to provide images with characteristics while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view you see an image where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features to your pictures, these are available in the browser. so you can see all images that you edit, print or whatever selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special characteristics can be displayed in thumbnail. if you can display categories in Dre thumbnail, then you can add characteristics to the pictures by simply checking the letters for the character after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you are allowed to draw & keting album; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image but in the database. in the manner you can undone your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In addition, you can see an image painted on the painted. in order to switch the painting mode from the context menu. to end the Malen, simply put the cross in the toolbar on top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must master the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation on & Povray; should you necessarily read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire drawing.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following listing menu will end, so you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click menu of the right button, you can previously remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">When you have modified properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you typed invalid values, a message is displayed with an error message. then you can click the input errors and reapply the changes to aborting it.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; you can enter the dialog dialog, you can view the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help call.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview of your own opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Keep in preview in the self-viewing view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture. as default, the whole texture will have chosen, even if you want to have a subordinated element (for example a texture inside a texture Map and not the entire texture Map), depart local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shifting of pulling with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object as a wire model has a Visibility level. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects will only appear if they are selected or their visual level smaller or equal in the toolbar of the paste.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window regulation as default. the object tree and the view of the object Properties will be shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them manually. you can also save several shutters and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a present view, drag the starter to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends across the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views to each other, drag the starter in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map-map top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window-order are soaring views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the antwater on the desktop or click the little to the left above mentioned arrow in the editor.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the little cross in the editor. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are webportal, you can anchor them to any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window order... save. it is shown a dialog where you can save the window-order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual was written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click on the symbol rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. he determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to create a scene in various image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar, or select View modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, makes sense, but a name that can recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the mapping card size, you can register the width and height of the picture image. if you want only one small area of the image, select the section section and enter the image section of the rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the field of quality you can select the properties that & Povray; for renders use. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of Render properties can be found in the user manual and Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is loaded with just a beam depending on the pixels, different errors can emerge. these images often have a fashion design or on-screen effect in curves and lines, sometimes details are not shown if it is in the presentation of less than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures are better viewed with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn anti-aliasing, computed and linking & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is continually expanding and adaptive because each pixel depends on its calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray a Strahl per pixel. if you adjust the lowering value to 4 pixels with super sampling. if you adjust the lowering value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a repository of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays depending on the pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels. if the difference between the color value exceeds the pre-determined threshold, then the pixels is divided in 4 sub-pixels that can be tracked individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of drugs for beam process, called jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature by & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can adjust if the alpha canals are to be calculated via POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the corresponding rays do not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -Scene to import, select the menu entry file to import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full instruction of & Povray;. if, when imports occur, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can export objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert spring code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renal. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the equity view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation at the displayed object. place the path to your documentation and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example of altimeter) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you'll also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected checks.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the triangle on the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catch of the points on the grid-click menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the buttons for shifts, scalizations and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better rapprochement for the displayed objects, but require more time for renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed diagram for advanced projections, all wire models are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection screens. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and sensitive projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you indicate wall wall, a wall behind the objects is rounded. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a soil below the objects is rounded. the floor is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantending scorching, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of the scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can adjust you. precise information on the parameters can be found in the section Render-modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to modify existing window orders or create new window systems. in the window frames, you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combinatory field standard window: displays all available window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list available window frames shows all available window orders. a new arrangement can create you with the button, and delete a selected order with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views for the chosen window order. new views can be made with the button to add a select views with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unplug the window under the existing window, with a map card you get a selection of cards along with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all the steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners is very popular: a ball on a layer.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should note the following warnings carefully before you complain that you'll get as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for a first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">When you don't set the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert any light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark, and you get just a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all error-free installed, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following presented window types:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please refer to the documentation, so that you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item editing. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular, you notice the scene in the fourth wire-model view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the View properties, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation for & Povray, please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later directions, but note that the camera in view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a check point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you use the button or push the input button, the wire models and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene here from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might want to insert a quader (insert Endal body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reliable method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact offers a simpler way. you can insert an infinite plane as a ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the plane as well, even at the moment only as a limited plane. when you ring the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you view the object tree exactly, you will find that you can view the entry for the ground. in this case, you will find the default options for each new object: scalding, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shifting and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something different at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. you can change the name in the object view (name = soil-pigment), with a click on the button, preview how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment will only show a matured black material because you need to enter the settings for the pigment. therefore, remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on a preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now you take the easiest option now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not have a preview on quota and ball, please click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you are having a click on the symbol now, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the farms. you need to enter two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can do so much more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object Properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should simply run out because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button) so the ball is float above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering results in a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matured black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Invest subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click the ball pigment, select then monochrome and place the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the display images and click on it or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraypricing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you have a scene raytraces, shoots the renderer from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which mirrors the scenes) by each pixel into the scene. the Render calculates how this ray is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects as for example fog. so the scene will be pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye, by which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene, which should be loosed, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you have previously made with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be added to this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a space place.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene has been re-recorded in the last recorded version. all changes since the last store will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only then select if you have not stored stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the most recently revert command. this menu entry can only then select if you have used machinations.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog, in which you enter a name for a new arrangement, or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcuts and standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new links with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands may change or add new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbox. you can add and remove options using this option tooltip for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to modulate noise surfaces, without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a bump map and for a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, by applying a image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewing and web browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can click on the & LMBn; or the key returns.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, type the first character of the file in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a password is highlighted, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by using Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialog inserting - & kuickshow; there are five cards cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two other, short-command for the display window and short-command for the browser, you can set the shortcut for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full-screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust down. default is not a full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, invites & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; in the end the name of the last opened folder. at the next time opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click the coloured beams to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full-screen mode. if in window mode, the window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; so set up that only some of the file types are shown that the program can also be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option is enlarged for large pictures to display the display window on the full screen. this option is switched on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slideshow with the first image is to begin in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time period between the image change in a slide show. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field. the default setting is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of reps is set to 0, the slide show is repeated until they use the user. to change the value, you can use a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Modify here the shortcut for the different modes of operation of & kuickshow; in the mapping cards short-command for the display window and short-command for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option you switch between the two-part view of the filesystem (a window for the subfolder and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the filesystem with folders and files in a window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays big symbols for files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.</seg>

<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way, recently opened projects recharge. the corresponding submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project was already saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog is saved, by which you can choose folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all the opened projects. that's the same as if you want to call it for every single project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and yet it was not saved, asks & K3b; after what has to happen. you can then switch between storing and change. besides, you can also disrupt the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Excludes all opened projects. & K3b; for each non-saved project, what should happen to happen, just as if you were called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all the opened projects and finished & K3b;. for each non-saved project will be asked, what to happen to happen, as if you were called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select the same effect as if you consider the files straight from the top view in the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialogue "burning" to the current project. this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is that? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. he arranges & K3b; files from a previous session to import the current project. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you to see the files already existing in the medium and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function arranges & K3b; to remove imported files from the current project. this function removes no files from the medium, they blinded only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copying dialog. this allows you to create a CD from a CD on another medium. alternatively, you can also only copy one image from a CD which you can then burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of buying instead of normal copying. you should prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialog. this allows even without project file copying a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also use the possibility of a DVD instead of normal copying. also, the target medium will be big enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to the formatting of a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you choose between the typists and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a pre-generated CD-screen. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .ng files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously erset DVD image. the dialog asks you according to a * .iso file as a source of data, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A pre-loaded DVD movie can be transmuted. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be allinactivated. it contains information about the illuminated video, coding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and to cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the specified medium. this information is shown in the content view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of tooling of & K3b; if an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small list is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Push the folder view, or out. the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content is enabled, its contents are displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locking and distorting the running and throw the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Unlock the table view or off. the content is possible to select and pulling files into the project view. the content is also the interface for reading audio- or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Unlock the copying box in the project view or out. the copying box is a narrower realm, which contains only visible when the project view has open projects. the copying box has no real function, it looks just beautiful and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the keyboard agendas for & K3b;. after one of the available commands in the upper part, one can adjust the keynote to it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the K3b; furniture assistant. thus, the proper permissions to burning CDs and DVDs are set. for this, system administration rights needed, therefore you need to enter the password of the wizard for the system manager (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here, general programs may be done. nearly all functions of & K3b should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended to personalize and to be adjusted for the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kgs; -applications also, with a & DCOP; interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality could be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; -functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in terms of function, hence it is more your taste and the way of your task is vital to which the accompanying program you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we suppose that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; -functions to use, you need to make sure that & K3b has started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; -program have in common, supported & K3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; puts functions like copyCD, formatted DVD and more features for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef create.DVDProject () DCOPRef create.DVDProject () DCOPRef create.DVDProject () DCOPRef create.DVDProject () FCOPRef create.DVDProject () FCOPRef create.DVDProject () FCOPRef create.DVDProject () FCOPRef. Dvd () Fed Dvd () void burncdImage () void burncdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: D3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3b K3bInterface currentProject Durch using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only available on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) contains void Beurl (KURurl, Qstring Parent) is void of VveItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data-project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data-project, multiple folder and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createB3b K3b K3b K3b K3bInterface createtorder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addatel / home / delity / somefule.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD are read, read and stored in WAV files on the machine (lossy free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step this WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format, or other formats such as lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step that read the & CD; it is used by & caudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggpreto (for OGG) or other encoders have already been installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything themselves. however, only the code that is not used is needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodist / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiers gives a small introduction of codenerer, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be made (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), it will be explained the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, about which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already lit file is selected for code instead of having a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog for the type of alerts (such as protocols, Piepsen) for programmer (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the primary dialog dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different mapping cards (such as encoder, to set up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss free audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information is losing through data composing according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG can have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences will be less important because both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be delivered with most distributions free of distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high until very high quality quality (with high rates of bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deep bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playequipment is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-stereo systems. today - initially in 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset media '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music.</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer greater transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate roughly 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car-stereosks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without taking any consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are collected manually or fetched via the program automatically from the freeDB are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names, as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-operation programs, there is often a combination of programs for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the codes declare the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s should be coded with lame, the switch -set of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this:... -tt {title}... '.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CD to upload the information, so that all the others may download information instead of themselves into the machine. it's to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm. of the user) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music businesses are inflicted. all information can be obtained in case of a bummel through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiaudiocreator; it is active to choose an address environment (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address while invoking the data from the server is not used (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; if it is designed to use freeDB, the geographically will be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrams for online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in search source... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the illuminated WAV files, the codile and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at first Open are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossy-free compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the code. other kitchenettes can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the codification is required. this is also necessary for the predefined encoding. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame help or lame --help in a consolder window (eg; Console). in doing so, 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reader desires, and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio code of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; read out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps for average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There have to be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame may be found as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can naturally always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have screened writing (eg by trying to copy something into the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section is the basic frame of & audiaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what must be repeated for any read & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used code for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with, the freeDB to use the & CD; data from the Internet Download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read a & CD, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / CDROM there is a symbolic link to the actual device-drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the equipment for the & CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The mapping card General settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incompleteness information will be selected so that you will be informed when details of the reporting of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map card; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD have automatically downloaded over the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine needs to be connected to the Internet for reading the & CD; to connect to the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry was found immediately if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the filesystem or filename is changed by Conqueror- &gt; renaming and the ID3-tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to note: if you want to manually enter the selection fields and freeDB is not used. however, this about 620 MB large, consider it twice whether this is worth to use freeDB at the Offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following selection map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path, the load between the machines will be distributed. however, this attitude will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as many firewalls are releasing the protocol 8880 default, maybe more happiness with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to provide any & CD; data to the freeDB server forward. the first activation field should be off.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously payouts: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time are using only an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">"" "CD; after reading the last piece: they crucify the" "" "CD" "" "at the end of the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you sign this one, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files is available. if only space is stored on another drive, the files will not be put in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All just enter as it is in the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something must be attached to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags at version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2' tags you can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' meeting for & kde; in case of a later change in tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of WAV files simultaneously: with a dual core or squares, or even a multiprocessor machine, more than one WAV file can be tried at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic establishment of & audiaudiocreator; ended. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD. when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, how the process of reading the & CD is run. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music on the hard drive is organized, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB is described, must be repeated for any read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not included in freeDB, see the screen photos a little different from the data required for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually enter, rather than fetching it from the Internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD must now be defined into the press, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, just as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; used as an audio CD; and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up, successfully picked up by the freeDB, all songs of the pieces are already filled out, and the name of the artist and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key to your & CD; gives, a window appears, and you can select the database entry, that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the indication of the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, you need the access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - entering the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD, according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Upeller Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be typed in the input field 'Upeller title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidicaps per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limit the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have an unlimited field-length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum. this option is set up on the tab labeling settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked off. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out. make sure all pieces are selected, or pressing the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: contract 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, follow and code parallel. notice the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that can be configured is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in weak machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 does not seem to have any problem with simultaneous expression and code (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded and a third order is on the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from one & conqueror; -window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bed the button to play in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu piece or pressing the blank button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it on the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then playback each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the tempo display and so change the conversion speed. to get back the original speed, double-click the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space-button has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the space button or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece, so interrupts playback. if you play the space-button while no piece is played, starts & kmid; die playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music. some pieces use textiles, others use songwriting and again others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the Ereignistype will automatically identify which a song has to be selected, so you do not have to select the karaoke text automatically. however, you still have the possibility to change this, if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a Ereignistype, select from the menu settings the entries of text and songevents. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these will be played by series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, open first the collection manager. find this in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and give the name to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the requested information in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">To the temporary collection all songs you want to not want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection is not saved. keep in mind when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the button. once again, the file dialogue will be able to choose the one you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic additions to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic added to the collection is activated, a piece by opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic added to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and, this collection will then continue to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager to choose the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are replayed. if you choose the series to choose from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, choose the next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song vice versa, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece out of the menu piece or press the button left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To clear a collection, open the collection manager, choose the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, as it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-compatible. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translates into events that synthesizers are synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all the events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet when the piano should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. awe - and CIS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all the needed compositions for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section is allowed to appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is to have a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as E-Mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be available for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI appear on your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left-left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM will be in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all notes which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a gun powder. to make this enter the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (defenses), it takes less 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound is a different perussionment (drums, basin, maracas & etc;), and not the one where the tone is the pitch of always the same drummers (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP segment, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to form notes on the screen TV channel. take a look at the keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, simply make it easy in CHANNELMAP segment.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for Keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is pictured on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file name. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, more and more patch x uses.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the beater patch on the screen on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates whether a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch using the value, this is recalled to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only then transmitted. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file there are no decimal mas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch format with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pions (one for each MIDI channel). on these piviatures see what sounds are played on.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button doesn't have any more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views in order to show the mirrored tones. view in the menu settings below the point of the channel view: setting</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed when playing a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So you can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file requires a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a trusting distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; without awe support compiled. to remove the problem you need to download an source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do not agree to & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add to & Conqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"" "activate the" "" "automatic added to the collection" "" "to the collection, otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD, to slow down the playback. to reactivate the standard tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've been on a & kde; -desktop a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; in this way I have to play a karaoke file or I want to play a file, just switch to the & Conqueror; drag window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen quickly a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic adding to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so place the automatic add to the collection and open A.E. to your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock yourself, play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me to program & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends substantially on your soundcard. it's not the same whether you use a FM-device or a awe card.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferential connections with the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played by each other, you should use the category continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical memory. if you have an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories's current piece ', television and continuous playlist files can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & kmplayer; you can change the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer /, but also by the application itself. to simply click on a name of a category click, therefrom the menu view and next editing mode. through the clicks of a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose the same with playlist, or choose another category, or another category will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the disk mode are left or a different group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and turning can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / export / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starten does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would bother at the end-animation, however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photo: & lt; bodywork; & / / home / mum.gif "fit = / / / home / mum.gif" fit; / smilts; / smilts; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the player and the cache size of the filesystem from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be played for the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Hence the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages may be able to reproduce the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the MIME-type B / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file allocation of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The konqueror or & kmplayer; can start in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console on the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus getting a given backend for a particular MIME type (obviously only if this has been identified), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonemphonemwrote all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV Cards, either using the player or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner device and TV channels need to be configured. to this, the scanner is used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configuring the VDR (Video Data Rekorder) settings in kmplayer is to use dialog in settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one selected encoding must be found (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB contained therein.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only available on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux will need to function in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMplayers for the sources different names. at the time of origin of this documentation, this will be dvdnavsource, dvdesource, tvdscanner, tcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint like I can do my CDROM drive, if I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / CDROM is to run as user root after adding the device. it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / CDROM displays on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. latex; submitting the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; -file has been created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer for the appropriate line in the latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the format document and other information such as font, or latex; there are many tools for view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and smell.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the ROI file, the elements of the DVI; -file chopped with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; source code is embroidered, the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the latex; source code has been clicked, becomes the corresponding position in the DVI; viewers.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a Master document the work with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide Master document is set to set up project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">High-speed: the latex; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if no error in the source code exist).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File recovery: in this mode, the DVI; file will be used on the "" "" blower "" "" and it is not a call of & ocular; after the quick installation. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1769">When contemplating the edit toolbar, the three large-of-the selected elements of the document should be developed for the fast delivery of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections... the sub-adjustable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop-down box is for the addition of articles such as tags, fox, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed term (selection a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries. for the editing of & bibtex; files are corresponding editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author can also be written in & kile; the author can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-out with the name GraÃ ¶ e is used for defining the font. it can be defined as the main text, the Fuels banknotes, etc. it is the following sizes to apply:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When you call & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Brackets after the command\\ of the class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] establishes the font. if the font should not be set at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code sample has to be entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before the compile. & kile; for storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fail, should be searched for errors in the log process. when using quick installation, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font should have been created. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ by {environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The types are only available within the area (of\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no signpost (number) for the type inside an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to educate the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it can, for example, certain fonts, liftment, couplings, submissions, etc. in the end of the environment. these commands either end with the\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course pressure and is long as long until he is closed with a\\ by {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be illustrated with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the latex; -pronunciation, follows now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once assistant was typed a bit text, a few adaptations to the better readability of the document should be completed. at least one quote, a few places in the fat and courier pressure and a poem come to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor's view or Ctrl may return to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply test and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an additional file format (engl. D e V ice I nado). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi issue such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Umwandler or computer screen monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar set the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; -file was created from the latex; -source code can begin the conversion in penetrated other formats by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">Explore the direct jump from the editor to the actual position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binz files. for this purpose only Modern is set up under settings Kile... tools are needed.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To look for the preliminary search, the mouse-cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and will be clicked on forslick on preferences. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewers will then be done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; -document of & kile; shall be drawn up and the corresponding line. to this end, & kile; used as a text editor (settings Oepieve... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the activation of quick aculture of the & DVI; viewers do not wish to have a mistake. if a mistake has been made, it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file indicates the error source in the source code. in the editor you can refer to the errors in which the error appears. in order to view the faulty line must be clicked on the error in the log file and & kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document. the possibilities presented are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a piece of document, a document can either be written or used for quick creation of a new document. further information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Household users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates are allowed in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, must be created either an existing & tex; - / latex; file format or a new file must be created. & kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file, some string quettes will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing). these variables can be set in settings Kile... Settings</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering documents. typically they will be used as follows:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps has been taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can create a template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any one & latex; a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are available.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate; and his opportunities to learn the manual should be attracted at Kate. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter on the Editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference. you may find an adequate description of virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with penetrated Strg button to train the & tex; meaning that in this way the clicking on\\\ by\\\\\ are merely\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker button, the text will automatically be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with penetrated Shift key, parts of the source code can be washed out in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; it has the ability to browse various kinds of source texas and to highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be included in the text box. these are your own kind of bookmarks within the text. the jumping mat or the corresponding jumping brand. thereby, this jump brand is highlighted, so that it is automatically displayed in the first entry of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The machining is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile; although Kate; excellent features for writing a & latex; source texts have always been added; special commands for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included in the text output:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Waged a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph, there is not a text associated with pertinent lines (as in other text-ditches). this advanced meaning may not be taken from the source using tables, latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventative thing in & kile; is thus that the sections are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word is under the current curryposition. this selection has also an advanced meaning, since this command will also latex; commands with a beautiful star (*) and an additional star (*).</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example a part of the document can be removed from above all, and by drama the button def is removed. & Kate; offers the entire line removed. & kile; offers with its own commands, for example, the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Deletes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description of machining in paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarifies that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore it offers & kile; available NF more commands under machining space for easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command is embroidered to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command is embroidered to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command\\ begin of the environment}, becomes the end of the area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many traineated Environmenting commands can quickly be lost to the highest view. this command fell asleep most of the last, so that the left-left ambient structure is not being distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the latex; -groups, which are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from machining environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command to the start of the current group is embroidered (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the weighted clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command to the end of the current group is embroidered (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the slider clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor before or behind the weird clamp of a & tex; -group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many traineated groups-brackets can quickly be lost to the highest view. this command fell the last cooked group, so the vanished structure of the & tex; -groups are not being dismissed.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-signs (amp;) to each other. if this Tabulator is not the perverse, for example, and kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current taboo.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already developed a good source code transcription, these two modes (usually for & latex;) still expanded. there are three according to requirements and the other two are for automatic reliability. all these modes can be set for different ways of working under settings Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1839">In the beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {surroundings} will & kile; automatically add the command\\ by {surroundings} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">In the DrÃ ¼ cke of the RÃ ¼ button, the last letter of the input is removed and will be confused by the default list. on the other hand, the list may also be reduced by entering an additional letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, you can choose from & kile; even diving brands will be introduced, so that a simple jump to these positions by editing ankhest jumping mat is possible and the parameters used can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; furnish... kile; they can be done to these lists. you can choose different types of designs, and & latex; commands, as well as weaves of the general language-to-use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not available for performing environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of transcription mode will result in a large list of ambient mode. on the other hand, the environments are often used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments to be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1844">With the call of the translocation mechanism or the keyboard shortcut mode, the command will be frozen automatically and it appears to\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient can be continued in the easiest way and through drama the input will be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has accomplished, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list of surroundings, it is even a first\\ item command with frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; furnish... kile; adjustments can be made for these lists. this mode uses the partial list of the default mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supported user-defined lists of abbreviations which can immediately be replaced by default string. the lists can be set up under settings kile. as an example of a breakdown list, the file example.cwl, included, for example, included the entry L =\\ LaTeX for example.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Is inserted, for example, the letter L input and the word completes the menacing mode, or the keyboard shortcut mode is introduced, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large ones are not helpful for automatic reliability. however, it has been determined that many mares in a document can be written more than once. thus, & kile; the expiration for all is already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menù Settings Kile... Kile Versions can be set off. here, the corpora value can be determined for the display of completion.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but they offer an excellent basis for the documents and rearrangement of pages. will use the PDF output, so you can re-arranged the pages with a few & PostScript; -tools to be re-arranged and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the outcome of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the menu creating compiling, creating and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for beviewer such as & ocular; or the further transformation can be used the keyboard. after that, the DVI; -file can be converted to a PS-file and be viewed by the old; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command-building, it is usually called a spectator after compiling. should not be used in a wired observer, so each time becomes a new window.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. however, this attitude here will be derived from the same in the projector, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regularly backup copies, so that with a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored by this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for even stored documents, a backup is regularly created, accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1979">A view in which the debugger issue is displayed (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger is necessary, if necessary, or it shares the plug-in with, on debug requests. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, that a debugger is not required to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the sounds to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to direct the server for a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the surveillance variables as well as the currently executed line continuously. if this happens when the script is stopped, the execution continued. happens before a debug request was started, the script starts with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the script without sending information to the variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script is stopped, the execution runs, starts execution as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or features.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next statement in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes it will be redeemed.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger to move the statement and go to the next so if there would be the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the overhauled value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to input can also be diverted to the output of the specified application. there are two types of issue: normal issue, directed to default output; it can be specified what is to happen to the default output written, by set the value the drop-out issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to set the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use their use, enable dialogue "day edit" when available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action represents better, we will & kiconedit; use. choose from the & KMenu;, chart other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starter button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as loose, stared, further interpreted), or should at least to be signaled a message to the user that application of this symbol is a & lt; startled; -tag in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol there is still to be connected to the action. this is going through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text field there is one button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the applied button and continue using other tags, so there are still which, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some common & quantaplus; functions on toolbar or it should be provided for better overview through some separators into several groups. open the toolbox set dialog on settings tool. make sure that the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to the toolbar, push the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proofing of all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored imregular folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user the opportunity to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository If anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create the docrc file. then you need to let the docrc file. let's let the second part we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file (Tree] Doc you = path, relatively to this file, to the documentations of text files e.g. by Section1.html Section 2 = Section1 html 2 = Section10.4.2.2 = Section10.0 = Section10.4.2.2 = = tag # 1 = tag 1.html 5 = day. html 1 = day. html 5 = day.</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now look at the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level of the Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of content = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess room (apart from reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consistently logical at the top end of the component view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; symbols. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources and resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file, which is to be shown on the design of the context sensitive help. by flagging the function and drag of Ctrl; H for context help, documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of by benign separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc on your file docrc / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Netanta / doc / crop / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and well worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation were used at the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be richly rich, but proud to have worked with the best web developement platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the dispenser resources (DTEP packages, tooling with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email sending menus, like DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP), send an e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users will be reviewed and made available only when our team needs them as accurate and usefully for publishing. to make an easy contribution to what there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later user.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can have a look out. in the dialogue New resource need to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and hit the uploading of OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree are started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages which is currently not created by & quantaplus; however, creating a DTEP package will be necessary because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in the day-XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD shop and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. then, the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that will appear in the! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / looml4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning the DTEP after conversion: when activated, bringing & quantaplus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first teach them these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapSaul, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaport; uses, available. of tooling about promotions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to provide different tooling, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then available everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tooling. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to tools with special actions specifically reserved for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the sharing of special tools and patterns made by all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaport; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the building views, the carlodges with information and the tooling. please hit in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the caro-leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentary entries, such as close the current, other or all cartoonist, reuploading, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing of the mouse under the mouse-cursor or opening the file when the string are referred to as a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensteiner there is the tooltip of the Editors. at present & Cantaplus, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of tool tools is demonstrated. in the course of further construction of & quantaplus, the tooltool will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tooling is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in their document then click on the symbol that the tag represents. if they want to insert the data for this straight day. if they want to insert the data for this straight (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The builders (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and wander. in the presentation with carloaders are available for files, project, model documents, documentation, attributes, and documentation components.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantapSaul. this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like adding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be performed with the click context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. it offers all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on & quantapSaul. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. the right mouse button includes further functions, such as the script to start, edit or send e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through the right-clicking of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree will open.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with it, manquickly attributes and namespaces may change. the result is the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development. you can download pre-paced documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; to create a document on a project, and by adding a folder doc, a project may be added, edited and looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two carediers at the bottom of the window, via the beneficial information can be achieved: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartoonist displays information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This caro-maker displays all errors in the up-up of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; Toolkit are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate site of tooling is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as zipped Tar-Archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can make it in & quantaplus, as any other secure and download!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; to adjust to autoconf file on your system. to get a complete list of all options, give. / configure --help one. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 I am folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE-surface. & quantaplus, was optimised for a rapid web development and combines a matured development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; to create the developers of & quantaplus; to deal with a close idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a peculiar, extensible Markup Language editor? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">It is no longer limited to pure & HTML, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim has to be held that & quantaplus, as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer's community is based. & quantaplus, follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -Scope is not only this possible, but allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to make use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. through the program, they can make it & quantaplus. (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web developmental environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast design development and quickly became a well-designed editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Canta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details about the documentation is with help: / quanta (either these URL in & Conqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta perform).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developing and supervised by Eric Laffix sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not located, whereby the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template, only a bug will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts with inserting from the clipboard contained there are special characters to the & HTML; -write so that it is displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a form of form.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -letter which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Locks the blockers to or from. this allows you to choose text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script errors are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with the GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the news window to or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scriptions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and switching of the problem-up on the bottom of the & quantaport; main driver. the problem-reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the agent in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file @ webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">The project directory searches for new files that could be there. that allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder, and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Setting, such as & quantaplus; the Project manages. in Chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details declared.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbar and are only in this menu when you have allocated them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that's created just the name. actions must be added by means of settings. tooling are saved over tool tooling, or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbox.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete them from your hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">With this you can send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaport; -team to allow the toolbar available in the next release). the menu item opens a new EMail message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it is sensible when the entities from the & DTEP; to renew. if this is global and a writing table in the global KDE folder is not present, the charging does not fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) Toolbar is loaded, there are in the tags menu a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disable the intelligent inserting of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion by means of toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plug-ins listed under the above mentioned menu items are activated. click. click on a activated plug-in activates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the synonyms mode for the current file. the list of available entry schemata depends on derminate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application of tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate detaching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the reversal sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics. recommended is the display card mode, which is also default, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting a single one, the corresponding subwindow is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaport; headstones at or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application that use the KHTML Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directed the behavior of the Editorfensteiner. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbox or which can change and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an aid in accordance with the model of the mouse cursor, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as after filling out the project named the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project Project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemp.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project. it is a relational path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder instead of the standard will be set.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolkit are stored for the project. it is a relational path to the project and by default toolbar. when a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder instead of the standard will be set.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This attitude is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files are to be integrated somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is started anew. if a project is started from scratch, not appealing.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of apprails.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by means of attachment, or by removing the tick-chambers from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded with project properties in the menace window in the subwindow, or using the shortcut shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder is possible), which can be viewed newly in project-related operations such as projections.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplemental option too above, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project is loaded and more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The debugger can be chosen. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in case the debugger is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, uploading profiles can be adjusted, as well as the display of a component view for the content of the server for each profile, by displaying an own component view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list, see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration you can switch to event actions and add these actions, change or delete. events actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs, such as the siders of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select a project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog's dialog is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project structure gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening... in with the right mouse-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the files uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button will stop down to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten by programing. this possibility is useful when common uploading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the plate does not appear in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantapSaul, many high profile profiles can be uploaded and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto different servers. when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied, either a fully-qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the record, so it cannot be easily read, but each with programming language can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tooling. there can be a lot of views in a project, i.e., by simple exchange of view, multiple files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tooling.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible via settings tool toolbar, or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which you most have to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also enables the adaptation of & quantaplus, to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are tooling in & quantaplus; best about the menu toolbar. use and add add to add Toolkit will be handled below in the section adding.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tooling and the icons can be set in either using the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with new action toolbar, other actions like toolbar can remove, toolbar renaming or toolbar set out, which can be specified in dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, you will also remove the entries and processed action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tooling and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tooling... to set up settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document-reduced, code carving and files for shortcuts. & quantaplus; uses basically like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or move into the system's existing directory in the template. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set up for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms used at the beginning of each template, prior to using it.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents by shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template-tree under global templates. for more information about the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. it makes a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organising the work in a proper way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template-tree under global templates. see for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area always should be inserted in the documents. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As its name says, these templates will serve for entire websites as templates. you are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a zipped tar archive. at present there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select file as a template as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project position) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template among project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a template store selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with dragging and derive into the designs.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a template folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as dragging and derive or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on the file tree or in the repository files to create a folder on the right and backup site template. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; create, create files or link with them. in addition, you can keep some things in dealing with templates, in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files created in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / rectangular / quanta / templates / templates / quanta / templates /</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a folder in the template review, with the right mouse button, click the folder and choose in the context menu characteristics. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is disbanded as soon as Elterous attributes is halted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fit for everything except the regular folders. if a master folder would be set in principle, unless they were explicitly activated. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-stone. if nothing appears, you probably find themselves in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to set up or set up text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying content into a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate Headlines / Headlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the right-click menu (indicating your right mouse button) on a full command collection of folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor that covers the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch when needed to the source code, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; source code. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the VPL; config editor is already active, this mode is already active, the keypress puts the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source Editor is set to set about settings Quanta. by selecting VPL; for selection, you can choose between synchronization by one click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation is to be adjusted for fast computers and a big spanish for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tools to choose document properties. thus, the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor will also be called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to change the suspension of suspension. thus, one can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet searchengines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons on the list or delete. a change about the list is accurate as with the Meta-elements. the editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style by clicking on the file-opening button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the agent is as usual in a text processing, due to account with the arrows, possible. at rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and delete or removing taste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The inserting of tags will be done in the same way via toolbox, as in the source code editor. it is to note that the inserting of tags previously already existing identical tags not removed e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded by text, everyone needs to be removed each other umber anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool modes such as the tables assistant or the lists are deactivated. they will later work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists are to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of style templates. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style of style can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The compilation was very complicated, because one of the most frequent changes made and simultaneously corrected to many places the reverse. a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a number of conflicts throughout.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the back-back had changed. that's the result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a row and make changes to white character. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and add it to one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and composite of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way guide will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons independently manage each other at a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to solve conflict and demonstrates the result at the same time. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files together:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-assembled:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and in this way the possibilities of current colour monitors. if you often need code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance on the summary in the column on the left side. (no anger more, if someone changes the capture.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files are the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the tipside by just writing the file name in the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "kdiff3 folder-1 folder-"" "" folder-2 "" "" folder-2 folder-" "" "Ordinary Exner1 folder-2 folder-3" "" "folder-2 folder-3" "" "folder-folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows the manual type of filenames containing the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a most recently opened file from the list. you do not have to specify third file; if you have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences is performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or merge from folders. if for A file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If it is merged, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file. you can also finish this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The direct button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening-dialog, you will need to select no files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dragging, just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would have to load only two appropriate files, put them in & kdiff3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't pull anything from & kdiff3; only the case of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program as compensation and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional). (when the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source sets are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preference settings can be changed by the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color that file differs. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (bring together) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programmers, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + for example, white signs only appear in strings and comments, for the seressor and in a few, seldom items relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the merger column from the text, is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line-change is activated, the line is displayed on a broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison table) also has a info line with the wording:, the filenames and [geography] if you have processed the result. usually it contains the automatic running already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is downlighted!!! (use the buttons springe to next to stem / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparators are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also indicate a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group becomes the current group of background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic edit or through manual editing no more line is left in the group; then this is only a placeholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you might want to copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; converts; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go gently with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you choose the sources to ignore or ignore the Options / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly associated with the pictures and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are used in one of the windows, you can use the arrow buttons, right, high, down, page on, page starting, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the Overview column can also be used by clicking also to the Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other keys for editing. using the insert button, you can switch between insertion and overboard mode. (default, the insert mode is set.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the concatenate columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section and explains the editing window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-bottom / Strg-above), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Figures / Strg-Figure) or the next / previous conflict (Strg-Figures) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, note that & kdiff3; all not automatically solved conflicts also after the manual, therefore needs to be distinguished between dissolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you must press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl inserts). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically to the clipboard and manually copy the manual. be careful with this option, as you might accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Shows are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix-variants use a newline sign\, and Win32-based systems use car-replenishment\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line of the source files not with, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved when starting, and the next start is restored. (menu Settings- &gt; Kwid3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in recursive script. if the chosen document does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be replicated. on these systems, the button preferences automatically shows an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tabulator button. otherwise, a tabular character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press the input or return, the filing of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied into the clipboard. the manual is copying into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which pointer type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files. the second step compares each line. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. even when combined, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon mark '\'. usually ignored & kdiffuse '\'. usually ignored & kdiffuse, but then files might be activated with different sizes in side-on-side comparison, though they might be different. if this option must be deactivated, however, this option must be disabled. in default, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default this option is downlighted. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and pertinent characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences will nevertheless be displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default this option is downlighted. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white character.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive looking for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and big files, but slowly with very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-jump mode, this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Does automatic all conflicts arise in white signs by using the selected file as a source. (submitted is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need to use this only from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or have enabled Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning from folders and circulating of a compilation. see for details under the documentation for the directory-comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is displayed the Suffix .orig. if already such a backlog file with the Suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set over there over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you have enabled this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding appears a short notice, which is local coding. (this can not be modified here and has for you purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting it. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Once you have edited a file, you can specify which coding for storing ought to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing instructions, you might not be able to function with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the editor-in command can only use with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre-editor.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress Hervorings of changes in white characters in the text or overviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring figures or enabled Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed. after a selection of A & lt; s; B, A & lt; -s; C, or B, gt; C will be shown next to the normal nor a second check-in column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. blending the less important windows. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Type the same window next to each other or overthrowing. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide how to merge the files together. a simple click will also compare two files. (when this function is used to restart the file name, then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the instruction is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preference, which is exactly your needs. you can use this function e.g. to cut trouble-breaking parts or to correct the capture.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, they will first be handed over to this external command (see above), then the edition of the instruction is used only when the command is used. you can write your own pre-processor that is exactly your needs. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program the self. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl fully suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-editor for drawing up in large letters: sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ 1 /\\ (. *\\) /\\ 1 in the creation string, the\\ U converts the found text into upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Therefore, CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert text chains (info: / CVS / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $\ _ BAR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '\'\ '\'\ 's list. the\\' s $\ 'is needed because $is a special sign and end of line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a already built-in function in Kwid3. however, it is good as an example of another test editor for drawing abnet. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each matches will be replaced by nothing, so be quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the settings from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement 'allerdings are needed at perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the set'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and managing. further operations only alter the data that the line-off-Algorythmus can change.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-up preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can't accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate this can simulate and displays the simulated changes without really perform them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... results selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar. you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then Ordinary folder is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not match this together, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the filing of the folder you will inform a small news window on the current progress. if you break the scan of the folder, only files are listed, which were compared to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and any folder that has been found during the scan will be presented here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking on the object to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and list all subdirectories with which you can catch all the folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Click on a file, the file will be started and there will be a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the dates in the first folder (a). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in the different folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the contraception action cannot be automatically selected, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above image, you are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical deposits, the colour is also identical even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then the folder also have the same color. at folders, the age is unsignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow gets yellow, and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying from B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy from C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to sync is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are used. then, & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folder are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the result is copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option will be activated instead of plugging (unsure), then the same date appears, then the same date appears. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the result will merge a file after the other. it's status column shows Finish one when the result was successful, and correspondingly other reports, when something failed. if the result is completed, you should make a final review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog, the file comparative analysis is chosen, Kdiff3 more columns is displayed. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for redeemed conflicts is displayed only when three folders are compared or assembled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all contracepstakes (even in all subfolders), you can run it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then three-folder mode will be used as a target in three-folder mode, B is selected as a target and used for synchronizing A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped in the folder structure. check out these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To run all entries: select directory-guide / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut) only to run the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting data types still exist invalid actions exist, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialogue window will appear with the options departing, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you only want to see what would happen without the actual changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then results certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a composite window will open (check the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again directories / continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next entry continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; to make a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, note & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and performs it when later, all entries have been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries are again merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings-menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Killing 3...) has now a section called directory-assembling with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. folders do not correspond to that pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?' default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?' default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / CVS / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems files are a transverse attribute. in other filesystems, a forward point. a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">On Links to Files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to the folder: when the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; do not check on possible recurrencies. a link to a folder of a link itself would lead to an end-loop, and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare large folders using a slow network, it may be faster to compare the amendment date and file size. however, this speed is a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is downstream in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly as confidential the changel date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical. that can be useful when copying the amendment date has been lost. please use caution. this option is downstream in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enabled the synchronize mode if two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions are being identical to that both folder are identical. also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered uncertain as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original backup file will already exist with the .orig extension, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder-merge contents are visible to the merge individual files; you can switch to the window-dividers with the mouse. if you do not want to share the window list window and change the main window in the window menu and switch the change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking on. however, you can create a single file directly without the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be brought together once you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will however be lost if you check the directory again: list menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a zipped archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or.. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be trained. (# - &gt;% 23, blank lines &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or the change of change from the original. (note the option trusting the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main uses is currently known as the distinctions of viewers in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in-built differences in the viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference between the viewer and then select In Kid 3Part display in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Killing 3Part. please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files has changed since the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part of being executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that merge or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heis it compare). besides, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diffuse 3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs for quite a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who go this way or going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have notified the program from the sources and the configure script probably not notify the right prefix to KDE. in the default configuration, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (eg. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is considered to be not identical. IF similar lines of the next to each other, this netis, but this is the case of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. this important information is lost though, if the result is simply saved as a text file, and it is much effort to design extra its own file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too big. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to deal with larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src linear; released and the text does not allow itself to delete. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to distinguish from differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from game Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or new.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For more information on how to use Kwid3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of the latest changes you will find below http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the file Changelog in the quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; compile and install on a system using & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Strg-V or Shift) adds the text from the clipboard to the current disk position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Display just differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program you will have to update the folder with the function Refresh) after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. that also results in the target folder. if the target folder these files does not already contain, they are missing after that. (the behavior will be altered in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on the selection of the source with lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed while clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is downlighted. Understanding in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white character.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a minishow of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop surfaces, to change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moves on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move window within & kpager; moving. the movement is possible within a desktop and other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on, if on the empty background of & kpager; chewing, the context menu has only compiled two entries in Pager. if, however, the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries will be minimizing, maximizing, ups and representations. the commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this crossover is marked, window within the & kpager, can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the & kpager is displayed; the names of the virtual work surfaces are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Indicate this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual work surfaces. is it together with name to display, the names will be supplied with folder, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as a small window in & kpager; otherwise, only the empty spaces are shown to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is selected the view of the program window. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program module. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager is determined: classic makes & kpager, as well as from Pager applications appear in some other windowmanners; wathes shows all virtual work areas in a horizontally and vertically positioned in a vertical range, which is very good for the viewing on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager: can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-program in the checkbar. it has the advantage that it can be altered in the size, display the window as symbols or with its content and can move outside the checkbar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & kpager; and subsequent selection from the switch devices... allows the dialog settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in dialog settings: but you can manually do it manually:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmouthool; emulates a mouse-click, as soon as the mouse-cursor a while on the same place. it is meant to help people who emulate the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and each mouse-click hurt. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this does require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousettool; can handle the pain that comes with the mouse on the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also cause pain that are connected with the use of your computer, you should have a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify things once more: even if & kmousetool; pain that helps when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the mouse due to the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids, the outcome can vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & moumousettool; is simple: & kmousettool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the movement out.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent deactivation power, makes & kmousettool; a break after getting the mouse button down. move the mouse, waiting until the end of the mouse, before the slogan means executing the mouse button. this smart moving requires a little practice, but you get used quickly on it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This refusal time has to be petrified after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousettool; a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If smarter switched on, the turnaround is switched (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & kmousettool; after downloading the mouse button, after downloading the mouse button, no account for the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousettool; now its function is activated, generates a slow payment because of right and back, followed by a break, by a click with the right mouse button. a slow way for left and back leads a double mouseclick. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousettool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound falls out, you can & kde; to move the reaction time to shorten. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you can set at a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setup is marked, it will run & kmousettool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently available only under & kde; please drag the respective documentation to the rate to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values returned when opening the dialogue. have you already pushed down the button, the settings will be put back to the status of the last drop of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best to use & kmousettool; first of all use the default settings. in particular, the intelligent deport should be switched off at first. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart tanning.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds too.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which does not represent a link, does not lead to unknown reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is rugged, you should clean your mouse. it is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse-ball but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, it varies from mouse to mouse. but it should be quick if you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily be scraped with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the design of & kmousettool; if just a move started out. if you would like to use the intelligent deport, this means that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer due to the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousettool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse-click. this is set back by the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousettool; continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. but don't leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to create a keyboard shortcut. so it can cause a formal review of mouse & eg. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray surfaces to the tooling and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart tanning, but I didn't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetter; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it's very well possible to copy it into the clipboard and to add any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button. but there will probably be some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent shifting not when you start to use it just as follows: perform a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the switch button pushed, while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and place the mouse-mouse again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes every sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when using smart moving the dilaptimes begins. later you can use the smart moving even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousettool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a soundcard and speaker, and that is correctly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetter; pressing the mouse button soon as the mouse-cursor. this program was designed for people who suffer from the RSI's syndrome and which is preparing the toiling of the Maule's pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that it is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse-mouse will start. in this way, the dragging and descended with the mouse can be done.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text will be processed, before he is sent to the programme speech-dispatcher. they are useful to improve the pronunciation to select false words or abbreviations to select a matching language and speaker or to circumvent certain deficiencies of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech dispute" works with a text. & ktts; sets four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers have the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps this orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg. processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these assignments will be resumed after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you are looking for a long text on a website, you can welcome someone with & kmouth; anyone who is entering the room. & kmouth; -alerts are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text calls. each order that you encounter from the check-card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text presentations. text calls are intended for issuing longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are labeled in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. when an application reads the output of a screen record, during & kta; just such reading, this edition is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters never apply to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text presentations, as well as on & kde; -news applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and enter it on the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future, there can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace pieces of a text by other text. you can specify either as words or as regular expressions. it is supplied with predefined filenclosures as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding possible.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from a format to a different format. in delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translation by & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker optionally you can send orders depending on the content of the text or subject to the program that sent the text on & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have set up a female voice for example, you can read text of KDE messages about it. Siehe can read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter determines that his rules don't apply, he gives the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & b; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filter that were created on the page below. the processing by the filter is carried out in order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the standard filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filters are worked in the series following from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and it will be displayed further below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the installation of strings, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. will these patterns be found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement parts. big and small, when compared is not observed.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter your filter for a name. you can choose this name as you wish, he just have to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces him in accordance with the string. the list is processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries are appended from the file to the available list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">Here is a value registered, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID supports you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; -numbers you have to leave. if for example & qdbus; the applicationID-ID Copy-3432 has to be displayed, you can only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string code filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diva Filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the strings filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. the words must be limited by partitions (space characters).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; regular, click on the kdeuction.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses a adaptable module architecture for language synthesizers. if you would like to extend it for the use of another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; you need to compile a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages and developer files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you download the source texte of & ktts; downloaded from the source textarchiv for coldecode or have downloaded the program posted each night, then install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; use, check first if speech-dispute with your language synthesizer works properly. to do this, you can use the shell script by the SPD.</seg>

<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at installing & Linux; installed and installed. network devices are later added, the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the files, according to the core version,</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, it is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the appropriate selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release value is best meets. by selecting the setting non-once-inquishment, the definition cannot be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode. before, all options are gray, meaning that settings can only be viewed. in the system administration mode, you will arrive by clicking the button-saving mode at the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distribution (mostly rpm packages), it extends if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphically surface such as kpackage or installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, installation of Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other libraries are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; alterable configurations files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large spread. from IPv6 is expected that it is reflected in the near future. this description is currently focusing on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP-address of a network interface is available. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the contact point available to a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP is not easy to use. in any case, the IP address may not be easily chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mmaske is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same sub-network.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg. .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second-called loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for IP repairing.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The AC address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content can be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2895">& kdat; cult the band back and read the pre-voltage information of the tape. realize & kdat; the preview on the tape not, you will be asked if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preview, is looking for the appropriate index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the bandman shall be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the belt drive changes, to indicate that the band has been incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the belt can now be searched out by out of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the throwing of the bank, first the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; returns with a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-types need to be formatted before you need to be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat; this procedure needs to be done before you are formatted by the band of & kdat; formatted this procedure usually form a formatting of the tape, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the belt. all the data on the belt are lost thereby! after completing the formatting, the band is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the files rushed. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is only saved for this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in the local file tree with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and pick you up in...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, dialogue is open to secure. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "" "" "when you confirm the settings, the dialogue will be secure. dialogue shows the progress of the securing, including the data rate and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it is only checked for selected file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, dialogue settings will be checked for checking. in this dialogue, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "if you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialogue will be examined. this dialogue shows the progress of the inspection process and data offset and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can re-establish the Restore, the files that are to be restored, this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives files, which belong to the entry for the bandage. it will be restored only to the selected file or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. all the marked files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Connecting menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the Restoration process has been started, the dialog settings for restoration. in this dialogue, you can once again check your selection and change the filing folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for restoration, dialogue will be remaking. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data offset and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to reconstruct the bandindexfile using the bandcontent. this operation deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can recreate the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">By this, a backup profile is created with the straight selected files and the default settings. you can make for a backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be taken place. the list of prescribed files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected workfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, applies that only the files currently being stored on the same filesystem, as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystem, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to ascertain which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only those files are saved, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the final incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshots before the call of tar. this causes all files backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are files and lt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-removable version of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmitter & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command will be loaded to the drive. at some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing procedures can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, it is trying to block & kdat; it is not working with all bandages. maybe this setting does not work with all bandages.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when incorporating the integration of & kdat; it automatically shuts the tape. use this option not at Floppy-Streamliner.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option turned on, try & kdat; the hardships support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your band's drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the start of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this character is machine name: seconds, whereas the name of the complete name of the system is formatted on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the time has passed since the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file called "" "" $HOME / .kdat files "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup job. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kshelog; is a & kde; the viewer is suitable for inexperienced users, who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system offers the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kshelog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & kshelog; experienced users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & kshelog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions with whose help the protocol files of certain programs are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 will have & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions available with whose help the individual protocol-lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first of all, the main protocol-file of the system - it will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of its a small news window, so you will not have access to system managers. the protocol files normally find themselves in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually not permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filtering bar in order to filter a string into the filter bar. in the default setting, the selection range will be displayed next to the filter. then a log box contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search function is contained.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. select the string of the filter search record, and then insert in the filtering bar the name of a process, so shows you & kshelog; all protocol lines on which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of level errors are shown with a conspicuous color as a protocol-lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a specific process (e.g. in the system Protocol or in cron protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the issue of a certain command such as the Start of the Samba server. in this case, use filtering bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to pop up new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kshelog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in seperate sub-chamber. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage an additional window. once you have selected a window, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kscarlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archivs: kshelog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops quickly to the standard for the control of the program starts at the high-speed control system in the & Linux; it is because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further in historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binder file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init without reinstallation and new format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc., instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start running the system or when changing to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setters, which will only once start. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually a lot of use for it. you can also create a rc.so in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default-level is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the previous version 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittab from hand and edit the 3. be very careful if you're going through the inittab changes. if you have noticed anything then you will repairing the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you type -l type in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts in hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will stop with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could & eg. a server running level, that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user-level which will & eg., network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to not say trivial: pull one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you prefer to drag them into a new running area. to just copy them from the Edit menu or from the context menu, and even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target area of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you again try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous page.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runtime with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an item manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by eregutes the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to dismiss the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; restored. changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine starts continually new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; to execute under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (LD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way such as system services are started in these distributions, simplified the configuration for the proprietary features of these distributions but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without notice when their configuration files are not present or incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The significance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made modifications, you need to store them. either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or to save the entry in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two mapping cards, user and user list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some mapping cards are only shown when you have advanced system settings. only if you have extended space settings (Quota) for users will be activated on. further mapping cards will appear, if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd will be installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map of Password shall appear, if shadow-passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd can be installed like in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This menu map appears only if available for at least a single filtered filesystem (Quota) and initializing (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can use parameters for each user, whereby the limited restrictions are available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with placeability.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The vacationcard groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, find in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by displaying them in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu or group or click on the right button of the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager to remove the boot password, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change OSes, change, change and more.</seg>
