although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , have danced to American music , American authors have been read and operated by sport .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me , that I was basically a journalist because of an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ters who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who covered his interest incl@@ ined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free from meth@@ ane Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , everything else is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is as welcoming , that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish letter of love about his size .
then , Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about xen@@ ophobia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as it deals with its Eng@@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague of it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women .
nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the Party of nom@@ inate candidates .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ est person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconcile Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met at Phoenix during my time .
like for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world takes up a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s world@@ view was not consistent with the of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours trying to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
still she fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es that always with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those created by them are bodied by my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp began his way to nom@@ inees republi@@ can presidential Presidential candidates , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they were either condemned by racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to overlook this stuff , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as rac@@ ists .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to that situation .
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that these voters are voted for Tru@@ mp for them , because they want to regain control of a country that has been disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who have commented the cruel decision to lift a man who over@@ looks with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. ) WC . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejection of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word@@ play from white in references to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash ( which means much like s@@ ling@@ erie ) , as it called the big Van Jones , has done exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world cher@@ ish the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always welcome , America is definitely welcome .
for this country elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s white promise , saying , to Hell with plur@@ ality , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the ruin , they say .
with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said at the eve of the election .
at a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a word of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. Khan .
the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ connect the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
did A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &apos; NE@@ IN &apos; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan closed with words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God be praised that Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son was like , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura , together ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 miles south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musi@@ kin@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one out of children and adults with their existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras , which with their musical instruments has found an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty .
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and ban@@ den violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope .
the young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group , says the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ go and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically located on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from re @-@ value waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments produced from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycling is started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez in order to transform portions of the instrument into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article on the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place when the parents worked in the trash , the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of apost@@ asy created violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that is called The As@@ sets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance on : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world creates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work successfully fight the illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practicing solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , at that time , that this ship had already been operated in li@@ ven@@ ian waters illegal fishing , before it searched out the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries have brought about accordingly and slightly incl@@ ined to welcome a lo@@ bre@@ cher of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ers , Mos@@ ambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to place one of their ports and refused to give him an fisher@@ y pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries , which you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and followed by the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ age of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protects resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is going to be hidden , is why illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate balance .
but while action against illegal fishing were also ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ dra@@ fting , with the information between individual countries , so these actions are happening in real time , with tr@@ ack@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
here , the individual countries , for example , share lists of existing lic@@ ences , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour check .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of vessels also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite channels .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in bot@@ tom@@ ous areas . also let you discover such suspi@@ cious travel routes - such as those that indicate that a ship has its captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing liz@@ ard where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a Stra@@ fre@@ eb@@ ister .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to remove pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is a significant financial loss for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Leader director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a couns@@ elling company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD from lost sales , which inv@@ ents the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing places that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among its practices , among other things , include the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit Lic@@ en@@ papers , indicating the fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation .
&quot; they take advantage of the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; before , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ling my port not to run &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kom@@ m to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this is precisely this legal slip hole trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations into susp@@ ects ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has been persecuted and found fle@@ eing ships .
based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Food Safety Authority , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can provide information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , proc@@ ure ships more precise locations .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , helps to record the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen are using very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , econom@@ ist at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be executed by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different inform@@ atics each other . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened a platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the marine protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each individual per@@ e@@ ble ship can be shown worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to an investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals , but also terri@@ fy them .
ships that had earlier conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found , found the inspec@@ tors there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars van@@ ished by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; security is the objective to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia that first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was also without a license and were used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen made from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way to protect oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

on Twitter , images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves cover the message about police repression in the central north @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and the armed support of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters are trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry a tube , because there might be something else what many nation@@ alists do not have !
meanwhile , an in@@ graphic is doing the round that forms the scale of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a counter@@ balance process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innumerable people on the streets .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city of CÃ³rdoba .
as now , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
34 years he held the family secrets for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ff . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 , Deputy Commander of Intelligence in the prison of La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sors , which is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who lived over the years the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy , and who stood before a German Tribunal against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent above his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us in the sports hall . there I was friends with a young boy who made combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;re charged with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not abandon you one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionaries People &apos;s army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my Father had brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are being tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - were standing .
everything of that was stolen .
he gave me a little tree wrapped up , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were put down and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on the human being .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body , which was cap@@ tivated straight there .
she rarely provides a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ shot him with water and pursued him a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the rocks there in store was app@@ alling ... as a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , he came the same smell from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , how is it possible for a person to do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tivated and bind the prisoners .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people stood with the face down - everyone was cap@@ tivated by hands and feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; close to the entrance , there remain silent on the mattresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have dreamed , &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there put a man there and killed .
( according to information provided by survivors , the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , served by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , led by the former Fol@@ ter@@ k@@ chambers .
the way you came here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ised .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be displaced .
this was the lie - the eu@@ phem@@ ism - for the promise of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - as they had called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war @-@ mare a bay@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military sign which one assumes an enemy one has fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my Father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to fall into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
once he called me a criminals and I answered , and you that thou hast cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and shou@@ ted :
if you go as far , then will I find you and embrace you .
therefore , we need no one else !
that was my Father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I bore a jacket and a sco@@ ater swe@@ ater . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ e had been at this crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ the bol@@ dness of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act .
now , where I am older , I find Re@@ ue .
I have children . if you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops and realize that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ ek@@ ated during the dictatorship of Man . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children conduct ?
one day my father brought a girl to his house , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people also not have families to whom we were able to pass their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the tigh@@ tening of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were destroyed and killed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains naturally always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made it accus@@ ation because of all the atrocities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ wardly lab@@ eled and asked me what the whole exaggerated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed horrible acts and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uted only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I created the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ tend to me that I have been caught up . I finally have declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 criminal off@@ ences in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death succession in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 year of child .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish to the size of the Court .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the court held in 28 cases lifel@@ ine pro@@ secuted , and in nine cases of adhesi@@ on between 2 and 14 years . in six cases it gave fre@@ is@@ ks .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ parties .
all def@@ endants were members of the military dictatorship of the military , including former military , former police and civilian staff .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the be@@ zz@@ ling chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by un@@ human heads .
the J@@ uris@@ diction is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on fairness for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ founded Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ W.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took place 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed the country on the de la Per@@ la , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible motor@@ cyclists &quot;
the shield with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , in which one can leng@@ then its guide .
the photo was spread in social media .
edited the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its guide , last month witnesses to a very particularly mis@@ fortun@@ at@@ est translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means wron@@ gly , but perhaps also with bad@@ ges &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful motor@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September to display electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
processing of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who pointed out the local time @-@ time .
the Kyoto field Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto News :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( English : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ fecture En@@ apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely apologize that older people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our turn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents , are certainly cause for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 oun@@ ces of Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 Un@@ its .
so your share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents in total dropped , the proportion of the accidents caused by the elderly has risen in the same period .
the named non @-@ named re@@ porter brought comments on the light published in the Yahoo , which show the prejudices of some Japanese apparently against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; How faul@@ ty is the translation actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widely used throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all over Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true fund@@ raising for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for crossing , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills to address it into the target language .
the latter requires an active domination of the target language - something that is the case with mother tongue . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers .
thus , a French mother tongue should translate from English into French , not from French to English .
photo of Flickr @-@ user Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as their native language , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the over@@ setting , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who will learn Japanese .
a number of companies who do not have foreign employees , let translations come to company internally . then , the Japanese employees , whose Engl@@ isch@@ es are considered to be the best , no matter how good or poor his language skills are truly .
photo of Flickr @-@ user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flickr @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations .
Venezuela : to take protests and cens@@ ors on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ z@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , on the 7th April , the Venezu@@ elan internet users had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay on the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet cuts of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will be no longer accessible .
other online broadcast@@ ers contributed to the protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose the Government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests began in the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cured , and recommended the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ elan providers are again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant for 2014 in the coverage of protests . at that time , the Commission had been planned for tele@@ com@@ s with cash and pun@@ ches if they continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission was looking forward to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call for violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ cinem@@ at@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website , which the National Assembly ar@@ gues its meetings .
previous research publications of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will use DNS DNS . it is a technique by which the DNS server requests a certain domains has been solved .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers error or deny the request to the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third clo@@ aked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flores , who took over the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flores was beaten , while he was in a police station .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated Internet connections : this will continue to gain access to multi @-@ media reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls will be slave to obtain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collects witnesses of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas which have been the same as they have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lay cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to dine together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her degree , she went back to the house once more and heard the owner of the house was full of pride about her . she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
the ones from which something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one described more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richest family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that children need to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract which cannot be up@@ lifting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gather testimonies , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , is guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , the daughter of her daughter in believing that she can complete their training , improve their position in society and make something out of himself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that occupies the girl with himself and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not get a training or maybe even star@@ ve .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mist@@ ru@@ sted , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 this has been a relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in the dark in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed tracks of heavy bat . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former military Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the residence .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town located only 3,000 inhabitants 250 km east of the capital As@@ un@@ cion .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed so long with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen company of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go Society for the death of the Girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest , and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the spouses and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a vast study of the fall .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case before judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n can be landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas will not only be exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , Kon@@ course had to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ un@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday , for example , puri@@ fied the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was late , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time also was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to go hungry , but did not get any in@@ definitely food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house@@ keeper as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembered .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the households Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; to read .
he tried to persu@@ ade her to give her faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
he thought she was intelligent , but did not stick to her . &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would get there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i to speak at home once again their native language Guaran@@ i .
their Lord feared that they had the formation they had made to lose , they explained .
but she was absolutely clear that she got for everything she had paid from them , with her hard work .
also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , are bullying and the ra@@ ils who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I was not able to invite anyone to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the insulation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society conf@@ uses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can work advertisements for cleaning personnel and kinder@@ garten in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town in the district of As@@ un@@ cion .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .

in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors ( the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) had to be considered ( an economic system in the Spanish conquest ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( with whom the workers had to be regarded as a

legislation writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian Euro MP have recently agreed to a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terms of use and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is adopted by the Parliament , users need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up in order to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months of adoption of the law , users and users have to register with their proper names and personnel numbers , to make use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it fails to do so , that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ ite .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and cur@@ ated in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defines social media as &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ de , &quot; which is running and used across the internet to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced as it is assumed , as the draft government can impose on how Egyptian authorities should impose the registry . it is also unclear how they are supposed to register those who are unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Spe@@ dition member and Pat@@ rons of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the tel@@ ec@@ om ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Guid@@ elines &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things dealing with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as much as she could control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I take it seriously , then it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also assign it to a judicial process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lature of Parliament and constitutional committees before entering the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating c@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MEP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative framework against cy@@ ber crime , where a lifel@@ ong sentence for those provided to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature reserve protects the Persian leop@@ ards in the war in Iraq

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan in the northeast of the Iraq , H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ government organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub @-@ sub@@ species from the larger family of leop@@ ards , which runs through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey , at risk .
why is this certain type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the eco @-@ system also depends on that a large rob@@ bery is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the wild bo@@ bs@@ led track is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video reveals that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza collap@@ ses in pure joy .
as a educated Bi@@ olog@@ o , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , that exists not only from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and education programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan area .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for the East Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years in order to re@@ construct the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; Trinity disaster &quot; from March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its head office in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a permanent pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the C@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been reached after six years in order to rebuild the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building agency as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( s ) , , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
for the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record 80 percent of the planned spare parts .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is equivalent to 70 percent the final light .
similarly , one is still trying to settle six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by homes ( s ) , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final sub@@ stitutes .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation in 2011 , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency accommodation . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated shel@@ ters were settled in ultimate homes after the disaster .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures .
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of fisheries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y had re @-@ recorded its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have attracted large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again at Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic bomb , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered once again but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only be 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports on the fact that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacu@@ ated groups . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their recei@@ vers had changed across the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article explains the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung :
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o carried out a survey to bring more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that it was still not done enough in disasters prevention .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also raised their attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the tremendous earthqu@@ akes and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , catastrop@@ hic accident , atom@@ izer , the Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 million people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in enduring spare parts .
after the end of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated states still pers@@ isted in temporary shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . they have to compete for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , you can see that there is more connecting than it appears at first glance .
these global connections are important , since they are demanding our prejudices , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa spoke about how the love of music worked in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma , after he collap@@ sed by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstrators participated in a protest movement against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal universal of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions .
doctors performed him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures there is also the face of the police officers , which attacked with a percussion cap . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , there was a military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his headlines on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would test by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive ward , his face would be six months long on TV and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video of Lu@@ iz since Luz recorded video on the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic briefly on it to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence &quot;
the drawing was divided several times into social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed , only to de@@ crimin@@ alize teachers , and here we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked on the intensive ward after he has attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has hit him with a stroke stock .
police intervention
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police forces on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Hi@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police on violence against demonstrators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ esting , by pointing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a bro@@ ther@@ ly glass windows , in order to be arranged with a photo of the cover pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ours a title story with a brand @-@ down bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alism reason to report more about a broken window @-@ disk than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific matter .
this must also be recognized if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd importance , and the typical violence of military police are forced by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ator on the front line with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba from the dec@@ eas@@ ed villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba the doors ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish su@@ ici@@ on@@ mill , no matter what there is no noteworthy sugar @-@ harvesting on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were buried .
after the ground@@ water the sugar industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mor was left of steel and concrete .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some changed the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane is not ro@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are in the east of the region sugar factories that have been in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene is reminded of having heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar @-@ sugar factory would receive , but the promise has not been kept .
the su@@ gars industry have already contradic@@ ted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the poor governance and climate change .
2016 was the production of 1.@@ 6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced in 1910 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago but the bad harvest were no more news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an su@@ gars print ?
the old railway line of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar be@@ hr@@ ates were technically outdated , and barely competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the production of efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose in front of about a decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agri@@ cultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Economic and Food Organisation for the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw material would manage around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then onwards , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the breastfeeding of a total of 98 sugar farms , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar be@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those surve@@ yed are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place will be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first end year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially out of documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could author@@ ise every decision .
from there the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the still@@ birth factory for two years and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still running sugar factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the down@@ grade of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he demonstrated one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace farmers have been exp@@ ired .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work and services which were generated in the churches in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the participants looked , as he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories have not been in operation for five years , everything was going to run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the su@@ gars
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by gau@@ ge .

after two years , the folk parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich discovered that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar @-@ sugar factory closed , or better said than they began to im@@ itate them , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this also disadvantaged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been sub@@ stitutes .
without future perspective , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remain imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty proceeds of the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month , to retirement the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , yet he gives the lies which you told him not .
they have been using it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes over 65 years in cr@@ ente , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter .

youth from the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 Work@@ shop@@ pers launch mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach teenagers , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities , and then together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will allow the young participants to discuss themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance or whatever meaning to them .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the vin@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kite @-@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway the tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen usually indic@@ ative young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the moti@@ f of a video game to convey , how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have been included , the refrain on Cre@@ e is sung .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect in Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands the St@@ rop@@ he in trans@@ cript available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you get our cry out .
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will lift up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead our youth as well .
this is how they can do what they determined to the creators
in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ ins@@ cription ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes in Japan are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic meals ( s ) can be found outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are in the proximity of the entrance being sho@@ cu@@ es san@@ pur@@ u ( s ) , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) offered by every food which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ cking district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that just produce plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic meals are so usual that they no longer find them any more . however , a new trend is turning into a show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media Links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ oters san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic band@@ ed cell bands like they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ ema objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ated magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ oters in refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in Tokyo .
the new boom of the Essen@@ tial settings is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a neu@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell @-@ rail@@ ing box .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile @-@ box .
also this part we prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo &apos;s railway station .
and here is an apple that gives your mobile phone :
designed to be seen as an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the kom@@ ni .
some cell @-@ handed and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen will be used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can play my cell with salmon @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in Plas@@ tics can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone @-@ stands has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and cra@@ y@@ tapes from dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be looked at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag # that can be bought by the &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; s ) .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . such as the sho@@ cu@@ es san@@ pur@@ u for example .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastics dishes actually are produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the Ver@@ mi@@ sts and transmis@@ sions regularly appear only in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a box , thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the dream or the churches which have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each body , behind every bone refund in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never be cure .
that &apos;s why the Mexican news portal is called &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading &quot; ) initiated this sacrifice a voice and tell stories about people working in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug ad@@ versaries and entire communities have to drive a lot of kilometers to make something as easy as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video called &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( deutsch : &quot; how fear lives change &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who has been called secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost only one day their father , their four si@@ blings , their husband and two their ne@@ phe@@ ws .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have placed , go and go to graves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is with me here .
at the moment it has no income .
you are standing on the insurance of my Father , but that does not get them un@@ paid because the one is asking for a death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; declare why the project is so important :
we need not only show the faces of those who are fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the break@@ able and the leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ erin of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central America .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what shape it appears :
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and sensory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come by newspaper For@@ ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones , that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be un@@ valid or consider it normal .
it continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ year c@@ ousin thinks he will be Nar@@ co ( English : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they mo@@ cking those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens .
I see our weakness if stories come to blo@@ gging numbers in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ el@@ essness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ cour@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family with threats have been lo@@ oted . &quot; in it , she describes how armed crime month was ex@@ tor@@ mented for month of money from her business until they had destroyed not only the business , but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
the pain about it never dies , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers as well .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
it included her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will lead or killing you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the generations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells him that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , p@@ tillas , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
however , they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all life of violence and having to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he was just a couple of blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father that was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw it :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ers according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 , the prosecution issued 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ als 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that have organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories are still living in view of new headlines . this project reminds us of those that we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the model journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data launched in 2015 , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs trade , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand unknown words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lift a rum@@ our or fal@@ si@@ fication a fake .
but how is the years after the first time arose ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it was mis@@ leading to protect trage@@ dies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a petrol station crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked off and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people around .
after the civil war , Africa was second biggest country for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous path@@ ways , which were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically this fell to the victim of the petrol trucks .
government officials described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a movie in the proximity , which was full of people who were watching the soccer team .
houses de@@ br@@ ated and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned out to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ability .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example for this .
it shows rows sold @-@ hollow bodies , which are ranked on the ground as people watch them .
but here the story does not find their end .
over the years , the same photo has been applied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , though real , but not associated with related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the dra@@ fted villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse were in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has left to belong to cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images could follow the follow @-@ up time .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ settled , but the army @-@ based in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was mistaken for the fact and potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only a series of mis@@ cre@@ denti@@ als ; Africa Check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases , the image was taken as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
even one step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , the ones who could escape , rape and a few deaths , some through burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which claimed that the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information .
the original contribution towards the last on 26 April 2017 can be accessed here .
other news organizations which AF@@ P had called AF@@ P as their source , had also wron@@ gly bl@@ amed this statement , but had not brought the picture from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false cross @-@ ups will reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information you can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed , private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ ayed wrong reports , others tried to expose the counter@@ fe@@ iting .
we have built examples of the abuse of use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone .
in some cases the countries listed below ( which were linked in some cases ) may have several examples of abuse .
here are some cases that can now be fully played ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point out on pages or servers , are still available via the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ si@@ ders .
the countries in Gray are examples that are available according to metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ aging examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City refers not only to the wrong registration , but also considers the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intentions of individuals and the wick@@ edness of the trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ blica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the town .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ blica quoted as his source of the Spanish news agency E@@ ach ( which is not known whether the original report included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the mass@@ acres of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , as this here , who is used to illustrate the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atrocities &quot; of Islam , have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster ren@@ amed the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then carried by a post of US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic commentary of Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from DR Congo has been seen as a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an abuse of the image from the DR Congo , with one twe@@ et , expressed sympathy over the Nig@@ erian mass and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , as yet the photos of it were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar &apos; government released a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ oned news and photographs of what it came as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ oned News and Photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this cur@@ ative position , which appeared exclusively in English also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of sc@@ aff@@ olds who run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims are Buddh@@ ists kill and their way ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this mail , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the picture of DR Congo is NO to Muslims , killing Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have been denied that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the picture from San@@ ge together .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over students , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the Kath@@ oli@@ an near the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; hadi@@ st attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist the newspaper El Pa@@ is that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Å@@ czyk y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of DR Congo emerged , equipped with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and rede@@ emed a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were doing these events , the mut@@ u@@ ously under the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acres of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ary ) . but the messages that were linked with it were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , &quot; by the Nig@@ erian massacre , translated it on discussion boards such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the wrong message .
from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are more confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sides in the following countries ( in the cap in grey ) , ink also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps ) exist on the web@@ tin and isolated , they feature image file related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original left @-@ out of 2010 , the image will ultimately result in a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( single beam ) , which drag these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used regarding greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is important to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth examining how images in connection with these efforts are being used .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give a longer belief in these images .
with social media there are tens of people who have contributed to un@@ inten@@ tional share of the water around a tragedy .

the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that with@@ holding images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . at times these images are even required by the victims .
at the same time , worry is that violent images can des@@ ensi@@ tise people and spectators and feel the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 License .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ored to provide language enthusiastic to offer a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or at all to translate .
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or emotions that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all contradic@@ ts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or phrase is sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is needed to accurately understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected already for a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find example words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - sample yourself to receive your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having awakened in the sun at cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they compens@@ ate other cultures , revealing other poetry and ar@@ ouses our curiosity .
sometimes you will see how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; who are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite sw@@ ings here .

how Sri Lanka re@@ tin@@ ts the worst catastrop@@ hic disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst flood of water and lands@@ lips over this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually works in late May , are pushed for the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and sl@@ amm@@ ers .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe dur@@ ations .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas were slowly returned .
health and hygiene standards represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kas le@@ thal floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was located in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded with G@@ alle also flooded due to the water@@ way of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has five planes available for rescue operations and another five will be made ready for transpor@@ ting emergency supplies for the residents in their flooded inhabitants .
also different organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help F@@ lood Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka do not provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue ships will need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .

the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ ainen centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ ick Ro@@ an@@ u , pic@@ tured a &quot; High water@@ aid &quot; button which allowed it to call users allowed a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the s@@ ri@@ kan R@@ ote cross .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need for safety and help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further life , whereby the Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now on the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
usage : Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and loving girlfriend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the surge .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next scale , we use rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and humans , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ic picture of a woman having a head , bound up from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they con@@ fession me .
there are 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like I will not fit in each other .
Molda@@ vian are to be de@@ ported
I am not working alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
which images do they come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in Western thought the religion of Rum@@ is was removed , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this dele@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced pictures of Muslims , the Western books have been coloni@@ ze for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man that one should be afraid and the exotic woman that one should save .
the Norwegian Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was breaking down the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to emerge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ letters .
this Nar@@ rati@@ o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows the reality that in the last three decades of nine Muslim women led their countries while the U.S. could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ cloth in public buildings and su@@ ck @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong scar weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were discussed at the American land of Afri@@ cans , which were brought about with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children will become the aim of anti @-@ militar@@ istic attacks and vic@@ timi@@ zation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; due to these stories we tell and on account of the way we are telling it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion belonging to 1.@@ 7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to grasp the rati@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to see where there are seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African American people .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first gem design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan drew up the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now inevitable Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes , if people ask me why I am not a por@@ k , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ some pocket , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not wear all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight far @-@ spread lies of Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing bond produced by a well presented Islamic enemy machine with finan@@ ci@@ ers , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information that is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories we tell and on account of the way we tell them , &quot; Islam@@ ophobia exists in more than just a stranger , who carries out a woman the head towel .
or as the scary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms acc@@ esses our adher@@ ence to .
it attacks our identity that is so wide , so versatile and diverse that it impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as a mus@@ li@@ a but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when soci@@ o@@ ists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and adher@@ ence .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbor in the Bran@@ ch , see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 metre concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter , if I bore them into my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of the protection that defeat the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
each of them repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , evil , which you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author when she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
adher@@ ence is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters , as she win a contest of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close to this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her full @-@ finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that they can virtually maneu@@ ver@@ able .
Mus@@ lim@@ a must be to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - above centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; which has established a company with the name Ven@@ erable British East ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God to my only master .

middle of the bridge , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan , killed his family in India &apos;s dominated Kash@@ mir , family that he could not close his arms in half a century .
adher@@ ence to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose family , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world like at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coloni@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected a century ago above a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , a Swedish , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ ordinate of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he conducted the first mosque in England .
even before the aircraft existed , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion to belong deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our irre@@ voc@@ ed story .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops who were spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , have been distributed in Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the su@@ icide of the Veter@@ ans has risen more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy the US holds back and the susp@@ ects have a Muslim name , the story of four times is reported as a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that four thousand years ago the first prayer call , the az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African , Islamic Emirate called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed as people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ band , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fied the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to further communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother to care for my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged to build structural Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim registr@@ atures , who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of transi@@ ent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration office that takes up a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the Visi@@ er .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw at Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically accurate picture and have them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims got the sligh@@ test point .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ ing to see the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints that we engage in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently overlooked identities and forget history .
the Pod@@ cast lake there , S@@ ay something of Bu@@ zz@@ ay ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ isch , mus@@ li@@ ically , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we find ourselves .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is a reason that the conspir@@ atorial theore@@ ti@@ cians , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now guide the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago she had not yet given her ; now they are dominating big areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me a must @-@ found Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ der track in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , for in all the interaction that constitutes our humanity , may become a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why would I tell you this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people mis@@ directed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , four decades ago himself of scientists of Stan@@ ford .
we need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to for@@ tify &quot; other &quot; in the course of the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , as he has already broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller tell , from Flickr @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the telling of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ en@@ force@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . this is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been held for 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children who born there .
for the creators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns , the diversity - secure rooms where residents do not need to forget who they are to be counted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often with it often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for purposes of these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list@@ ens to estimate , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their presentation will result in getting the audience on it .
they call laughter and emotions that language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou have also taken the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of the narr@@ atives .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the h@@ asen and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico also calls for the United States Neu@@ de@@ isation of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , participated in the last 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations involved in a mass rally ; the march started on the pu@@ er@@ t@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was founded by group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da . &quot; ( Citizens &apos;s Front for the Neur@@ examination of debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church assembly in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advocates of re@@ defining the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os invites politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts for their corrupt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a committee committee without personal interests at public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuner@@ ation that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will pres@@ pres@@ et and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not yours .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining wages .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the State @-@ area in the territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party membership with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing governance .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside the measures are imposed , without the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration contributed the name &quot; Cl@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is ming@@ led for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has provided for an open network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is organised in Berlin devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ que campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , manager of book spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; made books within three to five days , las@@ es excer@@ pts from the book of cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that was published last year and is available lic@@ enced here , contains a number of elev@@ ations which deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book I want to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ letters and to create something from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers , which has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the A@@ dra prison directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on his present state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and immediately .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have to start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we now here ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise convic@@ tions ?
the web developers for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention for Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an un@@ known place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; marked by the Military Court from his cells in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death part against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a vital role in promoting access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bash@@ an , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes pres@@ cient as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra virtually .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the pioneer of numerous civilizations and here are mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which is not only em@@ bodied the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically this project has not yet been closed until now .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I &apos;ve spent my entire life with it , of freedom to dream and ba@@ za@@ ar taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English in , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with each he asked . he has taught other incar@@ cer@@ ers to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other incar@@ cer@@ ties as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ vocation , which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
they put the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic .
the book is available as license @-@ free .
book envelope by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is devoted to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is done &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is happening on every visit ,
that I have lost in the world of your gorgeous eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace
that each of the dangers are not care ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the thrust of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
that I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes must say Good@@ bye
and I leave a further piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my sol@@ itude ,
to return all of the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I myself persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year flies , my soul
while
I in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or imposed under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
today , we repeat our call in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption exp@@ ur@@ ing director after dis@@ miss@@ al of dis@@ miss@@ al to pre@@ exp@@ ire post
Mos@@ ambique acted with anger to a corrupt fall in which a government member returned after half his sentence in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za that was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants in 2010 ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money was from public transit of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was presented by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his return to the company , which happened on 19 April then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the pro@@ secutor of the Republic , which em@@ bodied the request , there would be no obstacles for Cam@@ ba@@ za to get back his old post , as the company had no discipl@@ ining process according to his detention facility .
however , many people do not accept the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with the German wave , condemned the decision of the company to put the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a back @-@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and even a backward step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have led to a lack of discipl@@ in@@ ations against the resistance .
the company seems obvious , however , and prompted no proper legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , this behaviour also re@@ jects and considers the case as &quot; reluct@@ ant . &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be counsel@@ or after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half of them were drow@@ ned .
he could hold speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and record his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
resist !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , Young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director possessed no morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him I cannot believe someone was rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massive ins@@ ul@@ ted .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the State , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only served itself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ ler it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired who was up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique will not only remain in mind for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ uting and - by far - prophe@@ tic redund@@ ant .
one of his most famous oral acts was , when he energ@@ ise that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that that is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not withdraw from his ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious person is a criminal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criminal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and came free .
and today it sets out the company , in which he exp@@ ires funds , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ atology ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ se or ar@@ aged .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well known Social Network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or in general use as an ad@@ jective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical national @-@ nationalist movements gave the word an extremely de@@ fle@@ dged con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word in itself does not automatically call hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his usage have been expressed .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with underlying different meanings , which have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair will be written to Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( camel ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ier @-@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post office of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether she knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by making a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ gment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that she would decrease hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but she also stressed that Facebook could be analy@@ tic before it all po@@ sts that dissemin@@ ate in suspicion , racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm does not understand what you write on faces .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these dre@@ ck@@ ery nation@@ alists , to spread the hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to be circumc@@ ised by nationalism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all , dissemin@@ ate the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of perc@@ ussions is often a cat@@ cher and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the writer A@@ ung Ka@@ at described , such as Facebook began to delete his post@@ ings , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and sent to me the light , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the Post of the Facebook Community standards did not mention . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has a variety of posts removed from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions on hate crimes against more radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his thoughts about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more words to cens@@ or will only bring more hatred within the various communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems to have started this without local context or technical support and so as words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ y curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even as they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the frau@@ dul@@ ent posts .
if they had just a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would result in a great deal of sales , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of co@@ ats under users .
rather than taking it seriously , users now make themselves funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that have no hate speech , but still removed :
with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look for pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to try out if Facebook removes the post office that contains the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot which uses permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot which uses permission .
over the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have also used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally raise public violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands of escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to talk and critic@@ ised the young hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply being cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better on context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the h@@ ehe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously by a law adopted by the Parliament to ban this practice so that it is now under 18 .
before this change in the law a number of members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities participated in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country said that the state cannot interfere with , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; defined for every human being under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.@@ 8 percent , and 18 percent were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the Federal Chancell@@ ery was confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to create laws at home @-@ marriage , followed at the foot and pleasing much support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this result .
nonetheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no concern to say the critics of the children of children , they ought to be condemned again to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition worked for tension in this actually in@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts on whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must approve and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the stations of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which was posted by Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill draft against the children &apos;s before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for and no one against it .
after being decided prior to the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media user was enthusiastic because the laws of the children &apos;s before were finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who held a ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed at the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status @-@ Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news !
the adul@@ thood has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ INA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
now , the delicate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious belief 18 years .
the draft version of the spouses Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who have opposed to the law have been voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ehe is by law no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing club .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dharma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the Adv@@ oc@@ ate Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it is quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would act against the law , most social media users , however , would address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in general , in a way we would say , rather talk of the problem , that the state , our daughters , protects them that they are likely to be mis@@ chie@@ vous madness , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places around the world where the children of children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they are underestimated .

through the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now blocked Turkey the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on the Encyclo@@ pedia .
day by day will be more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information and to share .
both students and journalists and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against blocking .
although many techniques I used are used to use byp@@ ass tools for block websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article by the New York Times report that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been reading article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , finding regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the first @-@ known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ rors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform deduc@@ ed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine connections ) which does not base on the system of domain names and making a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition however .
in a Blog@@ post , IP@@ FS has reported about his efforts :
since we have heard the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to place Sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least look at all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also indicated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page from Wikipedia , as well as Wi@@ ki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to hollow similar mir@@ rors when in the respective country Wikipedia , is brought forth .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one att@@ aches to a different URL that is not the original one . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was at and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as bad as they look .
and he should know it because he was already standing by faces to face :
a tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home , because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the be@@ he@@ avi@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ eth me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked on environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and often lived in a tent in order to make up the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , who live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

this paper was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az and an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women can avoid the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should be the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a shame and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names .
the tradition of their wives also do not name their wives , is also dissemin@@ ated among men . however , they have much less be@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not come out of this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , were nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and became quickly became the main round of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the reduction of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as child healing , to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected tics , and manages these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and they have also made it the amb@@ ass@@ adors of change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her panel of discussion showed that their hus@@ bands did not name their hus@@ bands &apos; name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy of a problem with which women can easily identify with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking the name of their hus@@ bands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bread , whom they have fully contracted and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition indicates that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stick to it is regarded as a h@@ isti@@ fied , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never thought of up to that discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never known her husband until now , at home try out how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh still long after the video was finished .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion s@@ lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , most of all girls and women were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video , the women tried to get the discussion with a exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ aks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she ki@@ cked her throughout the exercise only , a different decided to let the whole circul@@ ate frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ renalin rush about it , with an old bracel@@ et broken , the women decided that they would actually try their hus@@ bands to name their hus@@ bands .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put into his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club @-@ member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she war@@ med her , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cru@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of an attendance was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ra@@ ined in force .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ized red spot on the forehead , which shows the marriage :
why do women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the petrol @-@ red spot if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed , and I listened with it to wear it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but they think they are now in a better position to vote themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion s@@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on a trip with every issue of Dis@@ cussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought beforehand .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identities on our hus@@ bands , never talked so honestly .
it feels great to say certain things according to it , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion panel , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is for their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ty spa , a vast shirt of a pants , wear ; they did not have to drink .
after much arguments and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mug@@ gled Roh@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ tas ( upper inhi@@ bits ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could carry them .
next they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion s@@ lu@@ b have changed a bit , the Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but listening back then again to tell the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it even , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands : one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ asti@@ ff of more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am there too .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman gets home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beatles in its landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on the 29th of June this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was able to find the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World mem@@ or@@ acle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese Twitter trend in which many fans have inter@@ changeable memories and their appreciation for the Beatles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is known as a turn@@ around in Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ elia , who was interviewed by the Beatles in 1964 in London , marked 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles also were in the country , but this has passed to let the Japanese over@@ turn .
the people here become quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms .
many well known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles arrived in Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cul@@ t band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ ki Asian Review .
good morning ! today , the Beatles &apos;s memorial day in Japan . the number of 51 years ago were in Tokyo .
also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English @-@ learning Spanish classes .
the Beatles also survi@@ ves everything .
today is The Beatles &apos;s memorial .
we all love in our house The Beatles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should represent John Lenn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also made pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you love the Beatles , those are your 5 places you necessarily need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( V@@ om Link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be sk@@ it@@ ri@@ le enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beatles &apos;s memorial .
this was the first time in 1966 last year in 1966 .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! take a pilgrimage to London and walked above Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course , some companies benefit from the fans of the fans , such as this r@@ ams @-@ shop ( names are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .

a new system of kidn@@ apped persons for organizing trading , presumably for aber@@ g purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ly , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs have been removed .
two men were arrested and in a row they stood , that the organs of sham@@ ans are exploited in Tanzania and Malawi .
I give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a sli@@ ps of gold could bring gold or wealth explained the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ ass@@ ment men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the purpose of murder for ob@@ scure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission in order to investigate the Prak@@ tik .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are traveling to Mozambique , are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambique police after the latest assass@@ ination of three gl@@ adi@@ ated men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ ination were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the sli@@ ps men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of glass individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sham@@ ans into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims would have in mind , the riches generation .
in recent days , three men were murdered with hair removal problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique faces :
I would like to say E@@ IN Mozambique , which would have been ashamed of a country where people would have ashamed about good notes , work and other achievements , a nation where people would not hurt or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or sli@@ ps for ab@@ err@@ atic purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to reach plenty of wealth .
despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some have not to be missed the opportunity for flaw@@ less humour .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably was recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the de@@ tained Chinese dissi@@ dents of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June , having been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion . &quot; after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China was involved .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , and a spokes@@ man told him to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , permit or give it a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully excav@@ ated .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ da have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government was in fact nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ record the salmon to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after reading the message that Li@@ u was seriously fallen ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick its price in Oslo .
due to its detention , he was unable to grant his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house of house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as it was in an explanation on 30 June 2001 :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us spouse and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , so that he may help him with his recovery . &quot;
a speaker in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message received the Chinese authorities not only fre@@ eing li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US message drew a devast@@ ation response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to make an un@@ reasonable and ir@@ responsible comment on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the following couple :
protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and judicial system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also have a decision introduced to the Congress to push the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally release .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he may go to a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needed , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources taught in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owing to the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um prompted China to provide adequate medical care and give it the possibility to worry about his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um tells about :
Canada calls for China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , freedom and rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June to free Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments that he , regardless of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news transm@@ itter France Info has already reported that the French government called Li@@ u in the country was well known , the State Department gave out that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ land@@ matters in Taiwan called on June 27 on June 27th , release on Li@@ u and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator People Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party Party also urged China to permit the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was severely punished , led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and wealthy , which in turn has contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is on an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam should Singapore be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , one he@@ ars that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities , an infringement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , Wh@@ ose Country is it then ?
the reasons that were led by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one can &apos;t measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what it appeared im@@ it@@ less un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the issue , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian mach@@ inations , who pre@@ tend to be the tw@@ isted logic , since it fits better to their power .
during the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam the answers to his American guests were given regarding our press , our ju@@ dik@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions lay him with non @-@ answers to rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to illustrate his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so in which country our city belongs to ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thankful when our little K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clear this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by posting on the blog of his comment , he points out about critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , so that the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam could better understand , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the Mit@@ ter@@ book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he spent Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore was not a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously has not meant it in that sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , which makes a leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore had said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ comp@@ lies the weaknesses of Shan@@ mug@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ belief a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian de@@ speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role inside the cabinet , the statements made by Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the pollut@@ ants afford their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay the bills ?
what is the value of our pink human resources ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade for the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung of Singapore , the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade , Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot;
this proposition does not seem to have anno@@ yed many leaders ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your homeland or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is asked me most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions .
in my view then most often the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ wardly in anger , when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me that .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differ from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian Flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and 11 September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried out small ap@@ hor@@ n@@ ets to their luggage to differ from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
we also say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
it would mean to me nothing if you would change from Dallas for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first , as &quot; nice &quot; to be described , basically to be mirror @-@ like - as well as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic iron@@ ically insignificant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Double ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem lies in that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can encounter .
be harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to make a walk around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main piece of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have now connecting with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister has made Canada quite sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video that took the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des which took power in 2014 and restore the civil government despite their promise , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them what rules him his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days that was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called up the public to look at this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these shots of the video , which relate to some of the policy issues that Thailand has been pursuing over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the provisional constitution , with the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , and is granted absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ ambiguous provisions are often used by the authorities in order to ad@@ minister activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army , supervised online content and people who fores@@ had@@ owed , the monarchy is sl@@ ander@@ ed to have pro@@ secuted .
Thailand is a stri@@ pe set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ins@@ ul@@ ting ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was founded in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems that continued to pursue the Jun@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ marine boats , although safety experts warned they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax wear .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black supply van before putting them into a dormit@@ ory storage , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in jail , because it supposedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users will be threatening for a long time , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs members of the band , called the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , who was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ian War was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ th@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the coal pool of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , for the most part Russian and ag@@ gra@@ zing live in the area .
these settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ ties in Ab@@ ch@@ sia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has risen in 16@@ ,000 people after over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ amar@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were church centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , which served all of the community .
now , there is only paved road with ban@@ ished splend@@ or buildings .
the people that once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ os@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girlfriend somewhat and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ k@@ ish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the District administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jun@@ k k@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Cape Asia to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ aba , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ alya tells us that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and to celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational speaker Nat@@ asch@@ a lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds himself of the village of life in front of the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ sia broke away ) , they had not the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we have recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ alisation town in Ab@@ ch@@ sia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will still be a little longer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives about $ 9 for every child .
your husband works in the cohesion .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha was once again , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that there was a very scary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
actually , it has to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation tends to the end , a little boy went over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him .
he plays with the ball , which then desc@@ ends the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones at the exp@@ ir@@ able buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for imbalance in their lives .
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Wall@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org .
on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old palace , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink glasses and gold @-@ coloured ear @-@ rings in te@@ ddy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Wall@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this pointed name is to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Haiti that are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with p@@ ale , ab@@ stain@@ ed walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come to full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also have already slept on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they are mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ ms that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama was a reasonable nickname for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ o@@ che ) posi@@ zes with Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard of other guides from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel the circuit and that Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building agent on builders of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest for M@@ om Africa for months now . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reply he smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that her guests will often send her messages to text messages , if they have gone , to gr@@ ind them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith was the driver of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only fun@@ ken of hope for the migrants who travel through Wall@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s of Valencia .
this winter we have added to Valencia and his family migrants in their little house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are going through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his job site from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Wall@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to take the money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ e he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , single @-@ known , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers consult their phones .
a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy to have her house full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she is about her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African mou@@ ths who has done her a lot , some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more , boy and Old .
they laugh as they briefly present them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang People are forced to install a surveillance app on its phones .
one check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to the so @-@ called &quot; s .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10th , the Handy @-@ User at Tian@@ shan District of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi got a cell aler@@ ts in which she points the district government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said to get access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app just after they had replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the Communication , the App was able to determine the sources and distribution routes to the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , of online sc@@ ams , tro@@ users and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers allow to manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ aling from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
while reports of digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , depres@@ sive ethnic minorities , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .

sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ outs after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane illustrates his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you are looking forward to and you realize that you are all alone at a place where everything is important .
everything changed after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both inside and outside .
one who makes her name all glory .
one who has de@@ pressed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get back the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and performers - the characters into beings have become of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outs after death .
all doubts resolve itself in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ l . you realize that you are trapped between the walls , which your parents , and in front of them have built your grandparents , stone to stone .
they have arrested myself and my father three times , but this was not enough , so that I learned &quot; my lesson , &quot; how the boss of the security service was form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he testi@@ fied His power over us , by even destroying the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were swe@@ pt up during a peaceful protest like wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbour@@ hoods sought , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is stretched to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down something after the power supply was stopped in the quarters .
I broke the still@@ ness by asking several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house from crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ tory by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt courageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent image , filled with my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free to use the spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t care in the t@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on board .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low . nothing can give your voice back after you have put them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st ghetto was standing there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st ghetto begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry out if we are not close by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ull @-@ filled eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to see me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so certain to me when I answered , &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes him equal to him and his father to the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ ated proposition is until today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I shou@@ ted the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I need with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the single cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I care the room .
otherwise , they probably shared a bigger cell for me this time .
I must share it with just one other prisoner and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I pushed back to an old @-@ proven communication method : to hit the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ vision was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he answered me ultimately .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was none of the surrounding cells that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness can be seen in me not a distinctive facial traits , and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers is one of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would love him if I stay .
li@@ ar .
like that , I would have had a scar@@ ring to exp@@ el all these cro@@ wing , which was on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at these times the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that introduced us to the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &apos; Don@@ ner , &quot; announ@@ cing on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be mis@@ heard . &quot;
this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , speaking it in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they also played their con@@ fes@@ sions of their world views .
this is not a house , which is here not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I support the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet with Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to log out this day and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do not answer .
I used to reply to myself not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really cannot say exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become an ordinary communication for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to me or to get used to be punished , although I had not done anything to make this punishment .
on penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which is probably derived from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ u@@ ker takes care of your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry fell to him not enough , which is why they ex@@ changeable the pipe by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as garbage dump , or if that belonged to the normal labour equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , in order to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a giant cab@@ al .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ u@@ tion@@ er noticed the cooling , and found no favour at all , which is why he went up next to an electri@@ cally invited rod .
flow through my entire body , enough to store my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ baked body , which lay out on the ground was the perfect power leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been so at midnight .
I decided to lay down my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours went that followed me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning opens the space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to make a terrible worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and walk you , you will move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jama@@ anic R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am h@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ ts to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips .
he lives on the top of his family house , which since 1967 belongs to them ; the year in which Israel had forced its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of the Palestinian Arab world . all these issues are found not only in his hometown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and according to his own statement , he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though it is not open , it hur@@ ts a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination to the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he describes himself , even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I am saying , &quot; I am a human being , &quot; while he poured into waters in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli law also states that public consumption of food is illegal while Ramad@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot jun@@ it@@ ag had little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the s@@ laugh@@ tering makes warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the k@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is inevitable to do some fundamental things - like drinking in the public during Ramad@@ an Water - to land not in jail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens brought a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians , who support the Islamic State of Action - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual Fron@@ tal Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
the members and former press spokes@@ woman in the Islamic Coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also assert that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that provides the alt@@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la said the Jama@@ ican people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continue to use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply sil@@ ken rhet@@ oric , but actually become a clear and clear reality reflected in Jordan , which appear in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional gender standards are glu@@ ing by having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have endu@@ red sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lower @-@ known woman whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the number of Hon@@ orary infrastructure reached its peak ; however , in addition , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried victims of murder , or domestic violence in appropriate ways .
according to a law to fight against terrorism from 1954 , women can be suspended in a detention centre , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , not to shy away from issues that are in his country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he is able to separate his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and speech .
&quot; I come from the Near East , Mann .
I was accused of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically politically neg@@ atively led .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; which one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homo@@ sexuality .
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still very cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular online Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments from the context were swe@@ pt up and his opinion were cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance is not talking to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , which remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks , if Abu Nu@@ what was to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century was open to homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive votes are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jama@@ ican news service adopted several former government boards and members of the curriculum , with the reason they had expressed critical on the problems posted in social media with the problems that were deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs just say the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has dri@@ lled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it seems like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , op@@ pressive and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an Society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs , also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreams not only of it , his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature is closer to genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , struggle uni@@ forms and in artificial kind . at least he hopes that .
until then , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one thought it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory implies that the for@@ ks , the dru@@ mm@@ ers and dancing over more than one thousand years , and from a time date , in the armies from the west Japan mar@@ ched in the northeast in order to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to take a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two hard cars are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rau@@ b and illi@@ cit drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to make themselves more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers , Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create from them the most beautiful L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to find young people to find out their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice to find a training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ dder opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March prior to March , reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because from love to children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love notes at guer@@ rilla
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the post &quot; love message of guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this entry will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love notes to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel tired , affection ?
just this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspir@@ es them to the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people res@@ sing letters to write guer@@ ri@@ descent letters .
just recently , her country was a place of historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colom@@ bian ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the sig@@ nat@@ al of the peace contract as such that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
there is still a long way ahead of Columbus before you can talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla warri@@ ors who have been faced for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into the life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had accustomed themselves to life in fear and in some cases deep hatred towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ rilla war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; must now take up their ranks and support it when building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian Colom@@ bians would have to help and in the integration process would have to help .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla struggles to welcome them back in the company .
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ illa , which should be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi in 2014 .
this explained that we love the man we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love notes , but those forget that they need much more necessary .
he plan , he told , he continued to share his love with people this year .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is present in all major towns of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and BogotÃ¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought any one would forgive
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bogot@@ a in the camp to transfer letters personally .
the members of F@@ ARC presented themselves as they did earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of shelter from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the Policy scientist Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the Govern@@ ors of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ rilla warri@@ or live ) , I saw an guer@@ rilla shock , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that is why I answer it . &quot; then the tears ran through the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him in firm and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ches .
perhaps he was tired of war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there which is waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a panel discussion .
the students had grown up all grew up as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC made the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the whole Colom@@ bian people have acted . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in that country more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no electoral law , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were turned around , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament of peace would prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to protest to weapons and protest for their rights . and this is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we from the F@@ ARC now bet on peace , to a policy without weapons .
therefore we call upon all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring the sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article that has been written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and whose initial publication on the OC Media website took place .
homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months regarding persecution of pregnant men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ Q community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has not only emerged overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who had shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered international headlines from several months after reports have been published , that the disp@@ osi@@ ties , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic discussed .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chn@@ yan authorities , the suspi@@ cious men of fes@@ tivities and they were in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun barrels .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since their childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was born , her became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chn@@ were experienced by the genital equ@@ als of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
because of fear for their life they moved to the USA in the end .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day someone was told me that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ it@@ tering that put into difficulties .
she had no money , so I took her without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , someone was thinking of what I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ asti@@ ty friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya , who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents were made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bag from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ ored the family , do you stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently some women got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ points in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary p@@ oul@@ try .
OC Media : in which medical wings are you placed - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , because my male name is still ; but the doctor understood and set me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ a , a cau@@ dal name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
in the last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , some totally unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the demanded to send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya in order to prove that this was all a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me I must prove it by going up without the streets of the street ; others wanted me to tre@@ ach on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have gran@@ ular size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once spoke my mother on the streets .
you said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed your family , but the whole of the Republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbors and saved them .
during the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark window windows and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 dr@@ one .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something lazy .
my human right @-@ righteous friends handed over the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I quit the country , but then something happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them , without register without letting me , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them in the trash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you are st@@ agn@@ ant . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about the gender equality but this is a tab@@ lo@@ topic .
some traditionally cau@@ dal elements are still wearing in me .
as much as I wish , these psych@@ ic barrier can I do not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person she reminds himself of her past - that is , in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are dor@@ sal ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has been fed in Ar@@ gun and a half months .
he told that during Ramad@@ an , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t shut out a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
in order for me , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ ging .
OC Media : are now still sw@@ aying men in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives , or who were dropped by their relatives in order to put Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
so far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically under@@ went to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is it just a messenger , or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun at a half and a half months .
he says that lots of people in this prison have disappeared after their beard was grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there are still no reports until now . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise you could not have these people to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people that belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always contributed my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , even before 2003 , I was already in whole Great Britain , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally wanted to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately brought us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored lashes , carried tube je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security Ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never used me only one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me like me .
it was a small place where several benches was standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a waste of phrases : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ice is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children when who make themselves fun about sick .
OC Media : so just have her eyes closed before you , because they believed you were ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this gn@@ aw@@ aken work ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk on television about morality .
he did not talk about us , but foremost about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change .
he who sm@@ iles and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic was constantly worse .
OC Media : what activity are you going to work now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I am not doing much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
otherwise , I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for fifteen Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , gathering information , I beg@@ ged them to the hospital and help them to get food Post@@ cards .
I do not have a p@@ enny for it for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves as I cl@@ ad to refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : take a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is silly .
in this way , nature , it has nothing to do with religion at all .
that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to proph@@ esy you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no gay men .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ als have , who , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and fast during Ramad@@ an - live with men .
do you know many thinking about Transi@@ tional in men who love men , and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ utter .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life @-@ settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be here personally , but my final intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it quick to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide which happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and campa@@ ig@@ ners warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights was that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have to be based .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt helpl@@ ess and un@@ able due to persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in the majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to ride their living .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i @-@ monarchy took over power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ a@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most demanding and most valuable areas of agriculture for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is developing slowly , and the local population gets only little from that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs , systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , built the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have only resulted in destroying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youth now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Minister of Co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , applied that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed the elementary school , ended 55 % a secondary school and have 45 % university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; said to a &quot; hei@@ gh@@ tened rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse recently . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , newly emerging ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
as function@@ aries and institutions preferred not set up Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the access to jobs in all sectors is de@@ ported .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their living outside their home ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i as even the Arabic name at the workplace can not be tolerated , because speaking the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances , who have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , propose human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional struggle &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide zur and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even set well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth covering , and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and i will be double and triple , including .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS community , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from Diaspora , if I mention , on which kind we have been physically , psych@@ ologically and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , not to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but nevertheless all women agree that women - all women - come together to up@@ lift their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it that there are in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and proven@@ ance earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are subjected to a higher risk with a migration background to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all human beings , neither skin colour , have the same rights ; on the other hand I can not join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , which refuse to take into account the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and won &apos;t fight my membership in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner stood in 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which black woman is a human and margin@@ alised nature in historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join forces which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to be silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different arri@@ vals and borders itself from the White Femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and re@@ fr@@ aming the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather stub@@ born to me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that Inter@@ se@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define our own ideas according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that will be created for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , author of the book Afri@@ cana may well : as we can defend ourselves ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) that we can defend ourselves by establishing ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are totally secure and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and on the basis of my being as a part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither betrayed , nor ignored .
p@@ ad@@ del@@ ve against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this paper by Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental issues .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern by Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of water bodies , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ government organisation Water@@ keeper Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - that is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work together : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ makers and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published .
the focus of her work lies on watched , little observed sub @-@ cultures and is characterized by using cognitive vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help oppressed municipalities to tell their stories their way .

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas @-@ consuming ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the persons involved .
a police Com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partners , who had become violent in opposition to violence .
since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , useful also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second woman drew her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women do not even report , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who mist@@ re@@ ate them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general at all in law enforcement authorities .
content 1 beats and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible shortcomings and a legal system that nothing under@@ t@@ mm@@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation of bats and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are genuinely mixed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for genom@@ ics at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different indications and reports that do not even accum@@ ulate the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads , because of domestic violence . at 70 % of them it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace process . here , 86 % of the ads came here .
in the ads said 40 % of women that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic women &apos;s Minister in Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of those criminal off@@ ences are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman , who are re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , coming 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to any woman who is re@@ funded because of physical abuse , come two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they explained the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s su@@ icide is not an own criminal off@@ ences , law enforcement agencies can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the co @-@ ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on the basis of violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that does not sub@@ ordinate anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then there was still . this should not regret it forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but two years she carried the psych@@ ical violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women have happened to be inf@@ erior , because they are decei@@ ved by violent males .
I was convinced that it would never happen .
Mari@@ ana use social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name to mention , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long in Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some co @-@ blame for it .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not derived from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is mist@@ re@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimonies of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
your wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as advertisements on the authorities without a result and also by their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an im@@ penetr@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the adver@@ t of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Re@@ qui@@ eter ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a stand@@ alone criminal off@@ ences and to pun@@ ish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law that they feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are paved , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment .
the original legis@@ lature had planned , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which have to present the victims of violence by themselves , if they simply want to refund and provide a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lature had no sufficient financial resources available to it :
in Paraguay acts as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
a re@@ consideration must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who rep@@ lied in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the cul@@ pr@@ its of the offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund as long as they are no more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . however , among other things , a passage was painted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dele@@ tion of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law applies as a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun@@ ni@@ tion of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the home page of the published newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he held an old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Num@@ er@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but came back again later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of the sult@@ ans is identified by the persistent effort of security forces , in particular by domestic security , including press freedom , limiting media freedom , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and dis@@ credit other activists .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n paper , their closure and imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced after the newspaper had appeared in the judiciary on 26 July 2016 . in it , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court to Oman under pressure , to raise a sentence in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edition of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Num@@ er@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board Committee , was invited to the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the Deputy Chief Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who has worked as a chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed at an un@@ determined time after the Minister of Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison pris@@ ons and orda@@ ined the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ dig@@ ging of the state &quot; state .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison organ and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year career was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a penalty of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after having the use of &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronoun@@ cement of the imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 from the prison sentence of his six month imprisonment on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he ple@@ aded his sentence of imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Council of information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Iranian government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information Minister allowed a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the Ministers agreed to permit another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als to restore the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman .
other violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ ley , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set their operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional release ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can work their work .
3. to protect press freedom in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the opinion of opinion and freedom of unification and the right to get peacefully together .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
for the need for medical research on site , there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined have a grave impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building own research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of Central Committee at the Center for the study of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he searched for the HIV virus , before it decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡@@ mi healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ i National Program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are important current sciences topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being self @-@ makers .
the solutions we get , are often not well applicable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is she adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent these challenges .
the system , that journals are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &apos; Pay@@ wall &apos; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change global food production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton sets the salad for the 1980 &quot; s in the USA .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that is grown and consumed by NASA @-@ Astron@@ au@@ ts in the outer space .
almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was done only by its own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ads it can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents g@@ athers not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been en@@ rolled on more and more plants like grain or cart@@ els . due to this trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but he now takes longer because his work is increasingly complicated by ever more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like going to be a rock rock in a river in order to p@@ down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that this patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand the court , no one can breed any more new Sal@@ at@@ eries , because all the features are already patented , so he is doing so well and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and tries to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS have bred @-@ red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety of red@@ ress in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there is tested whether plants are grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
she was called into life to ensure that some plant species and products are not protected as intellectual property and thus used for plant breeders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bree@@ der can ple@@ dge that other seeds can use them freely in seeds .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who are buying their seeds , to breeding them , and not immediately agree - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds still plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter , or only little by imposing seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified crops .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , crop , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability . &quot; those who are offered good , locally and sustainable production @-@ produced vegetables , should also know that the way it is bred on farmers markets , should also know that the way that vegetables is bred .
nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit to helping others make their seeds free of charge . thus their action is opposed to pat@@ rol seeds and plant species .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available Gen@@ pool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant materials , which is thus becoming more restricted , indispensable .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , employed in her doc@@ torate with gene@@ tical variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ els as intellectual property is protected , whereby it is not usable for plant breeders either at all or only un@@ usable .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ alleged plants like wheat are patented in even more large style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred so that they have targeted features - from such a way through which their taste or colour is improving up to such , because of which they can prosp@@ er in certain environments and to with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available crop material for breeders intake by more and more patents . genetic diversity is , however , more necessary than ever , since the changed conditions are much worse , due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail we recognise Monsanto &apos;s speaker in C@@ arly Sc@@ en@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ cies and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company set up for the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the mind that intellectual property is limiting other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ based innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taking a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , such protection inhi@@ bits innovation not only , but encourages the public to provide more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent exists , certainly not innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long to grow to plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , would have been lost in the struggle .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives have not been attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es at the concept of pat@@ rons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant species &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders have ultimately no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , also breeding its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures for their cultivation of her@@ bi@@ cides are raising in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some middle @-@ sized enterprises ( such as Monsanto are moving to international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that bree@@ der would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant maintenance : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patent .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know my ri@@ vals are selling my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with what you think is quite simple in my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , describes an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds , and sell their own .
the German organization E@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding ) differ from country to country , why the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks at present the current practice of the European patent , which patents are allowed on conventional plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , in the farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa , to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems &quot; explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the next year of the official start @-@ up .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the globe to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , from which Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon realize it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially been respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian Government has documented the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
August , the network released a statement on Facebook in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ b@@ ale in spite of this attack and the re@@ plen@@ ishment of the Egyptian law and the constitution by which the law should actually defend its aim to un@@ cover freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the block and not re@@ trace our task . we insist on the task of fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 pages , such as b@@ sp@@ . the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar influ@@ encing network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of wave of web pages fallen to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and Human Rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemination of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write on accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider at which also the Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards held in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while watching the student &apos;s physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada sent to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means to him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ally @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the block@@ age of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a sie@@ ge of sie@@ ge ; a nar@@ row@@ ful murder , prec@@ inc@@ charge at the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ compression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this made technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors , possible through the byp@@ assing of inter@@ net@@ ting and private browsing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s were able to offer .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content , to which Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will additionally be dis@@ coura@@ ging that the cens@@ ors will have no legal basis behind closed doors whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can take action against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

day for day newspapers a whole Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old , shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ one day is murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be consuming pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ lift to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the violence achieved in Rio has been the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian government organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in the Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 . August , the editorial &quot; This is not normal , in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the images for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex crimes , etc . all , what happens from the civili@@ zed standard and which only happened in Rio , is in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision is no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not realize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper announces that it exists according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial writes the paper further :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , when it is distor@@ ted , also it can be used to indul@@ ge atrocities in the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
is the term &quot; War &quot; more than they have been useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra on the contrary to design@@ ate the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy from the media , and it could complic@@ ate the responsibility of the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military action in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
in remembrance : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the M@@ ord@@ ry per federal state , Rio has to place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company of South America , which stresses how Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stressed , since years the security policy of the state is repeated .
these safety measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to capture a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , the U@@ PP has led to several reports on channels and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly established police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the Convention established by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this challenges the state to use the means and ways that are typical for war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ ky balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police came up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to meet the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident had also made headlines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots that had escaped the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops .
according to victories , Worldwatch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the research institute The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of sie@@ ge .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is especially strongly affected by the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for a life of hundreds of civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition have taken out , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was imposed by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2013 , they have been controlled by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to the population on local or to be reli@@ ed on quot@@ as or by tunnel and control .
through the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ es Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria , they are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their authenticity makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of fungi , because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that have been fighting for three years to make this project well @-@ known and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ es Al@@ nah@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting Pil@@ zen , so Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12@@ 700 , but will continue to Monday , 04 . September 2017 , will continue to raise funds on Can@@ do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , local fuel fuel will be used from plastic , in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushroom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they test their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; textbook for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breach of sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
dissemination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by taking food @-@ remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the sie@@ ge becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience inspired by people in times of crisis and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many bor@@ eh@@ ole cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires , which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the week before , in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were violated as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks , spread across the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ areas with satellite images , only 2017 in Portugal is approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of wood burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture from the seriousness of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017

the un@@ predictable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the call for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection has not been able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al from the Confederation of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this any thing : there are dis@@ cord reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in ov@@ ations with high bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko will be investigated .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the forest form , which the government had introduced in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the commun@@ es that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law , which permitted the construction of the case to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article published by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly burning wood , itself , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to fires of this species .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , the website of the civil war of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens were looking for information or trying to contact address , offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the site and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of fire fighting and became so crucial in this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers watched the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who kept the fires , not ste@@ amed the site more than half a million hits .

two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ per@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afgh@@ an istan last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would not see her son a lot longer - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break down .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring it to the tractor .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ ed party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban for their hatred on Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal base . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ar who were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
back then , as was the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ per@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked .
there was no service there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years he left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran , and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing at the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek Auth@@ orities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day food to the needy .
it is true that Italy due to relative high ratings quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for exp@@ end@@ owed asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers can find in the country is catastrop@@ hic .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will take place in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording centre , if they officially submitted an application to asylum , which after the registration of asylum seekers can go on for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then there are people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it is also A@@ per@@ af .
but his inde@@ b@@ ish jo@@ kes helped A@@ shar@@ k to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ spi@@ af tasted his total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ limb@@ o .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
plenty of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years some of Afgh@@ ans have developed companies , including cutting plants , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to take part in the Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the staff of staff are largely refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far enough about the Italian food trade and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says As@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seriousness in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
legal report : legislative accus@@ ations from Egypt permit shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global interfaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament has checked a draft law , which pre@@ dict@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must register to use social networks within six months after a successful legislation on the website of the authority under stating their full name as well as their identification number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or prosecution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law that was advertised by sixty @-@ parliament@@ arians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is currently facing legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another member of Parliament reached a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher sanctions for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law the sie@@ ge of the president as well as state institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law of law , such a law would be wasted with pris@@ als and fin@@ es , so the right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law shall be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) that was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he made violence against demonstrators , demonstrated against military coup , fought against military coup , which led to the bai@@ li@@ ff of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years imprisonment on a court &apos; court &apos; .
recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison cell failed to bring it to human rights groups to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ cr@@ acking among other weapons @-@ owned , illegal assembly , murder and fear@@ ful murder .
in another case , a criminal course in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in advance of the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activists are listening to en@@ unci@@ ated documents
in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was founded mainly to an en@@ unci@@ ated action plan . the plan was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly a controversial law , the business@@ men and during the former regime would be accused by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali by the corruption accused officers .
on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published document , a light continues to look like the presidential plans to support the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources under stating article 11 of the Tunisian media system which ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis , he came to a witness in the case of Tunis .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission to write or share messages in social media .
it will also indicate that the registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analysts suspect that this is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is until now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese power citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only selective in order to protect the citizens of journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May gives state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to register in the provincial government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this name is part of a law published in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organise a list of online services , which allows the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make services responsible for removing content and to force it upon request for the suspension of user data .
these websites currently belong to websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and d@@ utz@@ warding of other services .
Turkish Court has Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a tur@@ quoise court ordered the block Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication existed , the site was blocked because it came to &quot; an information source that works with groups to raise a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is therefore , next to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but it has other technology companies and the civilian outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
