<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, have danced to American music, American authors have been read and operated by sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me, that I was basically a journalist because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The pelican letter, a terrible reporters who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who covered his interest inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free from methane Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, everything else is what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is as welcoming, that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it deals with its Engmindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague of it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the Party of nominate candidates.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigest person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met at Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world takes up a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumps's worldview was not consistent with the of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours trying to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Inintolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still she fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes that always with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those created by them are bodied by my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump began his way to nominees republican presidential Presidential candidates, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either condemned by racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook this stuff, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to that situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters are voted for Trump for them, because they want to regain control of a country that has been disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who have commented the cruel decision to lift a man who overlooks with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm.) WC.: as much as" "" "rejection of white against all other ethnicities;" "" "wordplay from white in references to the white and whiplash (which means much like slingerie), as it called the big Van Jones, has done exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world cherish the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always welcome, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's white promise, saying, to Hell with plurality, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said at the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a word of change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" said Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>

<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vociferous' NEIN '!</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan closed with words:" "" "God be praised that Mr. Trump, is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was like, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura, together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 miles south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikinde) has been playing in the municipality: one out of children and adults with their existing symphony orchestras, which with their musical instruments has found an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Paugo and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located on top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from re-value waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments produced from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycling is started under the direction of Favio Chavez in order to transform portions of the instrument into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all made from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayic and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article on the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place when the parents worked in the trash, the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of apostasy created violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from reprepared material and that is called The Assets.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world creates about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest people - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work successfully fight the illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practicing solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, that this ship had already been operated in livenian waters illegal fishing, before it searched out the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries have brought about accordingly and slightly inclined to welcome a lobrecher of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorers, Mosambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to place one of their ports and refused to give him an fishery pattern.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries, which you simply refused everything," "", "Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and followed by the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it did not succeed to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries who are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is going to be hidden, is why illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the intentional discontempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing were also hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-drafting, with the information between individual countries, so these actions are happening in real time, with trackable to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">Here, the individual countries, for example, share lists of existing licences, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour check.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of vessels also very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite channels.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in bottomous areas. also let you discover such suspicious travel routes - such as those that indicate that a ship has its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing lizard where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a Strafreebister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to remove penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is a significant financial loss for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Leader director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counselling company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD from lost sales, which invents the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing places that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among its practices, among other things, include the sailing under false flag, counterfeit Licenpapers, indicating the fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they take advantage of the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," says Long. "before, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You darling my port not to run'.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Komm to me" "". "and this is precisely this legal slip hole trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations into suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the International Food Safety Authority, FISH-i can provide information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our studies lead us quite far into the" "" "organized crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is designed to help FISH-i, procure ships more precise locations.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, helps to record the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen are using very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, economist at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be executed by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different informatics each other. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened a platform for Global Fishing Watch with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each individual pereble ship can be shown worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to an investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also terrify them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had earlier confiscated without license and hardly to reckon with consequences, they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 found, found the inspectors there on board towing networks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study subject." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars vanished by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "security is the objective to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia that first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was also without a license and were used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated in bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen made from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way to protect oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="201">The trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>

<seg id="203">Starting at the BÃ¼rde, the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years he held the family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieff. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978, Deputy Commander of Intelligence in the prison of La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="234">He gave me a little tree wrapped up, and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver.</seg>

<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officer in gendarmerie and I would never like to fall into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people also not have families to whom we were able to pass their mortal remnants?</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely apologize that older people felt offended by insufficient correction (the translation) of our turn," "" "said the Police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "frightful" older motorists in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "horribly" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents, are certainly cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19.460 ounces of Seniors. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For crossing, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills to address it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active domination of the target language - something that is the case with mother tongue. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother tongue should translate from English into French, not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as their native language, the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for the oversetting, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who will learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">A number of companies who do not have foreign employees, let translations come to company internally. then, the Japanese employees, whose Englisches are considered to be the best, no matter how good or poor his language skills are truly.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and puzzling phrases which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="453">If the case before judgment comes, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n can be landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo's court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas will not only be exploited as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, Koncourse had to sign up and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital AsunÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, purified the fridge, plasted the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was late, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time also was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to go hungry, but did not get any indefinitely food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the housekeeper as food from the fridge," she remembered.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings of the households Alvarenga, to stand beside him and editorial from Oppositionists such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo" to read.</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade her to give her faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He thought she was intelligent, but did not stick to her. "the householder had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would get there again" bad habits. "so they said that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of the Guarani to speak at home once again their native language Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation they had made to lose, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was absolutely clear that she got for everything she had paid from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about, are bullying and the rails who are exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a Criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was not able to invite anyone to home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time where friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The insulation was the worst of all, "says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society confuses the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can work advertisements for cleaning personnel and kindergarten in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administration of the group is PEPA Kostianovsky, a town in the district of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I'm looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="484">To learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please melted to you.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad got five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ãemby wrote that she had a eleventh girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ãemby, bot her 15 year old nigh. "she likes small children and is very pretty," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the third comment was written by "a girl from the inland, which would like to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the fibers turned into the ad even once:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear girlfriends, I have found one. I see if it works with her.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you, I write again when something is.</seg>

<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed on 11 March 2011 by the tsunami and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the progress made for the East Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years in order to reconstruct the lives of those who had been hit by the "Trinity disaster" from March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahou Shimpo newspaper has its head office in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a permanent prefectures in Japan Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated, because the tsunami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Cahou Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been reached after six years in order to rebuild the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding agency as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahou Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (s),, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">For the biggest success among the three prefectures, Miyagi was able to record 80 percent of the planned spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is equivalent to 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Similarly, one is still trying to settle six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by homes (s), kasetsu juutaku) in final substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation in 2011, while Miyagi was more successful in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergency accommodation. more than 75 percent of the evacuated shelters were settled in ultimate homes after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, at Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishery had re-recorded its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have attracted large-scale in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic bomb, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fukushima, are in the" "" "nuclear" "" "zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered once again but also Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports on the fact that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuated groups. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their receivers had changed across the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article explains the Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahou Shimpo carried out a survey to bring more information about the tsunami consciousness under the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that it was still not done enough in disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also raised their attention to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the tremendous earthquakes and the devastating tsunami, no, the Prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic accident, atomizer, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima almost 63 million people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in enduring spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the end of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated states still persisted in temporary shelters, older than 50 years old. they have to compete for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the federal universal of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several factions.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors performed him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial coma.</seg>

<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw material would manage around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From then onwards, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the breastfeeding of a total of 98 sugar farms, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar behrfabrik Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>

<seg id="659">Thus the place will be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>

<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They have been substitutes.</seg>

<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production serves not even for the supply of the community.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations Youth Day use Hip Hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youth from the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014 Workshoppers launch mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach teenagers, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities, and then together with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will allow the young participants to discuss themes such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance or whatever meaning to them.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the vinnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the kite-calum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the story of the Highway 16, also called "Highway the tears," a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen usually indicative young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey, how important the conservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have been included, the refrain on Cree is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in dialect in Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan stands the Strophe in transcript available, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you get our cry out.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will lift up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and lead our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they determined to the creators</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds Strophe in Sileninscription (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are in the proximity of the entrance being shocues sanpuru (s), "plastic models of dishes") offered by every food which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokicking district Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies that just produce plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic meals are so usual that they no longer find them any more. however, a new trend is turning into a showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media Links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shooters sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic banded cell bands like they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyo Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschema objects, as in this case, refrigerated magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shooters in refrigerators for a new exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essential settings is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a neuisen-don (a popular bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell-railing box.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile-box.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we prepared for the exhibition at Tokyo's railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that gives your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to be seen as an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the komni.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell-handed and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-oestrogen will be used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say," "" "wow, cool, now I can play my cell with salmon-rogens?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in Plastics can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone-stands has the shape of melmelted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and craytapes from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic dishes can be looked at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the "hashtag # that can be bought by the" hashtag # "s).</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to the Belieferment of the restaurant industry. such as the shocues sanpuru for example.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of foreign and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the Vermists and transmissions regularly appear only in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa box, thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the dream or the churches which have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each body, behind every bone refund in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds might never be cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">That's why the Mexican news portal is called "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading") initiated this sacrifice a voice and tell stories about people working in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug adversaries and entire communities have to drive a lot of kilometers to make something as easy as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video called "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (deutsch: "how fear lives change") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father, who has been called secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost only one day their father, their four siblings, their husband and two their nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have placed, go and go to graves after the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are standing on the insurance of my Father, but that does not get them unpaid because the one is asking for a death.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" declare why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We need not only show the faces of those who are fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the breakable and the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a leserin of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in Central America.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what shape it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with disease and sensory journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come by newspaper Forkiosks every day and see the title pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones, that is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be unvalid or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-year cousin thinks he will be Narco (English: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they mocking those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories come to blogging numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inelessness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were" "" "scouring" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade that they remain spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "four months blackmail in the main town district: how a family with threats have been looted." in it, she describes how armed crime month was extormented for month of money from her business until they had destroyed not only the business, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never dies, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers as well.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will lead or killing you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to cries. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of the generations" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells him that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, ptillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the Babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine cars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">However, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all life of violence and having to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years earlier, when he was just a couple of blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father that was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw it:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killers according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010, the prosecution issued 3103 Morde. this equals 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that have organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are still living in view of new headlines. this project reminds us of those that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco," the model journalism project Narcodata launched in 2015, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs trade, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to uplift a rumour or falsification a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after the first time arose? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it was misleading to protect tragedies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a petrol station crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked off and exploded. there were 230 people around.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa was second biggest country for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous pathways, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically this fell to the victim of the petrol trucks.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fireball, the dutzing houses, including a movie in the proximity, which was full of people who were watching the soccer team.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses debrated and shortened corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned out to irreconcilability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur-user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Multiere photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example for this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows sold-hollow bodies, which are ranked on the ground as people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been applied several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, though real, but not associated with related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the drafted villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically by atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse were in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one has left to belong to corpses," "" "said one to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images could follow the follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsettled, but the army-based in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt at Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was mistaken for the fact and potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only a series of miscredentials; Africa Check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases, the image was taken as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further bring personal comments like this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, the ones who could escape, rape and a few deaths, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page, which claimed that the President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information.</seg>

<seg id="929">The photo was used regarding greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians from Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how a African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion is important to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth examining how images in connection with these efforts are being used.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers cannot give a longer belief in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who have contributed to unintentional share of the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest that mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowed it the real atrocity of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. at times these images are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, worry is that violent images can desensitise people and spectators and feel the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, the investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) endeavored to provide language enthusiastic to offer a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: they express certain situations or emotions that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all contradicts stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or phrase is sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes something context is needed to accurately understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected already for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find example words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- sample yourself to receive your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that you feel after having awakened in the sun at cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They compensate other cultures, revealing other poetry and arouses our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you will see how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more of these "insurable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narratives wants to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storyteller tell, from Flickr-users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the telling of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. this is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been held for 2015 events, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children who born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns, the diversity - secure rooms where residents do not need to forget who they are to be counted.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often with it often," "" "for purposes of these events instead," "" "listen" "" "the listens to estimate, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their presentation will result in getting the audience on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions that language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller of Rassidatou have also taken the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of the narratives.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamusara will be asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on 72 million US dollars, participated in the last 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organizations involved in a mass rally; the march started on the puertorian Capitol, the Government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is organised in Berlin devoted an event to the # FreeBasque campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, manager of book sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints' made books within three to five days, lases excerpts from the book of cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and is available licenced here, contains a number of elevations which deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book I want to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers, which has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Adra prison directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on his present state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us have to start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developers for open source and digital activist has been in detention for Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to be transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police bases on the basis of a" strictly secret "marked by the Military Court from his cells in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death part against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a vital role in promoting access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project called Bashan, writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Bassels cultural prototypes prescient as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the pioneer of numerous civilizations and here are merging Greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel couldn't know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which is not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time-capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically this project has not yet been closed until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I've spent my entire life with it, of freedom to dream and bazaar taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English in, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each he asked. he has taught other incarcerers to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other incarcerties as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a provocation, which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They put the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or imposed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17 723 Syrians have died in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption expuring director after dismissal of dismissal to preexpire post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique acted with anger to a corrupt fall in which a government member returned after half his sentence in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was Diodino Cambaza that was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants in 2010 (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public transit of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was presented by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his return to the company, which happened on 19 April then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor of the Republic, which embodied the request, there would be no obstacles for Cambaza to get back his old post, as the company had no disciplining process according to his detention facility.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not accept the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with the German wave, condemned the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "poses a back-back in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and even a backward step with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have led to a lack of disciplinations against the resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seems obvious, however, and prompted no proper legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, this behaviour also rejects and considers the case as "reluctant."</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be counselor after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half of them were drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and record his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become reintegrated into the company which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, Young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says, the director possessed no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him I cannot believe someone was rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massive insulted.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the State, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it only served itself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handler it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired who was uploaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only remain in mind for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp, intersecuting and - by far - prophetic redundant.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral acts was, when he energise that "an ambitious person is capable of everything, also the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that that is not so. he changes the tactics but he does not withdraw from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "a ambitious person is a criminal" "" "criminal" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also rejected:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat for 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar Pae" means chickpese or araged.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well known Social Network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word "Kalar".</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or in general use as an adjective." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical national-nationalist movements gave the word an extremely defledged connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically call hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his usage have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with underlying different meanings, which have the same letter like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair will be written to Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (spage), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookier-er Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post office of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether she knew how he could relieve his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the fragment (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that she would decrease hate speech of radical nationalists, but she also stressed that Facebook could be analytic before it all posts that disseminate in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism does not understand what you write on faces.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar Pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dreckery nationalists, to spread the hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to be circumcised by nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, disseminate the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of percussions is often a catcher and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The writer Aung Kaat described, such as Facebook began to delete his postings, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and sent to me the light, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the Post of the Facebook Community standards did not mention. "</seg>

<seg id="1343">The hehe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously by a law adopted by the Parliament to ban this practice so that it is now under 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change in the law a number of members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities participated in practice, and in May 2016, the leader of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country said that the state cannot interfere with, since that, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "" "" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of UN's rights law, the minors" "", "defined for every human being under the age of 18." ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.8 percent, and 18 percent were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the Federal Chancellery was confirmed that of 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were eager to create laws at home-marriage, followed at the foot and pleasing much support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nonetheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for instance, had no concern to say the critics of the children of children, they ought to be condemned again to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition worked for tension in this actually incomplicated matter, and at some point doubts on whether the opposition would agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must approve and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the stations of the country gave on Facebook a status update, which was posted by Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill draft against the children's before was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided prior to the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was enthusiastic because the laws of the children's before were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who held a ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary talk needed at the heart of the matter, but do you know what? children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of the opinion was, it was definitely long enough to create the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status-Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:,, Excellent news!</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">Now, the delicate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious belief 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft version of the spouses Act was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "months ago Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems his promise now." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Advocate Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it is quite legitimate if Maharaj would act against the law, most social media users, however, would address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion in general, in a way we would say, rather talk of the problem, that the state, our daughters, protects them that they are likely to be mischievous madness, "would you be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places around the world where the children of children are legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they are underestimated.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia-page was presented on January 18, 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now blocked Turkey the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on the Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day will be more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information and to share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and journalists and fans of TV-series are fighting against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques I used are used to use bypass tools for block websites (an up-to-date article by the New York Times report that Turkey has the third-largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been reading article from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, finding regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the first-known country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform deduced all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-machine connections) which does not base on the system of domain names and making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost, IPFS has reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Since we have heard the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we put everything to place Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least look at all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also indicated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirror page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to hollow similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia, is brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attaches to a different URL that is not the original one. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied. they were blurry with bad positioning and washed-out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry himself a camera with himself and try to understand the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland, right next to Chitwan National Park, gives it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepas wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook like this first class position in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was at and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as bad as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he was already standing by faces to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home, because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the beheavik appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stareth me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepas nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and often lived in a tent in order to make up the Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds, who live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should be the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state Odisha by a shame and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also do not name their wives, is also disseminated among men. however, they have much less beadmittances to fear, if at all, they should not come out of this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, were nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club, and became quickly became the main round of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as child healing, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected tics, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women, and they have also made it the ambassadors of change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her panel of discussion showed that their husbands did not name their husbands' name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy of a problem with which women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "speaking the name of their husbands" "" "is a bread, whom they have fully contracted and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition indicates that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stick to it is regarded as a histified, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted, that we have never thought of up to that discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never known her husband until now, at home try out how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh still long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage Rohini started her first discussion slub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, most of all girls and women were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video, the women tried to get the discussion with a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra on the Breaks of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kicked her throughout the exercise only, a different decided to let the whole circulate frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush about it, with an old bracelet broken, the women decided that they would actually try their husbands to name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put into his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club-member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she warmed her, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="1512">A husband of an attendance was less understanding and the situation arrained in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanized red spot on the forehead, which shows the marriage:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the petrol-red spot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed, and I listened with it to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but they think they are now in a better position to vote themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion slub is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are on a trip with every issue of Discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to worry about who they could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities on our husbands, never talked so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to it, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion panel, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris for their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted a salty spa, a vast shirt of a pants, wear; they did not have to drink.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much arguments and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes, morals associated with the Saris and much more, smuggled Rohini her own couple Kurtas (upper inhibits) into a panel discussion, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion slub have changed a bit, the Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but listening back then again to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it even, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands: one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Papers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hastiff of more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman gets home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably was recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017, at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissidents of Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June, having been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion." after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China was involved.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case as "an internal matter, and a spokesman told him to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, permit or give it a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully excavated.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brenda have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government was in fact nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to re-record the salmon to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After reading the message that Liu was seriously fallen ill, the Nobel committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick its price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to its detention, he was unable to grant his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house of house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as it was in an explanation on 30 June 2001:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to elevate all restrictions of Mr. Lius spouse and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad shared that the Americans "wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad, so that he may help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A speaker in the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message received the Chinese authorities not only freeing liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the invitation of the US message drew a devastation response from China to itself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that" "" "no country has the right to make an unreasonable and irresponsible comment on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the following couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and judicial system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also have a decision introduced to the Congress to push the Chinese government on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally release.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he may go to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote on 3 July, Berlin hope that Liu "gets all the medical support he needed, and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources taught in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the vortex of Liu could be overshadowing to the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum prompted China to provide adequate medical care and give it the possibility to worry about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP previously that Lius woman, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, freedom and rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June to free Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all treatments that he, regardless of where, requires. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news transmitter France Info has already reported that the French government called Liu in the country was well known, the State Department gave out that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of landlandmatters in Taiwan called on June 27 on June 27th, release on Liu and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator People Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Party Party also urged China to permit the sick intellectual Liu to treat himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June by Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was severely punished, led to a harmonic, more stable and wealthy, which in turn has contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is on an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should Singapore be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities, an infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, Whose Country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons that were led by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one can't measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what it appeared imitless undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the issue, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian machinations, who pretend to be the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the last week of Shanmugam the answers to his American guests were given regarding our press, our judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions lay him with non-answers to rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so in which country our city belongs to...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our little K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By posting on the blog of his comment, he points out about criticisms that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference, so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could better understand, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the Mitterbook.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "", "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He spent Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore was not a country" "", "he obviously has not meant it in that sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore had said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew by Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expect - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review decomplies the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "disbelief a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian despeaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role inside the cabinet, the statements made by Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world being revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is asked me most in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, sorry I am sorry," "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and back in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my view then most often the default answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, nature." many Canadians cook perhaps inwardly in anger, when they are held for Americans, but don't bother me that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that Canadians differ from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian Flag well visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the march in Iraq and 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried out small aphornets to their luggage to differ from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">With us there is no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are courteous.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We also say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would mean to me nothing if you would change from Dallas for example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, as "nice" to be described, basically to be mirror-like - as well as the good-natured, gentle, but tragic ironically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian Double).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem lies in that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that one can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen to make a walk around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main piece of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps simply cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I have now connecting with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our Prime Minister has made Canada quite sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that continued to pursue the Junta is their decision to buy expensive submarine boats, although safety experts warned they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax wear.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black supply van before putting them into a dormitory storage, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1811">These settlements are also called Geisterties in Abchsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has risen in 16,000 people after over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old palace, a small woman with a corals pink glasses and gold-coloured ear-rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Wallachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This pointed name is to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haiti that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with pale, abstained walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people come to full busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also have already slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can not pay, they are massaged them with a balms that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama was a reasonable nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao Family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghoche) posizes with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other guides from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," Felix Michelet, a Guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and the Africans often travel the circuit and that Africans speak already on Whatsapp of Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building agent on builders of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest for Mom Africa for months now. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go back," "" "reply he smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells us that her guests will often send her messages to text messages, if they have gone, to grind them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith was the driver of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only funken of hope for the migrants who travel through Wallachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs of Valencia.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter we have added to Valencia and his family migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">"" "" "" "Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are going through." ""</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "says." "" "I experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his job site from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Wallachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to take the money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tape he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, single-known, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy to have her house full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she is about her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African mouths who has done her a lot, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and Old.</seg>

<seg id="1964">However, the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app just after they had replaced the app, messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Communication, the App was able to determine the sources and distribution routes to the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage pornographic web pages, of online scams, trousers and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers allow to manipulate the home network of a person or stealing from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, depressive ethnic minorities, such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely internet shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet "Images from the China" ("" "s)" "" "images of the China" "", "the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, at the policeman inselfling, whether they had installed the surveillance app." ""</seg>

<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang are potentially a reaction to the instructions of the city-party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and institutions related to the institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jamaanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he lots to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top of his family house, which since 1967 belongs to them; the year in which Israel had forced its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of the Palestinian Arab world. all these issues are found not only in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and according to his own statement, he can sympathise with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though it is not open, it hurts a particular disinclination to the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian refugees" - so he describes himself, even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own life circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I am saying," I am a human being, "while he poured into waters in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "the Israeli law also states that public consumption of food is illegal while Ramadan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee in a sensing hot junitag had little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slaughtering makes warm coffee and the swaths of the kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is inevitable to do some fundamental things - like drinking in the public during Ramadan Water - to land not in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens brought a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic State of Action - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontal Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also assert that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that provides the altproven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila said the Jamaican people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "which continue to use" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply silken rhetoric, but actually become a clear and clear reality reflected in Jordan, which appear in Hdaibs work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib's traditional gender standards are gluing by having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have endured sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lower-known woman whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years Jordan has increased the number of "Honorary murders' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016; however, the number of Honorary infrastructure reached its peak; however, in addition, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried victims of murder, or domestic violence in appropriate ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to fight against terrorism from 1954, women can be suspended in a detention centre, "and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, not to shy away from issues that are in his country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he is able to separate his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and speech.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Near East, Mann.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was accused of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically negatively led.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, "which one wants" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still very censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular online OnlineProgramme Roya to remember that his comments from the context were swept up and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance is not talking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, which remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks, if Abu Nuwhat was to work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century was open to homosexuality, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive votes are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jamaican news service adopted several former government boards and members of the curriculum, with the reason they had expressed critical on the problems posted in social media with the problems that were deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs just say the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has drilled Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it seems like Hdaib - consists of slow, oppressive and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreaming, like millions of other Arabs, also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreams not only of it, his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature is closer to genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, struggle uniforms and in artificial kind. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until then, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One thought it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory implies that the forks, the drummers and dancing over more than one thousand years, and from a time date, in the armies from the west Japan marched in the northeast in order to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two hard cars are straight to see.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road raub and illicit drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to make themselves more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairstyles who can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, even has an annual event inspired, the competition of the hairdressers, Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create from them the most beautiful Looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy who found himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to find young people to find out their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of poor advice to find a training in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the bidder opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in March prior to March, reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the post "love message of guerrilla warfare," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love notes to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel tired, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspires them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), the young people ressing letters to write guerridescent letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, her country was a place of historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombian), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatal of the peace contract as such that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is still a long way ahead of Columbus before you can talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warriors who have been faced for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society again, who had accustomed themselves to life in fear and in some cases deep hatred towards" "" "guerrilla war" "", "must now take up their ranks and support it when building a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian Colombians would have to help and in the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guerrilla struggles to welcome them back in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla, which should be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the man we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love notes, but those forget that they need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told, he continued to share his love with people this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is present in all major towns of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought any one would forgive</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation Bogota in the camp to transfer letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of FARC presented themselves as they did earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of shelter from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the Policy scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the Governors of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrilla warrior live), I saw an guerrilla shock, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him nevertheless," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter that someone has written for me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that is why I answer it. "then the tears ran through the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him in firm and sat down beside the pomegranches.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there which is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all grew up as war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC made the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the whole Colombian people have acted. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in that country more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this scale, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard their hearing and had no electoral law, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were turned around, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">"" "" "" "columbianists was prophesied that after the disarmament of peace would prevail." ""</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to protest to weapons and protest for their rights. and this is completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now bet on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring the sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horror, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months regarding persecution of pregnant men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damoklesworth over the "" "" the "" "" TQ community "" "" has not only emerged overnight. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who had shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines from several months after reports have been published, that the disposities, torture and killing queer men in the Republic discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechnyan authorities, the suspicious men of festivities and they were in secret prisons in Argun barrels.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Ever since their childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was born, her became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnwere experienced by the genital equals of their landlady, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Because of fear for their life they moved to the USA in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day someone was told me that somebody needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transittering that put into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone was thinking of what I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his chastity friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya, who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents were made by the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bag from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechen: "how long do you want to dishonored the family, do you stain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keypoints in my right pulmonary poultry.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which medical wings are you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, because my male name is still; but the doctor understood and set me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a muslia, a caudal name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded to send me to Chechnya in order to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me I must prove it by going up without the streets of the street; others wanted me to treach on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have granular size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">You said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed your family, but the whole of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">During the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark window windows and a numeric plate with a 95 drone.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-righteous friends handed over the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I quit the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without register without letting me, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you are stagnant. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about the gender equality but this is a tablotopic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally caudal elements are still wearing in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, these psychic barrier can I do not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person she reminds himself of her past - that is, in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who are dorsal?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has been fed in Argun and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't shut out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In order for me, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood genugging.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still swaying men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives, or who were dropped by their relatives in order to put Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">So far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say," "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked some village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically underwent to radicalise themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a messenger, or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in Argun at a half and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that lots of people in this prison have disappeared after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there are still no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise you could not have these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people that belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, even before 2003, I was already in whole Great Britain, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally wanted to approach the" "" "civil war" "", "but ultimately brought us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the aria law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored lashes, carried tube jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of the Sharia has never used me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches was standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a waste of phrases: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spice is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children when who make themselves fun about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so just have her eyes closed before you, because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this gnawaken work?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but foremost about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiles and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic was constantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I am not doing much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Otherwise, I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for fifteen Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, gathering information, I begged them to the hospital and help them to get food Postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves as I clad to refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: take a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">In this way, nature, it has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to prophesy you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gay men.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabals have, who, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many thinking about Transitional in men who love men, and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a Trugutter.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life-settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be here personally, but my final intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in self-murder within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers under an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase of self-murder.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August backward the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to clear the flames again, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and campaigners warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights was that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have to be based.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable due to persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in the majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to ride their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took over power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most demanding and most valuable areas of agriculture for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is developing slowly, and the local population gets only little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahwazi Arabs, systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, built the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only resulted in destroying the devastation caused by dryness in the region and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Minister of Co-operation, work and social welfare, applied that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed the elementary school, ended 55% a secondary school and have 45% university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices, that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," said to a "heightened rise" of the number of self-murder among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse recently. reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz, newly emerging ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As functionaries and institutions preferred not set up Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi, the access to jobs in all sectors is deported.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their living outside their home ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi as even the Arabic name at the workplace can not be tolerated, because speaking the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, who have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, propose human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with the feminism, also with the intersectional struggle"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide zur and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even set well thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth covering, and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and i will be double and triple, including.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS community, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from Diaspora, if I mention, on which kind we have been physically, psychologically and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, not to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all women agree that women - all women - come together to uplift their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it that there are in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and provenance earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are subjected to a higher risk with a migration background to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all human beings, neither skin colour, have the same rights; on the other hand I can not join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, which refuse to take into account the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won't fight my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner stood in 1851 in their speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which black woman is a human and marginalised nature in historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join forces which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to be silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different arrivals and borders itself from the White Feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and reframing the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather stubborn to me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that Intersetionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define our own ideas according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, author of the book Africana may well: as we can defend ourselves (for example: Africa-Womanismus (about: Africa-Womanism) that we can defend ourselves by establishing ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are totally secure and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Over the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special concern by Kurdistan in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution on his church.</seg>

<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war, construction of water bodies, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-government organisation Waterkeeper Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - that is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed for the protection of the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissar said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their expartners, who had become violent in opposition to violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, useful also the acute display of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women do not even report, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who mistreate them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general at all in law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 beats and Statistical 2 Invisible shortcomings and a legal system that nothing undertmm3 Paraguay laws: good approach, faulty implementation of bats and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are genuinely mixed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genomics at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different indications and reports that do not even accumulate the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District Court of 9600 ads, because of domestic violence. at 70% of them it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace process. here, 86% of the ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads said 40% of women that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayic women's Minister in Ana Baiardi, only a few of those criminal offences are actually displayed. "on every woman, who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, coming 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "to any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, come two women who do not do this" "", "they explained the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not an own criminal offences, law enforcement agencies can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on the basis of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning they didn't want it, but then there was still. this should not regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but two years she carried the psychical violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only women have happened to be inferior, because they are deceived by violent males.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana use social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name to mention, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long in Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some co-blame for it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not derived from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te CREO ("I think you") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Your wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements on the authorities without a result and also by their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partner who developed into an impenetrable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the paraguayischen Parliament which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼rth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiUnaMenos (# non-Requieter) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft law foresees to explain Femizid to a standalone criminal offences and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law that they feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions are paved, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original legislature had planned, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which have to present the victims of violence by themselves, if they simply want to refund and provide a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature had no sufficient financial resources available to it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay acts as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A reconsideration must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been altered. however, among other things, a passage was painted, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omanic authorities have closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of its reporting about corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he held an old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim al-Maamari and Numeral Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried in court, but came back again later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had put his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The domination of the sultans is identified by the persistent effort of security forces, in particular by domestic security, including press freedom, limiting media freedom, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and discredit other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hinders citizens, also activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn paper, their closure and imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim al-Maamari, editor of Azamn, announced after the newspaper had appeared in the judiciary on 26 July 2016. in it, it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the Deputy Chief Editor Yousef Al-Haj, who has worked as a chief editor after Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed at an undetermined time after the Minister of Information Minister had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way, including online, will be banned from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial took place in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court condemned the three journalists to prison prisons and ordained the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were condemned both among other things because of disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "subdigging of the state" state.</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year prison organ and fines in the amount of 3,000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year career was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a penalty of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after having the use of "an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a bail was fixed at the amount of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronouncement of the imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court said Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 from the prison sentence of his six month imprisonment on 10 April 2017. al-Haj is still in prison, where he pleaded his sentence of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Council of information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper looks after attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Minister of Information Minister allowed a directive with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information Minister personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and thus the Ministers agreed to permit another time against the decision of the Court of Appeals to restore the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The permanent closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Alley, the first independent online newspaper of the country to set their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the permanent closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist Al-Haj the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities on:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditional release;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrior 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need for medical research on site, there are two reasons: for a lack of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined have a grave impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in building own research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrior is Director of Central Committee at the Center for the study of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he searched for the HIV virus, before it decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrior discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrior speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results. I support the sami National Program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are important current sciences topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being self-makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, are often not well applicable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is she adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent these challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system, that journals are only accessible to payment (the so-called 'Paywall'), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton sets the salad for the 1980 "s in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that is grown and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in the outer space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years, Mortons's work was done only by its own imagination and the question how many salads it can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents gathers not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been enrolled on more and more plants like grain or cartels. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but he now takes longer because his work is increasingly complicated by ever more restrictions.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they withstand the court, no one can breed any more new Salateries, because all the features are already patented, so he is doing so well and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">She was called into life to ensure that some plant species and products are not protected as intellectual property and thus used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can pledge that other seeds can use them freely in seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who are buying their seeds, to breeding them, and not immediately agree - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member board Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds still plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, or only little by imposing seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, crop, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability." those who are offered good, locally and sustainable production-produced vegetables, should also know that the way it is bred on farmers markets, should also know that the way that vegetables is bred.</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available Genpool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant materials, which is thus becoming more restricted, indispensable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, employed in her doctorate with genetical variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartels as intellectual property is protected, whereby it is not usable for plant breeders either at all or only unusable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-alleged plants like wheat are patented in even more large style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have targeted features - from such a way through which their taste or colour is improving up to such, because of which they can prosper in certain environments and to withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available crop material for breeders intake by more and more patents. genetic diversity is, however, more necessary than ever, since the changed conditions are much worse, due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail we recognise Monsanto's speaker in Carly Scento that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four gencies and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company set up for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the mind that intellectual property is limiting other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant-based innovations promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically taking a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "therefore, such protection inhibits innovation not only, but encourages the public to provide more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent exists, certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to grow to plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, would have been lost in the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives have not been attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "overall, Morton interferes at the concept of patrons" "" "plant species" "" ":" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders have ultimately no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "those who breed a variety, also breeding its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures for their cultivation of herbicides are raising in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some middle-sized enterprises (such as Monsanto are moving to international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder would be innovative by the Avoid of plant maintenance: "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know my rivals are selling my varieties within a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with what you think is quite simple in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, "which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, describes an" open source "seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds, and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Ecol is working on an "open source" license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding) differ from country to country, why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks at present the current practice of the European patent, which patents are allowed on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, in the farmers, operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa, to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for "Open Source" seed systems "explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for the next year of the official start-up.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the globe to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, from which Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon realize it.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially been respected, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "so Luby." "" "we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food is." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian Government has documented the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network released a statement on Facebook in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Network for Human Rights Information abbale in spite of this attack and the replenishment of the Egyptian law and the constitution by which the law should actually defend its aim to uncover freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the block and not retrace our task. we insist on the task of fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 pages, such as bsp. the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar influencing network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of wave of web pages fallen to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnist and Human Rights research, Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he does not write on accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider at which also the Ziadas blog is native, on the other hand is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards held in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards, while watching the student's physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada sent to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfatally-Sisi; and even though the blockage of the blog may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a siege of siege; a narrowful murder, precinccharge at the national Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Excompression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this made technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blockage of vendors, possible through the bypassing of internetting and private browsing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs were able to offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content, to which Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will additionally be discouraging that the censors will have no legal basis behind closed doors whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can take action against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are arguing.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day newspapers a whole Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old, shot in school," "" "Everyone day is murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe consuming pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airlift to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the violence achieved in Rio has been the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in the Rio-known newspaper "Extra" on 16. August, the editorial "This is not normal, in which it announced, a new section called" War in Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The images for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any big city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. all, what happens from the civilized standard and which only happened in Rio, is in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision is no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that does not realize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper announces that it exists according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial writes the paper further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, when it is distorted, also it can be used to indulge atrocities in the police, which only shoots and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "War" more than they have been useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira on the contrary to designate the violence as a "war." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy from the media, and it could complicate the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military action in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In remembrance: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2781">These safety measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to capture a Favela by using a massive police station and a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, the UPP has led to several reports on channels and repressions against poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly established police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the Convention established by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were violated as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time Aperaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghan istan last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it then, she knew that she would not see her son a lot longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy should break down.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring it to the tractor.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara domed party Eb-e-Wahdat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban for their hatred on Hazara-known Taliban were getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal base. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went in Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself, in order to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as was the life of Afghan refugees in Iran shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered Aperaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hanging nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years he left his life without Papers in Iran, and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing at the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek Authorities had rejected its asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice the day food to the needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relative high ratings quotas is a kind of second chance for expendowed asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers can find in the country is catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the Human Rights organization Civil Rights for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffering from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers will take place in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording centre, if they officially submitted an application to asylum, which after the registration of asylum seekers can go on for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who have no money for an accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it is also Aperaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his indebish jokes helped Ashark to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction sector, Aspiaf tasted his total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schnellimbo.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis success story is now subject of the documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Plenty of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years some of Afghans have developed companies, including cutting plants, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "besides, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) that was arrested on 13 August 2013, when he made violence against demonstrators, demonstrated against military coup, fought against military coup, which led to the bailiff of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident, four years imprisonment on a court 'court'.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison cell failed to bring it to human rights groups to bring the accused of prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, hypocracking among other weapons-owned, illegal assembly, murder and fearful murder.</seg>
