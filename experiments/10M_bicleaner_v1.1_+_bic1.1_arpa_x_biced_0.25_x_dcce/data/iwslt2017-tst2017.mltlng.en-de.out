this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before any one heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA have illeg@@ ally ab@@ ed by phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a catastrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence service in which the CIA is literally exagger@@ ating Iran into an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and called on him to call on its alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and to head journalists .
according to First Constitutional Review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the people they give .
thus , when the government at R@@ isen ank@@ le , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional .
suddenly , though it claims for years that it would be crucial in their case , the demands of the government of R@@ isen were dropped .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and sources can hide themselves less and less .
rather than to fail and cr@@ acking statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have been kept secret , without his permission , his telep@@ hon@@ y secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even travel documents with the list of his flights .
in the middle of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers with his lawyer . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all the U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government moves too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we set off the press work , which should be protected by the first constitutional request , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ ying all .
but just as technology is allowed to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and although they can take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in testimonies .
today there are communication software , which has not yet been written as an R@@ isen book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source super@@ visor system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news web site , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that has access to the respective news agency .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that jeop@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is to us to make sure that not only technology providers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility of making mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
the about mis@@ hes in the supply of soldiers modest and will report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental collabor@@ ator , the alarm to contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a wall street in@@ sider that warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to impose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of the story was released . &#93; &#91; the &apos; Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; revealing that ri@@ kes and mighty &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness around an explanation . &#93; this week we have been resident of messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , such as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister is res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad attacks in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s plant@@ ations , famous cell@@ ists .
now there will be a lot of rich people there and others who are nervous to wait for the next release , and for the next unvei@@ led documents .
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency owner or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we take ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal .
all over the world discussion media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens , can be used by some few to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ s@@ cri@@ b .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans that have occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
well , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see many more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to create a company as a reference note .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ ds to z@@ oom especially appealing investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ Companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring about money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cking it that all proposals made up to a lawyer by our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre @-@ pre@@ conditions . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course there was no money given to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who made suggestions submitted to our co@@ vert investigation .
it is not about a single top political , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and in order to cope with , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever be changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but when borrowed optim@@ ist , I really see that there is quite a lot to change .
in the last couple of years we have seen bre@@ aches to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU seized on a national level at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind sha@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who know the problem and use it to stop through laws this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finish the in@@ transparency that will now end this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
that is the story , as I had almost been kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ ow@@ ling .
a day after I completed my design study , I made a rear @-@ farm sale .
one type of the red Maz@@ da stayed there and looked at my things .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip all over the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep for tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he certainly says he would go to peace @-@ house , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Mac@@ ed@@ ar !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how to ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a game of alien@@ ating in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , shut up my toes at the door , and shut my bedroom door shut .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me today is hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my views completely .
perhaps the people who were sold me in their childhood as strangers , actually friends , who were just waiting to be discovered ?
living on my air mattresses , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a time @-@ jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WiFi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattresses on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham &apos;s t@@ ines is completely different , because we did it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we had passed our last guest and the door came into the lock , strong , Brian and I sat down .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time , and could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers .
we wanted to find out if one could make of it a business concept .
so we presented to the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the Internet they can also invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but , they do not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one pointed out to the things that one can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design so do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we claim .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your bar@@ ren cell phone to your left side .
this silent approach of panic , you now feel -- -- is exactly what they feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the sper@@ ous cell phone in your hands ?
most are the sense of responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for that reason can our company exist .
only once so , who now has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you proc@@ laim on Twitter that it is backed by president of the President ?
you can return your phones now .
now you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced to his name ; if he had told him where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 evaluations , all say : &quot; he can really have very well @-@ wrapped phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when your mobile phone would have to leave ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system rein@@ forces confidence is decisive .
at the beginning we were doing some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to submit negative assessments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their evaluations before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how most likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social preference .
it will be exciting if you add the call to a person -- in our case by evaluations .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation can be common .
so the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
furthermore , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are concerned .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you tell too little , for example , &quot; hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it tells you how , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your home ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can one create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers .
with what we had not reck@@ oned , the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices .
here you can see how many people do our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was not met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been allowed to devast@@ ated parties or have apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests to be in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves .
fortunately , the 123 million nights had only a fraction of a problem .
because people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , it may be wonderful .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive a hospital in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a byp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they get books over .
you can even longer stay longer without saving the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay is starting .
but those relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is a economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lease &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of it open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is compared with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic .
what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?
what if at any place to visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a group there , to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a bar pent@@ ine quarters that you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would build apartments from the ground up to one another ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of the common part ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces , which belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people who were moved out of their children . incub@@ ators have been launched .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . our platform alone will host 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger , or even host .
the idea does not seem as crazy as it was taught to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was also before .
there were already similar websites .
so why did it just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find that astonishing ,
quite overwhelming .
I must think every time on when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or re@@ pressed , a brain @-@ washing , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media is the people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee house -- double es@@ presso , with cream .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ er @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ sts ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ li@@ in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I met my decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as homo@@ sexual person , as some of my friends , but as a mus@@ li@@ in . I chose the Hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cont@@ end was : at that time it was a feminist statement of independence , and it was true to me that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Koran .
the beauty of rhythm takes me sometimes to tears .
I see myself in it myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody percei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I later had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had dinner too late , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; issu@@ ance . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people spl@@ itting from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like this ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked but in the N@@ u converted me the actions of others of a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to go to a new city and start studying .
I remember , as we headed -- as we headed -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , the said : &apos; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ed you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that one held for Muslims and sm@@ iled into the outdoors .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ts on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have lowered the anger of people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only puts the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be seen as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , creators and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
it may stop some parking spaces but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other beliefs , tolerant and show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as I recently told a head of the police in the Washington , DC area recently , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it starts online . as a first person , the person is cut off from their church , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ sc@@ ab@@ ed their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming to Islam be a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as mus@@ li@@ in , as a mother , as a man , I think we must do anything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would be able to add them into their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you cast a look at it , it is not driving them what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she was silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , she would only bring them into trouble .
nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts , who spoke one solution .
this Ima@@ m created the connection to God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using it for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque she kept her to join the IS .
it was an understanding of how the Islam@@ ophobia lead me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear every day affect our democracy to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudices .
a study reveals : if you have examined Test@@ ing messages in which negative about Muslims , they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood for Muslims left upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ ency periods .
so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to be the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling with Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ mark .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear turns to all of us .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ ously man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a young man from my bro@@ therhood ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apt , as he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page .
he gre@@ ets eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we went to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we said it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exert our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , drew my shoes out , went into prayer @-@ all , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked his thanks and welcomed our guests , for half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but around us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you join with those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks lovely !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a ner@@ v .
but I wonder what can you say to those who may possibly claim that you &apos;re holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depression , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you are not . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when we look at Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever done study to Muslims throughout the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if humans like an exception to the rule , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . this is done in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ parcel has penetr@@ ated into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting inter@@ connecting air @-@ devices high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up self @-@ constantly re@@ movable structures .
you have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively aware where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a member of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands can be applied at the highest level . e.g. &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other starter drives , it is efficient in advance @-@ climbing , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great benefits at start and landing , and is highly versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a limitation of fla@@ x is that they respond to turbul@@ ence as wind@@ ow@@ ards .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the plane machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the cause .
such a question would be like this : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known , which can be joined to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly away dri@@ ve@@ yor , which had only two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ ago we discovered that flies with just one work .
this is the mon@@ tory , the mechanical easiest remot@@ ely used airplane . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further pitches or controls , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the interior live a lot , so that it can fly stable and move around in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the ta@@ gion . to put it to fly , I must throw it right .
the probability to throw it right if everyone watch , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ o is a exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the om@@ os@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is especially symm@@ etrical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
thereby he receives the inherent ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is filmed or even as it ro@@ uted .
it is of course complex , mainly in the area of the interactive flu@@ kes of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ans .
some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly from flying .
let &apos;s see this again .
when flying machines should once part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller @-@ machines .
this turns on clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ rant .
however , a bit sho@@ f -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allow a range of aesthetic expression .
we took non @-@ resident micro @-@ quad@@ rant -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine @-@ glands would like to take a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the reward lies in the development and production of the work .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy two black holes ever faster , they turned into pure energy as the mass tri@@ pled in one ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment they brigh@@ tened it bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time fabric , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
arrange the events first time a time .
1.3 billion years ago there have been several cel@@ i@@ ous life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rs , humans and -- God get to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was particularly courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that arise approximately through col@@ li@@ ating black holes .
most thought they were crazy .
but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ HT : the laser @-@ interfer@@ om@@ eters - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observatory .
in the following time , the precision of LIG@@ O could significantly increase , which improved recognition performance enormously .
therefore , it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O has started for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes are through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting of my To@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all this what I had worked , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist . he studied these 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ cus in the fabric of space and time .
while passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched towards one direction and to the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and st@@ aking , stretching and storage . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on 14th September , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched out the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um , one explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are in@@ geni@@ ous and with the support of the public every obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : face @-@ lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite handy . because you can make an image or a map of things by watching the light from multiple points coming in the light around you .
with sounds , that is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you :
the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind .
&quot; now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now speaks Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave patterns in sound , we can listen to the universe literally .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has long been busy .
S@@ H : two black , not three holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circul@@ atory with an additional audio @-@ change . this sounds like a Wu @-@ Wu Wu Wu on the Wu !
it is a type of movement , engra@@ ined in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I have to be forgotten -- heard this : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ &#93; sound &#93; Yemen and , who knows what he has to listen , sees this as sound noise of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which are turning around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
therein lies the ab@@ iding meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to discover the style as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see .
a super nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ting stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus , which is hidden behind the thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never go through , because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the pri@@ est@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the rest , but we will never see it because the jungle is vei@@ led by his own reflection .
using the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before , which we will never see , and of whom we have no idea , which we only discover by going to listen .
in fact , LIG@@ O was immediately found in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this issue : Me : the kind of stars , the black holes , how LIG@@ O they observed are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ zzle for our arche@@ ological work .
LIG@@ HT allows us to completely different points of view of the events in space , on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than the Big Bang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a year long , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , in uncomfortable situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the swing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I was afraid of removing my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , that changed my life deeply into an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is called all &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my be@@ ck@@ bill . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I wor@@ e me to always play with them once you ask myself . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am ti@@ ring me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a striking side effect : only recently , I understood the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ string to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dre@@ aming job .
I am author . I am reminded of things , awakened you to live .
dre@@ am@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I con@@ cre@@ ire TV . I make TV .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days times four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , four television programs , three pairs of television , three episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday night on Thursday night .
all over the world my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created , and not only produced so far . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world burn .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , therefore , I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author . &quot;
I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company or a classroom , a shop or a household , so you can understand that I am not only walking on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say , I understand that it does not dream at a dre@@ am@@ job .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am gone into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land from nothing .
it &apos;s when I put troops as painted I on a canvas .
so , you have a high note , lying a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , sound@@ ly and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the buzz .
there is such a change in me if the work is going well .
a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz stops like a busy road , I could drive for ever on .
many people assume that I &apos;m giving them the buzz that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing me pleasure .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the buzz -- when I began working with TV production , when I began working and working , building and working , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the buzz !
the buzz is more than writing .
the amount of money is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the money is music . the buzz is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a buzz , then you can not achieve any other way than size .
the feeling of trying not differently than to strive to size , no matter what price .
this is what you call the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic to be .
maybe it is a genius .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for failure , and I know only that I love the buzz .
I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear answer : the more successful I will , the more ship@@ ments , the more detailed boundaries , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the land , which I s@@ monkey , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz .
I like this sums . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this buzz ?
and then the buzz stops .
revised , exagger@@ ate , exaggerated , burned .
the buzz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the buzz stopped .
the amount of the engine decreased .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the money did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , accomplished weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a tit@@ le@@ ft not , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
so what do you do if what you do is doing the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ ps you from , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you are doing what you are doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ kers to be a mother , a banker who knows the buzz , and know how the buzz feels when you know the buzz , if the buzz stops , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out there , too late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , sk@@ inn@@ y you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she called me not &quot; estimate . &quot;
it calls no one more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when is that happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my tot@@ ality , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters also encounter a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of the frame , I can do nothing except adjust .
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am sil@@ ently .
the land , which I s@@ monkey , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay - they no longer exist .
all that exists sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax @-@ pins and the song in which it &apos;s going to release , or whatever the girl let in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solving .
a mental door goes in and a energy ub comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly returned .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s soft , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the buzz , but a buzz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the buzz , the working environment , the tit@@ anium @-@ h@@ um , this is just the replacement .
when I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m describing my brain by shows and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz is .
the money is not a force and it is not a job .
it is dependent on joy .
the real buzz depends on the love .
the buzz is the river that comes from the desire of life .
the real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of history , the tasks to perform , the expectation and pressure .
the real buzz is simple and original .
the real sums of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a tit@@ anium ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make this a permanent rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to listen to the buzz .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good at playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t have to play in a way like working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace as a home .
this entrance is painful , because what kind of man is working rather than being at home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan , &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we live in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and playing ball .
we de@@ bur@@ se soap bub@@ bles .
thereby I feel mostly sti@@ ff , present and confused .
I always ask for my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe filled me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we left with the games ?
you can also say it ! always tell them if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you stick to na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child takes you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes at the most , until they want them to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I replaced a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or Ke@@ ks .
and talking my teen@@ ager &apos;s daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
anyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are praying .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is true to have the buzz to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy ,
around the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and preserve it .
I am not perfect at it . I feel and I victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands shortly for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more .
15 minutes in the play , why not give full 15 minutes away ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return when I am not working .
working works not without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear the unknown melody , it fulfil@@ s me and my soul . it brings me to new ideas . I use it in full and love my work again .
I like the buzz , but I love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the buzz , the buzz is not me ... no more .
soap and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the buzz of love .
the amount of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful .
it is great to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and still I have everything under control . my brain is even more functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the more happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land , which I do , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz of life .
the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , dre@@ ad , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I awake you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks lovely .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a ab@@ iding , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ nel stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons such that the neurological function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Lie@@ der@@ tin and worked night and night in an emergency .
often I gave patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in the sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma , the brain is che@@ ered and incl@@ ined to the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure .
to save life , one has to l@@ essen the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure .
therefore , sometimes you have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells from this tissue grow .
this is not an easy task .
let cells of one tissue share are comparable with quite small children that are taken out of your families .
one needs to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed to work Jean @-@ François .
that was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you still know from Bi@@ ologi@@ an lessons that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche des brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they were slow and after a couple of weeks they were killed even .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large hir@@ te@@ e@@ al cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing .
this was what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area , and then to cultivate the cells as they did in Jean @-@ François .
and they then mark them in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ planted them at the Ent@@ ran@@ ged of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ sl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ pl@@ ore these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in bra@@ zed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they won &apos;t be taken there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we set an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we paint in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
thus we tra@@ ded monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pel@@ lets from a tray .
this made them very good .
when they had reached a stable course of skill , we last in the mot@@ orized cor@@ tex the hand unit .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they recover spontaneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate with the help of sculp@@ tural bra@@ in@@ eries . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous retreat , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same eighth , two months after the ad@@ plantation .
I can tell you , that was very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use them .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Parkinson &apos;s .
but our dream still is to im@@ planted them with man .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you &apos;re continuing to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them of course .
we do not see democracy as a fragile plant that is in reality but as invent@@ ories of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ant@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large im@@ itation in Beijing have doub@@ t@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ ra@@ ving friends , who would say to me that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if anything would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to re@@ think that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are being painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain ,
but only a few recognize their Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income in which you could carry the debt recovery and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , in England and in the euro area , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , as it compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , p@@ lows at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which is not the same due to the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low total economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus Father , which could not invest in which they would not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus Father , who would not invest in it , that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ wanted the circumstances causes it to cause that o@@ edi@@ pus ca@@ k@@ ills him .
this is my hairy with capitalism --
his extremely wasted art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles are defined as the social form , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy certainly closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be an error , the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these out@@ crop .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it concerned the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech , but more important and decisive , which they assigned to them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal mood in issues of the state .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
as a candle , which lit very bright , it is also quickly burned down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our current liberal democracies have their roots in the ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
liberal democracy came into action as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process was drawn to politics , while the economy - so , the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone was established .
in our present democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ ent struggle between the two by the economy gradually emig@@ rated politics and depri@@ ves them .
do you wonder why politicians can no longer be as they did before ?
it is not in the de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today , and still do not believe in the power because the power of politics is lost in the economy and are separated into the areas .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in such a way a herd of rob@@ bery , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which she is nour@@ ished , that she is star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy , which has worsen@@ ed the politics as far as the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the economic demand falls , and the managing director of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful the capitalism exp@@ elled the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the wealth of human beings .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retain control so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is one solution : the working poor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ power@@ fully with automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher the twin , the waste of wast@@ ing , and social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to restruc@@ ture the economy and re @-@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and to ensure that we are more democratic , otherwise we are in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that shows the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or by something that will serve the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving the humans , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it look like could it look , these &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in a nut@@ shell , some examples name .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market where you earned money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all incomes come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and workers who work there , but the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately not an exclusive f@@ ending .
in the field of global political economy , please find out that our national currencies had a free tail exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest threshold countries &#93; in the interest of the entire humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the country to a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that these funds are invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technology , particularly in parts of the world in which capital resources are scarce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we can decide together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography even as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is referred to as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we do it up to date , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is correct , Marx is certainly relevant ,
similarly as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally wir@@ elessly .
BG : indeed , and now we are probably too .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ elessly , one does not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your talk mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most people play , -- the area of the economy -- a totally democratic free zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , it resembles China today from the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now , China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of a tremendous amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the com@@ plac@@ ency and the perpet@@ ual denial that a massive shift line by the euro area ran , and continues to massi@@ vely threat the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal - by the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial .
unfortunately it is true . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , still have chosen the denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you are trying to obtain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will be possible to delay a while , but when the change occurs , he is going to be ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as an Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or anyone , who has been in office after 6 months , particularly in such a tense situation , he did not make any mistakes , then that &apos;s a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed there was an honest interest in the creditors &apos; pages to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the upheav@@ als made by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to conce@@ de that they have been a catastrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither from the Troika of the don@@ ors who has imposed us this policy , and one : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive test of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not out@@ going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the us@@ ur@@ ers will be suspi@@ cious , and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone but for the world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of Roy has never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably even for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is head @-@ appointed operator at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a bank@@ ment and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are at the right side of this bend .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b &apos;s website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after getting a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not matter to fall on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ estimate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time Amazon as something makes , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he requires guaranteed success , so he will keep a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where they can look at any free of charge .
and if Amazon exists nothing out of all things , it is not possible to get right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they will be observed while watching these shows .
you will be watching by Roy and his team to record everything .
you understand when you start the show , when one pause , which parts one can jump or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should be producing .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actor .
when they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this bend . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ vers@@ ed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years on statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optimize it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis did not work so , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we live in a time that we intervene more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone know the company multi @-@ Health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health system is a software company and I hope no one gets in touch with this software ever in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if anyone here in the US is in prison and asked to dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in jail are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results created . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data .
even the data @-@ vers@@ ed companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that it through data analysis erup@@ tions of flu , the di@@ vi@@ ous kind , can pre@@ dict -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year round year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data @-@ vers@@ ed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data records in the decisions of life - at the workplace , in the regulation , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions as to how to make decisions for a cancer treatment
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
you have to solve a complex problem ever , do the most of two things :
as a first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a wide @-@ wide , you set up the components together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : please take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to sit back together , even if the information is incomplete , to then hold a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
that is why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their public what they otherwise would not have been able to do . however , the decision to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they selected TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better choices , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it gave data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will get it later with a democratic demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the after@@ ward of the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little bit of external , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic building .
thus , the ball becomes wis@@ er and cl@@ ü@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks .
for in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks lovely .
