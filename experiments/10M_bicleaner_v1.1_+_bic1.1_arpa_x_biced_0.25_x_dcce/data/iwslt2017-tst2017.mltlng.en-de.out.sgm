<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before any one heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA have illegally abed by phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence service in which the CIA is literally exaggerating Iran into an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and called on him to call on its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and to head journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional Review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the people they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government at Risen ankle, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though it claims for years that it would be crucial in their case, the demands of the government of Risen were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and cracking statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have been kept secret, without his permission, his telephony secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even travel documents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA Whistleblower and Risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers with his lawyer. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all the U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government moves too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set off the press work, which should be protected by the first constitutional request, because the government has more possibilities to spying all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology is allowed to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which has not yet been written as an Risen book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source supervisor system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news web site, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that has access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to us to make sure that not only technology providers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility of making misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">The about mishes in the supply of soldiers modest and will report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental collaborator, the alarm to contaminated water of Flint suggests. or a wall street insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to impose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of the story was released.] [the 'Panama Papers' revealing that rikes and mighty] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness around an explanation.] this week we have been resident of messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, such as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad attacks in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's plantations, famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people there and others who are nervous to wait for the next release, and for the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agency owner or a John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we take?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world discussion media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, can be used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjoschkapscrib.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans that have occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to create a company as a reference note.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to zoom especially appealing investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 AnwaltsCompanies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring about money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocking it that all proposals made up to a lawyer by our investigator, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-preconditions. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course there was no money given to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who made suggestions submitted to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top political, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever be changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when borrowed optimist, I really see that there is quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last couple of years we have seen breaches to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU seized on a national level at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind shakers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy to stand up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who know the problem and use it to stop through laws this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the intransparency that will now end this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">That is the story, as I had almost been kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazowling.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I completed my design study, I made a rear-farm sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">One type of the red Mazda stayed there and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip all over the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep for tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he certainly says he would go to peace-house, but I don't know if he really is planning it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Macedar!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how to?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of alienating in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, shut up my toes at the door, and shut my bedroom door shut.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me today is hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my views completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold me in their childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Living on my air mattresses, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time-jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow-roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I survived how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham's tines is completely different, because we did it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we had passed our last guest and the door came into the lock, strong, Brian and I sat down.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time, and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make of it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the Investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can also invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one pointed out to the things that one can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we claim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your barren cell phone to your left side.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic, you now feel -- -- is exactly what they feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the sperous cell phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the sense of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for that reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once so, who now has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that it is backed by president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return your phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">Now you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced to his name; if he had told him where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 evaluations, all say: "he can really have very well-wrapped phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when your mobile phone would have to leave?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system reinforces confidence is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we were doing some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to submit negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their evaluations before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how most likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call to a person -- in our case by evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation can be common.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, for example, "hi!" you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "it tells you how, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother --" "" "-- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your home! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can one create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned, the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people do our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was not met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to devastated parties or have apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to be in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million nights had only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it may be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one life, even though they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a hospital in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they get books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even longer stay longer without saving the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay is starting.</seg>
<seg id="223">But those relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply to call" "" "lease" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of it open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is compared with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place to visit, a group there would be waiting to fill a group there, to fill a thoroughly and to show one at a bar pentine quarters that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would build apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people who were moved out of their children. incubators have been launched.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. our platform alone will host 785 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger, or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must think every time on when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or repressed, a brain-washing, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media is the people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee house -- double espresso, with cream.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteer-Fitness-fanatists,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual musliin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met my decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as a musliin. I chose the Hijab to wear my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why oppressed you yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The contend was: at that time it was a feminist statement of independence, and it was true to me that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm takes me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I see myself in it myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that somebody perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "I later had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had dinner too late, looked at the screen and saw the word "issuance."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people splitting from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard: "Muslim terrorists"...,... "in the name of Islam..."... "..." jihad... "...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked but in the Nu converted me the actions of others of a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to go to a new city and start studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we headed -- as we headed -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, the said: 'be watchful, "" Stay in well-lighted areas, "" Versammmed you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that one held for Muslims and smiled into the outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandants on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have lowered the anger of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only puts the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be seen as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, creators and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may stop some parking spaces but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other beliefs, tolerant and show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I recently told a head of the police in the Washington, DC area recently, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has found that it starts online. as a first person, the person is cut off from their church, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abscabed their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming to Islam be a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As musliin, as a mother, as a man, I think we must do anything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would be able to add them into their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology to their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you cast a look at it, it is not driving them what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she was silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalisation by extremists, who spoke one solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam created the connection to God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing it for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an understanding of how the Islamophobia lead me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear every day affect our democracy to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you have examined Testing messages in which negative about Muslims, they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood for Muslims left upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two constituency periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So "" "" "" "therefore, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it." ""</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to be the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling with Muslims is an early Warnmark.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear turns to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not just about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generously man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his life. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my brotherhood?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apt, as he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He greets eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we went to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We said it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes out, went into prayer-all, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked his thanks and welcomed our guests, for half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come to attack us, but around us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join with those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks lovely!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have taken a nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what can you say to those who may possibly claim that you're holding an TEDTalk, a thinker with depression, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you are not. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When we look at Muslims around the world, and I did it with the greatest ever done study to Muslims throughout the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans like an exception to the rule, then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for crafting, is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. this is done in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcel has penetrated into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting interconnecting air-devices high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-constantly removable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it must be collectively aware where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a member of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be applied at the highest level. e.g. "and" land. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter drives, it is efficient in advance-climbing, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great benefits at start and landing, and is highly versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of flax is that they respond to turbulence as windowards.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the plane machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be like this: what is the petty-possible number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are about as machines with a thousand movable parts known, which can be joined to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly away driveyor, which had only two mobile parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unago we discovered that flies with just one work.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the montory, the mechanical easiest remotely used airplane. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further pitches or controls, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the interior live a lot, so that it can fly stable and move around in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tagion. to put it to fly, I must throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right if everyone watch, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the mono is a exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the omoscopter with its eight propellors, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is especially symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the inherent ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is filmed or even as it routed.</seg>
<seg id="448">It is of course complex, mainly in the area of the interactive flukes of the eight propellans.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this again.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should once part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propeller-machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they act like a high-performance quadrant.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit shof -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allow a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took non-resident micro-quadrant -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine-glands would like to take a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward lies in the development and production of the work.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago encircled in a very far distant galaxy two black holes ever faster, they turned into pure energy as the mass tripled in one tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brightened it brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time fabric, and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events first time a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there have been several celious life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurs, humans and -- God get to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves that arise approximately through colliating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized it as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGHT: the laser-interferometers - gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increase, which improved recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO has started for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliating black holes are through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my Todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist. he studied these 23 years of gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crocus in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched towards one direction and to the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses on the relativity-theory often lead a really albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and staking, stretching and storage."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14th September, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched out the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are ingenious and with the support of the public every obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: face-lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because you can make an image or a map of things by watching the light from multiple points coming in the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now" "" "" "now speaks Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"swimmers Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns in sound, we can listen to the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has long been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not three holes, circulate simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circulatory with an additional audio-change. this sounds like a Wu-Wu Wu Wu on the Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement, engrained in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I have to be forgotten -- heard this: [Surren] sound] Yemen and, who knows what he has to listen, sees this as sound noise of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which are turning around as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve around one hundred times a second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to discover the style as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super nova, for example. I would like to know why masserting stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind the thousand kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the priestall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the rest, but we will never see it because the jungle is veiled by his own reflection.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using the gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before, which we will never see, and of whom we have no idea, which we only discover by going to listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO was immediately found in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this issue: Me: the kind of stars, the black holes, how LIGO they observed are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sauerknozzle for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGHT allows us to completely different points of view of the events in space, on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "a year long, I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, in uncomfortable situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I was afraid of removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, that changed my life deeply into an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, is called all "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimating, I need milk for my beckbill."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I wore me to always play with them once you ask myself. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am tiring me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side effect: only recently, I understood the "yes" -string to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dreaming job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I am reminded of things, awakened you to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I concreire TV. I make TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days times four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, four television programs, three pairs of television, three episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday night on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created, and not only produced so far. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore, I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you're talking about a company or a classroom, a shop or a household, so you can understand that I am not only walking on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say, I understand that it does not dream at a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am gone into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I put troops as painted I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So, you have a high note, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, soundly and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz stops like a busy road, I could drive for ever on.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that I'm giving them the buzz that I'm talking about writing that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with TV production, when I began working and working, building and working, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The amount of money is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can not achieve any other way than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of trying not differently than to strive to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for failure, and I know only that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear answer: the more successful I will, the more shipments, the more detailed boundaries, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I smonkey, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerate, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimating, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The amount of the engine decreased.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, accomplished weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titleft not, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is doing the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "grasps you from, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you are doing what you are doing to be a teacher, a bankers to be a mother, a banker who knows the buzz, and know how the buzz feels when you know the buzz, if the buzz stops, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out there, too late and she says:" "" "Mama, skinny you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me not "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no one more "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my totality, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom," "" "you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters also encounter a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of the frame, I can do nothing except adjust.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silently.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I smonkey, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax-pins and the song in which it's going to release, or whatever the girl let in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes in and a energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly returned.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's soft, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium-hum, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">When I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm describing my brain by shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not a force and it is not a job.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the river that comes from the desire of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of history, the tasks to perform, the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a permanent rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to listen to the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't have to play in a way like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entrance is painful, because what kind of man is working rather than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We live in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and playing ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We deburse soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel mostly stiff, present and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe filled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we left with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always tell them if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stick to naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child takes you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes at the most, until they want them to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced a Marienkins or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenager's daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Anyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are praying.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is true to have the buzz to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect at it. I feel and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands shortly for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to excel myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the play, why not give full 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working works not without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens up, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear the unknown melody, it fulfils me and my soul. it brings me to new ideas. I use it in full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The amount of work is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is great to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And still I have everything under control. my brain is even more functional. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I do, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dread, naked and new feeling of living in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks lovely.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a abiding, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most well known, the "Tiefennel stimulation." thereby, one implanted a electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons such that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Liedertin and worked night and night in an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I gave patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in the skull-brain trauma, the brain is cheered and inclined to the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to lessen the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Therefore, sometimes you have to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells from this tissue grow.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells of one tissue share are comparable with quite small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One needs to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed to work Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from Biologian lessons that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche des brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a couple of weeks they were killed even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large hirteeal cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area, and then to cultivate the cells as they did in Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark them in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we replanted them at the Entranged of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotranslant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplore these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in brazed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we replanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they won't be taken there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we set an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">Thus we traded monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable course of skill, we last in the motorized cortex the hand unit.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recover spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recuperate with the help of sculptural braineries. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous retreat, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same eighth, two months after the adplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that was very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implanted them with man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who may need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you're continuing to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it's useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as a fragile plant that is in reality but as inventories of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging antness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his large imitation in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, the democracy comes with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unraving friends, who would say to me that democracy would be abolished, if anything would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to rethink that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are being painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin" "" "paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize their Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income in which you could carry the debt recovery and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States, in England and in the euro area, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, as it compares with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, plows at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"" "" "" "thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which is not the same due to the usual market mechanisms." ""</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low total economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus Father, which could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Oedipus Father, who would not invest in it, that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances causes it to cause that oedipus cakills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasted art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles are defined as the social form, in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy certainly closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be an error, the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these outcrop.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that it concerned the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech, but more important and decisive, which they assigned to them the right to political co-determination with equal mood in issues of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which lit very bright, it is also quickly burned down.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our current liberal democracies have their roots in the ancient Athens." ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">Liberal democracy came into action as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process was drawn to politics, while the economy - so, the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone was established.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacent struggle between the two by the economy gradually emigrated politics and deprives them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians can no longer be as they did before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government today, and still do not believe in the power because the power of politics is lost in the economy and are separated into the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in such a way a herd of robbery, which so sustainably the animals, of which she is nourished, that she is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy, which has worsened the politics as far as the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the economic demand falls, and the managing director of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful the capitalism expelled the "demos" [the people] out of democracy the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the wealth of human beings.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retain control so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">"" "" "" "but there is one solution: the working poor!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-powerfully with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher the twin, the waste of wasting, and social conflicts deeper, just as it -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to restructure the economy and re-unite the areas of economy and politics, and to ensure that we are more democratic, otherwise we are in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that shows the film "matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix" or by something that will serve the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving the humans, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like could it look, these "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in a nutshell, some examples name.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine a capital market where you earned money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and workers who work there, but the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately not an exclusive fending.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please find out that our national currencies had a free tail exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest threshold countries] in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call it" "" "Cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the country to a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that these funds are invested in" "" "green" "" "technology, particularly in parts of the world in which capital resources are scarce." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is at the same time liberated, in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesianese, global keynesians.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography even as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand that Larry Summers is referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we do it up to date, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is certainly relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Similarly as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally wirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are probably too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirelessly, one does not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your talk mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most people play, -- the area of the economy -- a totally democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say this provocative, it resembles China today from the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now, China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of a tremendous amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and the perpetual denial that a massive shift line by the euro area ran, and continues to massively threat the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal - by the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it is true. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, still have chosen the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you are trying to obtain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, it will be possible to delay a while, but when the change occurs, he is going to be abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as an Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or anyone, who has been in office after 6 months, particularly in such a tense situation, he did not make any mistakes, then that's a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>

<seg id="1023">They didn't want to concede that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of Roy has never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably even for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is head-appointed operator at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a bankment and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are at the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb's website. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after getting a season, your brain asks, "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not matter to fall on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to underestimate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean exploiters, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time Amazon as something makes, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he will keep a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where they can look at any free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists nothing out of all things, it is not possible to get right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they will be observed while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watching by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You understand when you start the show, when one pause, which parts one can jump or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should be producing.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican U.S. Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this bend. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data-versed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis did not work so, this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time that we intervene more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company multi-Health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health system is a software company and I hope no one gets in touch with this software ever in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone here in the US is in prison and asked to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in jail are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results created. this is not because a company like multi-Health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data-versed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that it through data analysis eruptions of flu, the divious kind, can predict -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year round year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the vocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data-versed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data records in the decisions of life - at the workplace, in the regulation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions as to how to make decisions for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve a complex problem ever, do the most of two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a wide-wide, you set up the components together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: please take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to sit back together, even if the information is incomplete, to then hold a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their public what they otherwise would not have been able to do. however, the decision to put all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they selected TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better choices, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it gave data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most probably," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with a democratic demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the afterward of the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little bit of external, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus, the ball becomes wiser and clüer and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks lovely.</seg>
