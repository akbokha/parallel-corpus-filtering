Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the in@@ vigor@@ ous cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not currently up to date .
this knows everyone who had to make himself upright , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a byp@@ assing road showed a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of oste@@ opor@@ t@@ als in Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very conclu@@ sive .
especially when you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury in the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one does not recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets , were incorporated .
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Staat@@ measurable administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump out of the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ ation trans@@ eg@@ es with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns commissioned - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops reloc@@ ated with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : the present neighbors , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drive forward the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like everything else on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ isches Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of E@@ arly / Today is the most striking example of the state capital .
the city expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the map of the map , so 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ mines in 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ in written fl@@ yers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots today occupy no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ser of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land of Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of the Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ rooms of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century indeed a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ pos@@ tions@@ blatt , one read in the area of today &apos;s District Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; at the &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the Andes @-@ height &quot; On the air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the e@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , there are once people with ins@@ cription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich &apos;s district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden took up the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ hing of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he is forbidden to use the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who occupied himself an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients first was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ r@@ ists in Germany .
the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order now acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a teen@@ ager with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; was erected in architectural appearance at the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed at 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group released tours for Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ souri due to discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Ass@@ istance of the Federal State Mis@@ souri , which will take special attention until 28 August 2017 , while travelling by the state would take special attention and vo@@ iced the first caution , since a number of frag@@ mentary , r@@ ative incidents in recent times occur in the whole state and displayed here , &quot; says it in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recent law of Mis@@ souri which makes it hard to gain discrimination , and pro@@ enforcement bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the journey , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights that people happen .
they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin colour , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group &apos;s incidents like rac@@ ist Ver@@ sions against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders , under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and taken by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without having been accused of a crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the general state @-@ owned by Mis@@ souri in which black motor@@ ists in the state can hold 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring chew@@ ing , or let those relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri signed 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crimes reporting program of the F@@ BI , which entered the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th position of the country .
the trip warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it harder to res@@ ign a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Rights Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) commen@@ cement travel statements for Texas and Arizona , after countries adopted immigration laws , ple@@ dge the local law enforcement authorities to ple@@ dge people because of immigration law , which in view of the AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further racial pro@@ pul@@ sion .
the commen@@ cement of travel are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Pre@@ dec@@ aun@@ project is elementary
the fisher@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ ench@@ ant project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag : Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have seen a picture on the spot .
at the Sp@@ dig@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bacher CD@@ U plac@@ ands met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk @-@ kis@@ ses and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ milk &quot; is for him the alternative market @-@ market away for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ales .
as it is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ bach &apos;s fishing , he described the course &apos;s res@@ ale project as an elem@@ ental . &quot;
I cannot produce in such steep areas not profitable .
the green surface for much work , much has to be edited using the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ med operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even though he does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the meaning of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jungle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is glad about the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers must be supported .
one hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the plots could be drawn up quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they put their business &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the area of this area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ged until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the overall costs in the amount of 71 500 euros , half of the Leader is promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , farmers love to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences &apos; , stated Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women .
even for Peter We@@ wh@@ ites stood firm : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape E@@ cology ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of past@@ ure @-@ brown .
the aim is the unvei@@ ling of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the PR @-@ marked conve@@ ys .
in addition , the ten@@ uous area may not be in@@ pper@@ able ( H@@ ang@@ tz@@ es about 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
for the fisher@@ y Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ project 2018 , the application is currently running for eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build approximately 16 kilometres of Zau@@ n .
the area of the area of 35 hectares , the kal@@ ine costs are at more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty before
the safest sign of a regime change is when they start to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the sor@@ eness staged in Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the president for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller does not reach the statue yourself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have cur@@ led him if he would have done it .
but he laid their significance , and in particular the importance that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta described : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a full thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem upon which you refer , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly right , but as he re@@ formed itself , it does not really matter of history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your nat@@ ured , your poor , / your op@@ pressive masses who long for themselves to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waste waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller Not committed himself to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : indeed , it is a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - did know very well that they have accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an un@@ used classical exposition .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ ac@@ tly - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this long time .
the great scre@@ am as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not in charge , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , that bring the American flame into the re@@ plen@@ ished world : &quot; lady Liberty goes forward .
it should carry the lamp of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and not a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they were inspired by the exhausted , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships has been seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to recognise .
their tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two guns belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship title &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we will try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy on the stre@@ et@@ corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was voted by the team for teamwork .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or they still live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ silver medal winner , which is at its fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 checks are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ stream Mu@@ ir goes on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season that included the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
she was reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the Mann@@ it@@ ts capit@@ ol said that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ er .
&quot; the special team captain in the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour to me , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me to make something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here to be established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech as a captain concerns ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home@@ support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;ll be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b not a public office if you cannot wear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of all , from home policy up to its political principles .
he cle@@ ars with criticism , safe .
but he did not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we will run like the sheep to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington .
ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Rights talks about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rod of the Govern@@ ors let the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a recipro@@ cal campaign with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the highest @-@ ranking approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful of using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ sty head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the Govern@@ ors page - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ ek Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the block@@ work of the comments was nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post office talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ iting .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
Ombud@@ sman Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not heat @-@ bot@@ tled but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; I comment@@ ated that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably mention others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a re@@ viewer or a negative comment will be deleted .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical leadership artic@@ els and to burn demonstrators or to silence demonstrators .
but that is exactly what happens right .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official when he critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is ch@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County de@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as she called a vot@@ er on their fac@@ ebook @-@ page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar impact as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence sm@@ ote his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping , with Great Britain , came to power , according to historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not sil@@ enced it .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and discourse belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort during the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ar organized the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the final crossing , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a studi@@ ous advocate of this game and proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels particularly useful , &quot; said the player found in South@@ port Player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open not to defend it last year after I had won them from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion at home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six holes in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by pas@@ si@@ vity
in the past two decades fewer people have died due to pas@@ si@@ pping of lung cancer .
the researchers of the University Hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates are due to 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases due to passive exposure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew a study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to pas@@ si@@ vity per year in Germany .
the new inquiry is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lies somewhat &quot; in time , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground is far superior , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which still impe@@ ded the construction work , represents a big problem for the b@@ aut@@ op@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists from red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the bus@@ buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting .
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina &apos;s De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , they do not use stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet ind@@ ones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally speci@@ fies a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the shortened tu@@ bers is taken with ze@@ al@@ ed , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ ism - it has no furniture - where it also performs its daily work , Z. B. dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ ch .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late can work too dangerous : most of the villagers are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody w@@ ailing it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was incorporated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia than only 1.@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ dest had to vote before the occupation forces .
an existing movement which stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , turned off quickly against the Jak@@ arta government that maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or jurisdictions of it .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s independent part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ brown , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated ro@@ oft@@ ops that have been converted by gro@@ ost in different yellow sounds .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , hon@@ ed Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and pointed to their lively , hand @-@ sour@@ ced tur@@ ban , their dark shirt , and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before we had only leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia in the poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ancy and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates of Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was built in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood &apos;s natural resources valued by 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this wealth is a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua for the Pap@@ ua , which make sure there is an em@@ powering military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port meets local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden G@@ ans and are merc@@ il@@ essly treated .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ 20 years were provided according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
the Indones@@ ian police held more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the region alone in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from 2016 , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and charges are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as any week may happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources have to bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , because Muslim business@@ rants can come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ines sell bro@@ iled chicken and g@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ ensis .
local people are struggling to participate here .
&quot; the migrants started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign to address inequalities and infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter won 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; You say You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep @-@ point for two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the start@@ led children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off their tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , drank , hun@@ ted , and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers threw into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of local police and the military commander to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ s@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some prot@@ esters began to drag bricks at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , soldiers got a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly became shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who was fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers who assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , as his c@@ ousin , the witness of sho@@ ots .
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans just one name , the TI@@ ME in gri@@ mmer mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters , that his officers said their station only , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .
the messages on the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i thought in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ amp@@ ant to address the historical dis@@ ables in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism to con@@ vul@@ ge historical human rights violations .
but the ex@@ porting began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a withdrawal when he talked with TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , all is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua said , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been inf@@ lic@@ ated , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I interviewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am frigh@@ tened to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that men in Pan@@ i@@ ai fears have to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten from the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday morning the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village residents and the manager of a building company , consecr@@ ated to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others have been wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk when he was fis@@ her in a nearby river died on the way to hospital .
performed vill@@ ager prot@@ ested before the business office of the company .
the police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted that they threw War@@ n@@ ap@@ shots .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and a killing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured here is quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself in my house two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to hold the officers involved to hold the police officers and to withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ ru@@ gated board for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensual development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal u@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ ear @-@ leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and is arbitrary , under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for locals too expensive .
bread is just as far as reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially a cle@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a bo@@ ast@@ ed only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time economic inequalities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua is rarely the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission of the films were given .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is campaigns were to raise the limitations of reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visa @-@ denial and a black list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the pre@@ condition of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , May@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and printed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia received another presidential election , but Pap@@ ua is saying that they will probably not be able to vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants that J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people knows that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military in the im@@ pover@@ ished education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Cast@@ ors led a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ ter : the body of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they cannot forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a en@@ ig@@ able head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai in its transit and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years through the floo@@ ding house , that is called Rand@@ li@@ ously the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got stuck at the fire @-@ raid and the scre@@ aming of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a inhabitants of his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dub@@ ais civilian protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cooler .
the government said it &apos;s working on providing accommodations for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in areas of skyscrapers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building according to its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damages from dis@@ guise , out@@ wear or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ded in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is consistent with his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting the support for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup individuals was still supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ sk@@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third @-@ majority .
although this is often very long , but that &apos;s why the Five @-@ sentence classics will remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore , was just under missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the assessments .
even after the vote did not only come before the proposal before the proposal came to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the first round .
to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements are facilitated at training places , etc . , and the players will be able to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US @-@ travelers bringing dre@@ aded items to the plane , finds a pol@@ l out
a survey among passengers discovered that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously noted items to the control points of the U.S. transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which occurred the plane , while they were accidentally deleted kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they would have late , that they were lost by fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - the Jet Char@@ ters Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travelers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respondents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they have attempted accidentally to fly with something that was prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were posted to T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent en@@ cor@@ es , know@@ ingly collect objects with blades carried by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 per cent of the female respondents and 3,@@ 7 per cent of the male respondents also confirmed that they would have inten@@ tionally brought drugs to the plane .
the company said it was interviewed travellers around the country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mug@@ gling were brought by the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mug@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - by safety , those were the most often flying .
however , the company points out that T@@ SA Guid@@ elines are a little complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which fluids are allowed to take them or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of objects covered by the T@@ SA are de@@ pl@@ ated fluids .
for a while the people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mug@@ gling .
fluids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customer order order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be pleased with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , he has so far under@@ beat that a part of the customers already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures to sales growth and more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k announced the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : one of the cancellations received in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k was often applied with more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .
now sp@@ ells Mus@@ k a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn .
critics were repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
in a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations prior to , sp@@ y Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that cancellation of so far is about twelve percent of all orders to be solved , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production site .
in the last year Tes@@ la has delivered 8@@ 4,000 cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 is supposed to - all models put together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
those who have ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected in the second half of the year 2018 by delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand @-@ new , still never tested in practice , without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum discharge .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot escape dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt res@@ igns from the rules of the Obama @-@ Era to reduce emissions back
one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authority , his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g caused air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a Federal State Court .
it is a deadline which ran out on 1 October for States in order to meet the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ down o@@ zone standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will be able to delay a year to give his authority more time to study the Plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions or to impe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma it was a reliable time to take severe environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly declined to block regulations and delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month a Federal Minister of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority as he tried to undertake the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reducing gu@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply struck the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the United States through the complex process of timely execution of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not comp@@ lied with the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who def@@ endant over the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and any other legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make sure the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month is to delay the implementation of the rules by 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
the New York Pro@@ state @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who had compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our cl@@ usal positions - is a major asset for the health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground o@@ zone arises , when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources can react in the atmosphere of sunlight .
the standing smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and every year contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists are che@@ ered about the course of the P@@ ru@@ itts change of course change .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to turn out on environmental contam@@ in@@ ers and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ble celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in turmoil on Sunday , 16th July , at 16.@@ 30 a.m. to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ b@@ ang @-@ Seren@@ ade can ench@@ ant itself from this powerful place .
saving and maintaining the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Ur@@ text book : Earl Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the main parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; by Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the judgment , according to the certificate of the certificate , the ri@@ ghtful mountain apart from the old parish church was also a glorious court toward which the church or the Pat@@ ron was right and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the sub @-@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ fication of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ - was born of the early medieval owner &apos;s law .
the Lord , who built a church , occupied and occupied with a pastor , remained to the owner of this church and was also able to bequ@@ e@@ ve that church .
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or propos@@ ing the bishop a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ ks at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell set then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window discs were introduced and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
overthrow of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger &apos;s Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the aid church broke down .
only the cherry @-@ storm allowed one to stand .
in the New Years , a storm took a storm the cherry and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only the tower of that still available Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em was working with the &quot; Schaff@@ ade &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ er organis@@ ers invite friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , on the sixth Seren@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
local , Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 PM .
to the sound of the Seren@@ ade , a trunk finds in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows up to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers out the fantastic view .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of significance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bes feel particularly committed to the care , as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
society wants to test permission of wind wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the landing council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines would have been approved , as at the time in qu@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal is a wind@@ force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone , but a exclusion of wind conditions for the rest of the municipal area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ locking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had previously decided a second wind @-@ centr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government was not approved by Düsseldorf , because of a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal conditions , the issued appro@@ vals is still illegal and therefore rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council approved again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been entered in the circle since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , it is not likely to lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday wanted to express its content in the argum@@ entation of the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , building four per 200 meters high wind wheels .
already last year , the company , in which the city of quadru@@ pe@@ es is involved , signed agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered - this represents around one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ quarters households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , four @-@ legged coun@@ cill@@ ors appeared in green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acking together : woman dies in a terrible accident
an aw@@ ful traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 am at the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ lo@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal to me .
two more people were easily injured .
the Landes@@ straße was locked over hours .
after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took charge of their passenger cars with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers schedule the home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ts and people from the region are expected to discover shops in the city center in September .
the business@@ men and the government authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping centre to the city centre .
as the president of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for the special city , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
the market is therefore planned a market with regional suppliers , similar to the market .
in addition , local companies are to present their apprentic@@ es .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at night shopping &quot; .
the action lies not only to residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed sach@@ et that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , says Christian King .
city administration and entrepreneurs have a co @-@ operation with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the business@@ men go and the city to another stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive Center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acc@@ tiv tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest along with all entrepreneurs and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the renoun@@ cement of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentially new or more are to be created again .
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the inner city at the shopping cart .
at the end everyone must contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - up to landlords , the farms of the whole city and associations .
it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly did some extent , had said to be king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , with the fact that on the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , the first five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities participate .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion under the lead management of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners is also making it clear that every citizen can influence its own character with its purchasing behavior .
two dead and several injured after blast to U.S. school
during construction , there came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new other people were wounded .
at a gas blast in the US city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been injured , some of them severely .
according to the fire@@ brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a vulnerable in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during an explosion .
a first mixed was also dead also dead .
among the dead , it was the employees of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we suspected the authorities work on a gas pipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only a few people were in the building of the &quot; haha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp set out after per@@ ched trans@@ cribed trans@@ cribed by phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription by telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp called on a phone at the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president compl@@ ained because he denoun@@ ced the Wall to denoun@@ ce , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s why you cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to erect a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first ons@@ lau@@ ght with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ , that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridiculous , &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence of the trade had been given to him as a &quot; land@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; land@@ p , &quot; after having suggested a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists conduct rac@@ ist mo@@ ist act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came forward with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates are in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ ly the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams rent the still@@ ness , when a young black man was crus@@ hed from the passenger seat .
thank@@ fully , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , was only a desc@@ endant .
but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; they are almost all in the audience very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of im@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a for@@ war@@ y on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old professor of Congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the position as a dram@@ ati@@ cal call to action and represents an annual reminder of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; we want pro@@ secu@@ tions , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get fairness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court medical practitioner puts a beg@@ ining about the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI &apos;s veins , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding religious ships were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but nobody ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on an open foot for decades , they say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Black citizens in Georgia for the first time to de@@ bar@@ ge their voice in the summer .
at about the same time as the election , according to particulars of the F@@ BI , Roger Mal@@ com , Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that ru@@ mor was in the city be that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she came to the prison away from prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounds the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , which has been prepared and arranged for the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes with a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement purposes , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and decei@@ ved the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more striking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a franchise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade of long C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual desc@@ endant of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her account is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is explained in a sort of deep racism that many people believe in America no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we will then be confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have been through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the bl@@ acks - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the leader of the leader of the leader , but he said the role would never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the nests b@@ cri@@ es and pressed him fur@@ ious , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ mus@@ sels the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs most lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos; n -- &apos; have said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ted one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and he shifts the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed men .
the scene begins again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with rep@@ ell@@ ation .
absolutely no one battle .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , clo@@ th@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads tri@@ via Holidays griev@@ ing lob@@ ster , &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators of sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as cru@@ ising when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tren@@ ches of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until that point , the mur@@ ders have remained a anec@@ d@@ ote but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ mon took place , the air is donated to it .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy as if he wants to remember it .
after some minutes he ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sil@@ l and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move that has played the C@@ lan@@ se .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aced two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms , crying the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for one reason . &quot;
later the audience is dealing with the actors for dinner .
chat@@ ting at a table a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the after@@ math of a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words that feeling the performance of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who like yourself and do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does this with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she called the only police @-@ shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks yard at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ war is in a way inspir@@ ational because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have not studied his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth

Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ ed further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted with .
the job @-@ building , announced by the Director of John Fall@@ on , primarily for 2018 , and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 places .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that has been hit by a fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month expressed his involvement in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged since it achie@@ ves an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide attack
a su@@ icide attack has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several others hurt , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were violated , shared a declaration of Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports repor@@ tedly died in the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato is it that occurred on Thursday evening , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a group of persons who were attacked . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are located and in the US military hospital at the air@@ field Bag@@ ram will be dealt with .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , who is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops in the nearby back@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civil deaths , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide bom@@ bed at least 30 people in a predomin@@ ate district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
on May 31 , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the killing milit@@ ant milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops reported the Taliban by the army .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering the number of US troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy , and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule after cl@@ usal positions
the American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries compl@@ ained the Agency because of the pac@@ em@@ aker .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so called &quot; O@@ zone Code 2015 &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , the O@@ zone regulations - in which to be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to specify where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , met on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the endeavor was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rep@@ el a wide range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which aims to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth .
however , the efforts have triggered the impact of the democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone incorpor@@ ates &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and increase the breathing symptoms , &quot; as for example asthma .
com@@ der@@ at wants common room
in the end the decision was clear : in two cases the similarities of the Flu@@ orn @-@ wind blows up the establishment of a common space in the future retirement capital .
before the discussion there is an important information : the buying contract for the still missing property part is signed , reports Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it will still take until the present church belonging to the Church is owned by the church , but there is now no planning of planning for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion about a communal space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an average of 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council so@@ ars such a common room , not as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the community .
as an example made the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision by providing funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided in the last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common space would be , so T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible .
the proposed resolution sees to signal the investor that in this respect they don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which lowers the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which lowers the speed and the construction of economic power - can be made possible .
need@@ less , so far not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this hint .
when it helps : in tune he is going to be the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which you can &apos;t move so right now , they are now looking at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks definitely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it also sees behind a covered sub@@ missions of any rate or foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give any allowance , but get a real , in doubt of the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
stadium request , to set up the proposal for the proposal , finds three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two counterparts at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ising : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to the res@@ in of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the national first &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to arise .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to the basic needs of many hard@@ ship visitors , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it compound nature , science , movement and sports performance .
members want to set up the scheduled route along the route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase till 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question Che@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , ho@@ ist and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
therefore at the location of thousands , a good mobile net reception plays a role .
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ring train should be extended by train .
&quot; at the star trail leads the viewer a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger lumin@@ aire than another , although it was essentially further away .
I will also place , in which constellation can find itself a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been running in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , at the highest located star of Northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park , according to information from the Federal Office of Natural Protection , is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy can be clearly seen with naked eye .
in the university city there has been on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium planet@@ arium , something similar to the planned star@@ vation - the planet planet .
beginning in front of Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads with its ri@@ mp@@ s up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as an extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( community equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ par@@ ted down@@ grade Plu@@ to at the end point - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters away the sun measures some 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planet distance is about four kilometers .
while the light of sun goes down to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians also need a good hour to get to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ star but would still take half a year .

I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko defend his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate as that a possible show@@ down between the fighters the &quot; perfect size &quot; would be .
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on weight @-@ weight .
and he has to move to light weight , &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to schedule the Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 Po@@ und Debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked about him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fighting champion of River@@ side see &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;

four injured after tire burst
during an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the onward transfer market probably after a tire shoe that will take control of his vehicle .
the passenger car dra@@ ined right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ looks and then stayed on the roof in the Grün@@ strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of North for about an hour , then traffic on the left lanes could be subject to the accident place .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 to the end of the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first season Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , as were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers to much , and we must adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge region the triangles should also be further optimised .
and a gate after a Fre@@ ist@@ o@@ ß want the Fort@@ ress also no longer cat@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will turn on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ ck@@ ette than with the four @-@ t@@ wee@@ zers .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says His Trainer Fried@@ ong Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is to be sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just begun to build half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , but that we are even better to harmon@@ ise and we do not afford as many play@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ used start , doesn &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance might well be okay . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we are standing on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
of that , his trainers wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the season assessed only six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helmet Fun@@ kel , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken shortly because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a hom@@ el@@ ude , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann that players from Au@@ e may even be some fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an ascension cra@@ ving in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % wherever they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhein@@ land are going to be an easy favourite on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are swe@@ pt away , just because we are entitled to come under the first sections , is ble@@ mis@@ chie@@ vous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is only positive in a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the outset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ unas &apos;s Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and over@@ flowing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this way , Fun@@ kel does not want to experience its players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ sharing tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzles ) has started conducting tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be more precise during the asylum seeker of the age after the Swedish migration authority ( migration risk ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees , the under@@ ages were . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to the present day migration is disp@@ at@@ ched 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person may be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; possibly below 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been resistant to the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has been lied over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the person studied 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , she concluded that in the 243 of these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age evaluation , in the x @-@ ray recordings of wisdom @-@ teeth and MR@@ I shots of squ@@ abs are being analyzed , which then critic@@ ised by dentists and radi@@ ologist , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it surely we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the test : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is un@@ correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in that case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold lava , builders at the Department of road @-@ beings and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg .
in April the work started at the same time on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is confident that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
built it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure the stability of stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach &apos;s entrance now has on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ cken@@ cap .
this is a margin@@ alization that is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter width can be used on Friday .
then it should run the pedestrian road .
the special thing is that this is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge folders .
special finger@@ tips has necess@@ it@@ ated the wir@@ ing of lines by the construction works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there also runs a glass of fibre , which many firms are connected .
the inhabitants were informed beforehand about the project in advance of the work .
first of all , fish and cancer had to be removed .
for the bridges between the construction self @-@ building and the collection in Direc@@ tion Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic @-@ lane through a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is disabled .

the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so frequent that parties are pulling in a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which otherwise is difficult to get under a hat .
the party leader@@ ships ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that shows peacefully in this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Hall Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ invites to the poster of a great electoral campa@@ igning .
and known names to the start brings - such as Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top not@@ ch for the Bundest@@ ags on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the start of the event are not wanting to listen to the Af@@ for@@ ters , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city has been planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; age @-@ German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ak without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police declared many officials after Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D have actually reached Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ y volcano mountains , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first met in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because due to the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes , there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 8 pm , on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ pres@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ D @-@ Chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the leading can@@ did@@ acy for the Bundest@@ ags , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beatri@@ x from Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
unchanged is the police force , but so far the officials had a calm evening .
a little over one hour will take the A@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can back up - no special incidents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwarz@@ seas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ ties in European leaders .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is owned by the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to cross the borders on their instruments but also f@@ use the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new format , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folk music , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ ate N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and the free play to an intrigu@@ ing total artwork .
this core piece of the program was first performed by the success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ p@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their special acou@@ sti@@ cs will be consciously included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual sides
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stewart totally open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I once sit in gri@@ lled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh this was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ tic stars was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who eventually went up bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite all the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar . &quot; magazine : &quot; I &apos;ve been in love with anyone who I have posted .
or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , cr@@ ates gave up that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
so it has never been confused or disabled .
I never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them , they have suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time when they prefer to dress like a be@@ g : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me very badly .
when I eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to tell their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and that anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some call me as un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to be able to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening of a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised to be a major announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice could not be the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mines in five states and inherited a carbon business from his father .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening had a statement in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us from working towards our country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unified message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ ges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it wasn &apos;t the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tic World Championship that he was correct the exile of his country from the sport and that he was determined to combat the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress on the maintenance of the ban was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was found in state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that it has experienced some hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ ten Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championship that will start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria than neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
Dro@@ gging tests are still inadequate and bot@@ tled coaches are still working freely , he said repor@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral pact for in Mali mat@@ ted soldiers
at a funeral party in the North @-@ Northern Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have a helicop@@ ters in Mali Losinj soldiers thought .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the still un@@ explained di@@ lap@@ se , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she drew the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cham@@ ber@@ ner of her trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to have the highest sacrifice that they have undertaken in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday of a week in western African Mali .
its coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and transferred on Thursday by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr at the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day , only the relatives were at the church farewell .
then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
Trau@@ erg@@ es laid down on Roses , the relatives were arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense minister of the Le@@ yen awarded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sat@@ anic soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the batt@@ les@@ h@@ ub@@ by Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and have been one of the first six trained tiger pilot of its Regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the occupation could not turn off the crash , there would not have been missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen is not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance for a country by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral party the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are ad@@ o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data .
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by his wife after his death .
he shared the Royal House on Thursday with him .
traditionally , the Danish kingdom is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard have already made a coff@@ in ha@@ g for the two .
the queen was agreed with the decision of their man , it was further in the communication .
where prince Hen@@ rik will bury , be still unclear .
but he did not want the intention of being buried in his French home country .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a mistake from it , that he was not happy with his title .
after the hei@@ r of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have loved to reign .
in 2016 he went out and lays the title &quot; Princ@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he didn &apos;t see himself as equal to his wife - even after the death , L@@ ene Balle@@ by , the Princip@@ ality of the Danish Royal House .
where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately still unclear .
but he did not want the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country , for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sexes , had met Mar@@ gre@@ den in 1965 in London .
at the Thames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people has always postponed , the prince of Hen@@ rik had a serious stand with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ k@@ r@@ amps instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intelligent@@ sia , I could not hope for hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two errors ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants fast re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
low @-@ expert Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a quick re@@ election of the country &apos;s day , but does not want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her Land@@ tag fraction in Nieder@@ sachsen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the landing stage , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one @-@ voice majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ ires founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated it on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his faction to take them .
so that CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the ratio was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected Reg@@ ular on 14th January of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l considers it to be indispensable that the day of Parliament decides as quickly as possible to self @-@ redemption .
the CD@@ U Parli@@ ament@@ ary Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through their next actions .
the state @-@ Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament Day draws the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be tested legally clean &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss in peace all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called a twist step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something recur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was shown as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ duc@@ ts of parliament@@ arians to the return of their Land@@ sm@@ and@@ ats .
&quot; we of course assume that she has received her Land@@ tag , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; distributed the Landes@@ Officer Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she decided not to take no pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there was no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ head of the Lower Saxony @-@ Democratic El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green MPs in Nieder@@ sachsen is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the president of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the resignation of the Tw@@ ist costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its last van@@ ity and in their frustration their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony played this dirty intri@@ gue and try to strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political capital &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tional CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend to his Members to take El@@ ke T@@ ires to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the country election in 2013 .
at that time the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a bri@@ ghter majority from one voice in the country &apos;s day .
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ ists , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed over contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Agri@@ cultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer guard against poison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumer to watch the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the most recent information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis of crisis - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tened of the Federal Minister has not really been perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and since the announcement of Germany , it is in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just the same as the manufacturers make sure that the selling products are safe and hygien@@ ic .
if in eggs the back @-@ weight content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , these are not accessible .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the establishments to blame .
sit factories and consumers in the same boat ?
after the high level of knowledge , the manufacturing industry does not meet any immediate debt .
rather , they have to reck@@ on due to mut@@ in@@ ability of illegal practices of services enterprises with economic damage .
as always there is little control in the case of the case .
is it only missing on the staff or on the coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
however , the truth also implies that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded as 100 per cent .
precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already clearly stated many times that I expect a seamless education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer girls and consumers have the right to get solely safe and safe food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide used in the food industry , consumer rights and consumer are rightly outra@@ ged .
the pan@@ demic means are manufacturers , distributors and consumers in a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ tin@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ feeding animals is unacceptable and needs to be stopped immediately .
it has to be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect the competent authorities from all competent authorities , that the fact is being resolved quickly and incomplete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ har@@ dened issues of European football matches will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world @-@ record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain off the UEF@@ A as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules which have been launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G will eventually have to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million Euros ) paid to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that is to amount tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to France .
for sure , PS@@ G can make sure the money loose so N@@ ey@@ mar starts and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mist@@ ress of Qatar .
associations may address a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to control with legitimate objection , which will enable them to take advantage of the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ki@@ cked to ruin , when banks or owners res@@ igned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P focuses on the focus on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - has bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although PLA@@ ini 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ ann@@ in will continue to terri@@ fy from excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ fal@@ so , who is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out @-@ clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat @-@ scale , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal , so that the solution @-@ solution for the next five years can be exp@@ ired in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi that is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a budget of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the Mann@@ it@@ ans members will remain limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to over@@ list its financial supervision by making their revenue by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a vegetarian company can sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not have to be considered as legitimate income .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was b@@ lown by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be ambassador and a such man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators simply could be out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider each attempt to byp@@ ass the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ated on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of the anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ourism .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and tried to prevent n@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal , by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; co @-@ financed D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to the official owner of the PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al manager arsen@@ al Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations of La Liga against a state which financed a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord &apos;@@ chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now , the continued cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract new .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request the News@@ Agency SD@@ A report a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will hold a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ wel@@ ded Scho@@ ol@@ it@@ af@@ eln can distribute to 14 grams per year the aviation ladder against the passengers .
over the cost , Swiss does not want to provide any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sector in@@ sider value the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achie@@ ves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer , it is a prestigious contract .
like many applicants there are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the review , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty over the Spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer has not been reached for an opinion .
chocolate panels spread Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied co @-@ operation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablet .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss mainly carried out two and a half years with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
at long @-@ ride flights , customers of First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie J@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ ou@@ ches passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short @-@ route Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the N@@ ic
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ et@@ ch Com@@ edy , The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ated ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a franchise it feels like that the time would be tight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original history for promising D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by going on the g@@ ags of the g@@ ags - actor middle age plays dirty children who grow up - they nevertheless made the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the jo@@ kes .
&quot; ten years later , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering principle , including a reef to the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sw@@ ings the cradle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point wrote a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot that is involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , the prices are the best part of the franchise .
it is particularly fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons In@@ li@@ ppen@@ berger from &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the moments of random madness , which could show this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show until he finally achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last scene the gang will show how they visit the fil@@ mp@@ re@@ mi@@ ere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon meanwhile recalls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; by the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ match icon .
the Com@@ edy Gar@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives an found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the protagon@@ ist - a hard @-@ stain Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a specialist producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police spends the time playing chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which bears a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , that it is often like a single one .
with six long episodes it pul@@ ls out , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was reproduced on a reduced length could its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better supply , since Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who disappeared a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the coordinated communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for the fo@@ dder for a money .
the fic@@ tional @-@ Romanian creators are not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar county , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects as the pro@@ secutor of Con@@ stance on Friday morning .
15 alleg@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 years and 77 , and already issued arrest warran@@ t against this en@@ acted .
in addition , the officials placed bigger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros .
in the same razor in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
at the same time , Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators participated .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia is being accused of drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ bery and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even since the summer of 2016 the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office is determined against the organised drug trafficking in the South German region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in doing so , the examination of the investigations , above all , Italian nation@@ als with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also , when the incident took place on May 27 , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , should go to the bank account &apos;s account .
how to complain large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register in Germany indicates significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to partly grave failures with asylum methods .
the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen thus , has pointed out a media report according to large gaps in the aliens register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Register , it is estimated that ten million people are captured by foreign citizenship , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data was not adequately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long since become longer alive , or by citizens that have become a citizen of citizenship , and in the Register actually no longer should arise . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can significantly slow back processes , &quot; it says the report further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about travelling people , over EU citizens who have not had to travel out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false concessions led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with travelling &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government has obviously begun to return refugee families with less than 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they moved from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will emerge from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) reports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper there is therefore , the BAM@@ F guide such methods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible to see the newspaper as a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country travelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recep@@ tive capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy chose the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) hold this ple@@ dges for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU countries would also send back to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the non @-@ political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the lack of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child labour . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation led the speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 that interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and by 2018 to 1.@@ 6 % and warned that pressure on the bud@@ get@@ ary would continue , whereby inflation is expected to rise by almost 3 % in fall .
but it sign@@ alized that over the next few years interests would be necessary to bri@@ dle the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Recovery package that was issued before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for financial investment plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real@@ arrive of households continues to be charged for consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest of interest , it repe@@ ats that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain sentences of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently predicted the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that fatigue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May is projected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after this news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.3 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth increases the rising expectations on a zinc increase and GDP has risen in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of salary , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes even worse before it is getting better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income of income in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover at the end of its three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy will also be bol@@ stered by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound due to which a portion of lower consumer expenditure is compensated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the failure .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last ruling by the Bank to interest rates , the reputation was increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July caused a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will be resum@@ ed in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write a weak pound weight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ ore , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent decline of s@@ wap machines , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , since the credit card speakers are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive manner .
the market looks especially good for those in which the existing de@@ cks are out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to pres@@ cribe 10,000 people more controversial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment starting from September after a battle before the High Court against financing of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ approved preventive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can decrease the infection risk of some 86 percent , now by the health service provided by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the process after having confirmed the Court of Justice last year after that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the report announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of April 2018 .
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP has significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection types .
pre@@ EP before having intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are available to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or twice before intercourse .
to those who come for treatment in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study , including men , women , transfers and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a medical doctor can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the programme will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines in this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of the EP as clinical instructions are collected , as it is used in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to preventing HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted at the most vulnerable and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be made that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one that has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP reviews has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Schatten @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to monthly delays and hesit@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to end the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living great life : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment have turned into a generous homes
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house located in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their pockets .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometers large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a spar@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and a me@@ zz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she also commissioned das Archit@@ ect and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a me@@ zz@@ anine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan needed to think creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stun@@ ned to each other without we had to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine looks a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down across the glam@@ orous living area .
Ges@@ pie@@ go gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him go longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer secluded units space for all seating and glasses of yo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a glam@@ orous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a guard .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; it is un@@ important , so it is when you push the door very gently leads . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and one improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will arise and perform a calculation based on the ground floor . &quot;
they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love you into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of something very astonishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers are fighting for an amount of 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an examination of one of the largest property empire Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers possessed 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , then the family since 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded E@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 by 85 million US dollars .
this money was inv@@ ests in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their late father , Col@@ in - von Paul is described as &quot; main operator , &quot; and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a jurisdiction states that this means that Col@@ in property has the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem @-@ point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have been excluded .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but e@@ jects Paul , to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early monkey av@@ it , that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of law @-@ held law .
MS De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy shops have been operated in the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little kid ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi died , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers on trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the de Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answering by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to craw@@ l me and to pull our family name by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father could not have wanted Paul and I would be in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be resolved in the near future by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new staff leader is planning to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on an equal course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of the White House , together with man@@ ag@@ erial staff , he represented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wanted to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly has told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ xing diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ mp Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Candi@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral campa@@ igning Sam Nun@@ berg in February over Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in his time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s Twitter under control according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe this campaign does not know anything that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets had not included any more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his staff had already managed to keep his employees away from it , then their efforts have been worth it .
but no @-@ one has consistently prevented it that Tru@@ mp is okes controversy .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House which unites itself from competing parties , always try to drive their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that possibly promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the advis@@ ors to lead the president for strategic reasons without doubt .
this was an example that was described by porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press sections , above all those with damage le@@ aks , and that he moves out to figure out where they come from .
it was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President vi@@ cious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished from Twitter or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has expressed false evidence in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold makers added that the then staff Chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp@@ ram &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
meth@@ ane criminals get postal mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped .
the police across Europe sent this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the sought heavy @-@ criminal off@@ ence are not known , will be hoped for and pray for people from the people .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Advent@@ st calendar in the winter .
the experiences could have shown that many p@@ oul@@ ts hidden for vacation places , meant it from Euro@@ pol .
you have collected 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ an , over 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online requested could have been arrested , at least 11 of which are based on the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the war , which tra@@ ded one out of the municipality of tow@@ ed dit@@ ch to return a field in front of their man@@ sions .
travelers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they brought us horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ tes , after they were thrown out only in May , without being de@@ ported by any given by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tactical group found a gap in the defensive systems and pressed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging inhabitants have been attacked the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They have moved there on Monday night after they sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stones on the pas@@ sers .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement them , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , they were moved and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle long interrup@@ tions to protect their parks .
I &apos;m staying at Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying to my com@@ mons if the Council cannot stop this once . &quot;
a community that did not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridiculous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have been lifted up this time and you even saw a horse in a parking area . &quot;
a speaker at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said , &quot; We are aware of a dirt camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to enable them to move as soon as possible .
to support our mo@@ cking collection , it is very important that as many local residents sign an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must consider when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is situated .
the house in front of the Gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience operating company , on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenues across the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic upheav@@ als of refugees that came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation as an extensive set of interest for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the setting up of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l Upper Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time from serious interested parties in the house .
he should reserve the right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ yi with head @-@ leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ian , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad mines and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Birken@@ hof we have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time , and if one enters the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were swe@@ pt out , blankets that were partially secluded , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be converted , there will be new windows installed .
everything sol@@ le is &quot; nice to become &quot; beautiful &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ ers expresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ istics , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would set up wide , explains and explains .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the concep@@ tions of the city be covers with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments questioned , Thomas Sch@@ lers will not want to set out accurately .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also the outdoor facilities are brought to the front , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Off@@ ers places Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair concerning US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special participants , Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the panel was included in the work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the cause of trusted people .
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extends its investigation and intensified .
the CN@@ N channels reported it already the first inv@@ itations of the committee relating to a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a longer period of mixed up in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there was agreement between Tru@@ mp@@ s election team and Moscow .
the investigation of the investigation should be several men standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans .
reporting that Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the center a few weeks ago that the wai@@ ver of Tru@@ mp has moved personally to the center and seek the accus@@ ation if the President in the course of the affair may have ham@@ pered the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main purpose of Grand Law@@ ys is to check and determine the evidence of possible recur@@ rent cases to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the dock .
mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office to invite people to the hearing under E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N &apos;s CN@@ N , the inv@@ itations were already issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement , called it in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and law @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam election , Paul Man@@ kind .
right @-@ wing said on Thursday evening in the US TV that I show that Mu@@ eller do not let go shy at his work and that he should be necessary to act fast .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the suspension of the ab@@ oration of the beginning of a new phase in investigations , and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening had a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats a chance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion he won &apos;t know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury .
however , this work also usually work in the secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ated all measures which accelerated the work of the Special Representative to &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey had told three times that not to be determined against President .
you have no reason to suppose that something changed on it , it was on the declaration further .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this instal@@ ment , alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judiciary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp had asked him to adjust the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
after representation of US media , the White House raised material against the special participants and its employees .
the extingu@@ ishing spec@@ ulations whether it would like Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent special issu@@ er of Congress as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ aires , Richard Ni@@ xon , has been a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the State Department .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step however .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic broadcast@@ ers presented on Thursday , according to which the Special E@@ mitt@@ ler could not be released as easily .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ ctic
in the West@@ ant@@ Arctic Arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been solved by the close to the size of Berlin by Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i .
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for polarity and marine research on Wednesday .
over a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of large Kol@@ oss Re@@ ve now north@@ ward and will probably have two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ice@@ berg that have registered in the last three decades .
a danger for people does not withdraw from him .
what extent the climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of the ice@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream bur@@ sts in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact @-@ background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it still grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this tren@@ ch was the balance of wa@@ xing and vom@@ iting a couple of years ago .
a full swing is to be broken there , AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
I speak quite a lot that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i is in danger , for the fore @-@ going Kan@@ te have never been as much withdrawn as it is currently .
moreover , the ice @-@ plate is at tension and can be broken down if at a key point out a piece of dro@@ p@@ out .
the melting of Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ i and ice@@ berg does not increase the level as it is floating on the water and ur@@ ging ice so much water as it results in the melting itself .
however , the loss of the swe@@ ep results in the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could eventually increase the level , but only in the low degree , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest swe@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is aware of , the ice@@ schild now comes into a endangered position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed he himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i will now grow again or perhaps coinci@@ ded , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers did not withdraw the break@@ up of this giant ice@@ berg , so in the past few decades a lot of ice @-@ casts are cru@@ mb@@ led in the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
this long strip of the Antar@@ ctic extends in direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined since the 1950s to 28 000 square kilometers .
to the decline , the temperature increased .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has been around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ amed to the areas where the temperature at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to be home @-@ if at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill @-@ out positions , calls the CD@@ U to step out of the employer project to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the creation of 41 new jobs in the administration have crossed .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were available for sale in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks .
currently there are at the district M@@ ett@@ mann , still 50 un@@ occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for general administration .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and confron@@ ting the skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is said to work under the request of the parties &quot; a concept to recru@@ iting personnel development and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands on professionals , but forward @-@ looking the application scar@@ city means it is called .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an educational campaign , challenge CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier so .
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of co@@ workers , the disease or alter@@ ations made of the service will be eff@@ ected .
so high time for action thus , lest even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he did long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he was publicly challenged the recruitment fee publicly and the other parties were aston@@ ished .
people want all possibilities to be checked by leaving a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfying solution , the county @-@ administration with the trade unions - maybe also in co @-@ operation with the affiliated towns - will strive for a bon@@ star@@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U seeks to pay better to the employees and officials , as the collective bar@@ gain for the public service actually fores@@ een .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the duties of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy gets the tone into the NGO @-@ migrants &quot; b@@ ail@@ out &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that employ li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they will not continue to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; said Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ dens &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has been in operation only for one year , refused to express in detail the Italian pro@@ vocation of the Italian pro@@ bro@@ gio carto@@ onist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that in the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and that the situation can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth ret@@ ched &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is believed that his crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mug@@ gler can drive , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting point was supposed to be just 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to dist@@ ort over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not of any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must be on board especially an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , has declined in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries are able to reach across Europe .
An@@ c@@ ages and Tri@@ als
nine turn@@ out bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two motor@@ ists met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and attractions .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the peac@@ o@@ zer forest and the prevalent levels .
in between there was always a longer time @-@ goat , for the long tri@@ b@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in future before computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium of stadium ?
fact : e @-@ Sports has long since become a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
this also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July a E @-@ Sport Division founded and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire all the new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be able to rise up several associations on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next weekend , the football World association FIFA organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified for example .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football need to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people are still going to go to the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : associations trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be much more often present in these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ul to Asia .
what is it all about ?
when e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation of FIFA at competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and when Asian , e @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is this a real sport ?
for many , the idea is safe .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atics has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ Sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress actions , hormonal changes .
furthermore , there is cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also exercising their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the seals also has problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are tough at online play , and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , it has been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
sales will be expected to reach 130 million in three years .
against the barely 2.@@ 4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ der Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as a teaching , says F@@ rob@@ ola .
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ league associations according to Dut@@ t has now been obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; compared to Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
just fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times , it is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the organisation , but to align the company at the same time a modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , which will push Conrad Roy to su@@ icide ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was condemned in June because of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ end@@ lessly .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy did a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ ful bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ looking eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pro@@ secutor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility whatsoever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circumstance that they are completely de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even her brain disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read an explanation by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day &quot; that I did not miss the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we shall bear with us for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pursued by the realization &apos; that she will never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person with whom I have been together for my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit to a different su@@ icide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon dioxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention , after Car@@ ters statements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging yourself , Spring of a building , er@@ ste@@ che yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking attention from the death of Roy , and orda@@ ined that they should benefit by any media from the fall .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x belonged to the 2007 due to murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ my of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain was not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern entrusted the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season to get an extra motivation were not enough .
something was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua prompt immediately , even though the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups is of course not a Philipp Lah@@ my and no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself the thrust of the band@@ man to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of coach could also suggest .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in those of youth players , Deb@@ ut@@ ors and just selected from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he .
su@@ gars are distributed among the most ende@@ aring to those who you want to keep in the mood .
whoever has been chosen to compete the legacy of Lah@@ my , can use a small extra motivation only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ it@@ ated the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ my over the field .
to the right rear , which is now its position , the white bin@@ ders at the arm did the rest .
and at all , prepare me in this start @-@ up such as the one who can take the Ru@@ der also best into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the im@@ pregn@@ ated tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy themselves .
Vid@@ al makes it possible to over@@ play its missing fitness ( folding ) ; Renato San@@ ches to make up on the devil come out on the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver to drop in their first appearance in Bavaria Tri@@ co@@ t .
this was really good .
Sü@@ le ran besides Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agi@@ a sovereig@@ n@@ ly .
the well occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often heavy , in addition the sweet@@ ness did a couple of times in playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave me that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance upon his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ itting , Tem@@ po@@ change@@ over : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ accustomed to this Bavaria &apos;s world still for the new arri@@ vals , you saw afterwards to the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave us not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me passed after a few cr@@ ack@@ able statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to bring the new one more .

company satisfied with R@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Ministers : business commen@@ ds resistance speed
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic ministries of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , where the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ amed the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ers ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito control of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the pri@@ ori@@ ent list of the country .
even this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process up to 2021 the building should be right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ byp@@ assing Tri@@ er , which is in the vor@@ urgent need of the federal cover plan .
the aim is to take the distance in December 2020 into operation , says Minister of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks to energi@@ ze the Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to launch their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master @-@ bonus , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided is a premium of 1000 euros for the examination of the examination and 2500 euros , if graduates are independent within ten years after the Master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , be quick facts to create , at the same time , they l@@ acked the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; von 56 new engineers , who wants to set up the Wis@@ sing at the national business of mobility have so far been occupied by 29 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Group vice @-@ group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting system , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than suggested by the preservation of the country roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
again , the previous broad@@ band broad@@ band is in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 .
they evaluate themselves in sc@@ aling Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ economics Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is at the moment out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they were already back the field after four months because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a bac@@ kl@@ ash
one day prior to the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software to update in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions regulations .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines apply , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to be installed , take also to know what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices , which could regulate the regulations when a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions .
several employees were accused of Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics were arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminals in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused Audi to have a system installed to deal with the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could affect Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer carries over proportional to the gain of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ itting n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most widely published carto@@ on carto@@ on@@ ists , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also at 85 the Argent@@ inian lives and works in a film .
his message : laughing , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he struck himself among other things as a artist for fel@@ ic@@ ts cards from - which brought him fruit .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he managed to make a breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines surrounding the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo took a lot of fans .
again , the artists of cities inspire again and again .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ bling in drawings with the sli@@ der Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he was still sitting at the drawing table still alive today , nearly ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches will find his im@@ min@@ ent figures still a lot of spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los and most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ pi@@ d as the counter @-@ player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why it mainly focuses on the TV series , which is produced , like its original labels .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions of recall conditions and because of the path@@ ological insects , which attempt scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , big headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agro@@ research Institute CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and fall much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ col@@ ates , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with the etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered , better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the audi@@ t@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in th@@ eli@@ an R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its year @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce meet normally to check out their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : you should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or make them feel at home .
safety experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abdom@@ inal pain .
there are drug barriers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspi@@ cious to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no hibernation of violence , and while in the whole land the cor@@ p@@ ses are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand for attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz und until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , her editors and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
its lack is perceived deep though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 has been a Son@@ der &apos;s office , in order to process the cases of journalists , it was introduced according to the Committee to protect journalists from only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings associated each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they are still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ end@@ able , and although the terrain is now even pu@@ zz@@ ling .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive just a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ d river . &quot;
the ar@@ cher was driving away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ors tend to be free to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ akers last year and the ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival@@ ing groups fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the streets , or that the cemetery is full of distributed two @-@ story Maus@@ s for drug royal people who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a box has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alled cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have upset the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country into its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican power against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues uncovered that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as experienced repor@@ ters for Nor@@ el@@ este , when he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 USD .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having to encounter the rough @-@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper deserved a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it to publish tough apt without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , who dar@@ ed nobody else to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she was awarded the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead .
he gave voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must take the task that you choose as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in view of so many ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mixed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted to his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and always sit there at the same table .
well , she asks : was his love of routine his disaster ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ run@@ way and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it is wrong , keep away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , poor institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware that is sold solely to governments , for monitoring journalists and activ@@ ist in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a vi@@ cious building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who did not act as trusted as the governor .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs of drugs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has appeared on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expedition to the government spending , focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the pro@@ secutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug ad@@ ministers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was written from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all political levels almost all of the century .
recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of severe cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this local pub , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man de@@ igned a military over@@ fall .
only a few months before the reader had viewed the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has become a storage room for signs and sti@@ cker to protest against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something of what they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mi@@ ri@@ ot Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ aps up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the Office of the Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of it .
throughout the country journalists have become sound@@ ly that in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; have been written on side@@ ways and structures .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and bring them around because they told the truth .
she has since then asked that she is re@@ united by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organised by organised crime involved in government officials and a similar society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug policies , but also by politicians and security guards held by organised crime among a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ whales group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place over the last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded thou , because they want that you hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern Border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas box : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ stat@@ or and ear@@ phones lay beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include as the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern Border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others make on as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the murder of its director in 2004 .
2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes it hun@@ ted , as it seems to be murdered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who want to stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be the poet , gives him scar@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band enri@@ ches and security guards near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had confirmed 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate , as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge you have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ aps near to - a further sho@@ ving in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept the watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they showed it not .
under the enormous portrait of the Fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its mark .
&quot; how can you also just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day , where Javier was murdered , the train@@ ee me asked to send it to the coverage of the road . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain work were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even realize that his sk@@ inn@@ y skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; referred him as &quot; the bes@@ ter@@ ated dinosau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he died on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
he met something which seemed missing from the surrounding rock on the board , and decided to look more accurately .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy pe@@ p@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the ready @-@ to @-@ finish result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re b@@ linking only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main @-@ author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; in science history it is considered one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although he is covered with a arm@@ or is resembles a changing tanks , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to hide themselves from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ar@@ king technology that is used as contrasts that is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to do@@ dge his enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made the headlines in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and es Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta be@@ ad@@ ch@@ elli named after the Muse@@ um@@ ber techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the copies made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sha@@ ding is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far superior to the animals living today .
it points toward the fact that the dinosau@@ rs hun@@ ts enough pressure by meat @-@ breaking dinosau@@ rs , the evolution that fav@@ ors the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or cor@@ als - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was mar@@ oon .
scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life , including his consistent Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ r , when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea where it sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with consistent skin and retains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that animal today looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k time .
you do not need much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only do a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ran@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avier monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is buried after the death in the sea and was converted to mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the bes@@ po@@ ed dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ vor@@ es was dra@@ ined by the Western Canada until a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea .
but the Under@@ water t@@ ying of the dinosau@@ rs , his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden remn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still bump@@ y arm@@ or along the dinosau@@ rs .
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ alled v@@ est of the skin still cover the bump@@ y arm@@ or that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
his right for@@ f@@ le is lying on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .
I can count the scales in his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
intense accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , long @-@ long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday morning , some 20 people have been violated .
according to the police after 17 : 00 between the connector , Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm were almost 30 cars , among them probably also trucks .
the exact number of injured lies at first no data .
it is light to medium @-@ sized violations , said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a large set of rescue vehicles was at the accident court .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the Munich of Munich there formed a distance of approximately ten kilometres long back jam .
like a AZ re@@ porter , it also came on the anti @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ fighter set up the mark of the vehicle thin@@ ker that have now to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , there was another second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
at the same time , there was a collision between a car level and a car .
a SA@@ R @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or she is deep in his work and has just got an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the sheep and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ or , or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
tickets check .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently the Deutsche Bahn Station .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken their place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently , a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other rail routes in Germany , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the railway line without creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
you have to also have bought it via the app of the railways to the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customers then a button becomes the electronic de@@ valuation .
the Zug@@ manager get a message on their mobile devices that Tim@@ g@@ ast X is on the train and taken the one booked at the Y Y .
comes the train companion at the ticket control to No. Y knows that there is a passenger sitting with already dischar@@ ged online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to continue .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; anyone who wants to travel without ticket control through our train companion , checked in the DB navig@@ ator simply itself .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , knows that besides delays and missed trains the ticket checks should be among the biggest off@@ ences .
for often , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travellers do not need any documents which need to be used for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document that must be pre@@ wise .
the consequence are endless discussions between tractor and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the section or large space , and delays in controlling their own tickets and the creation takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how a activ@@ ist got to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to their core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , that sat in St. Louis , on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled across a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else had posted the information on her desk , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ ler @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually restored on their tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was to death the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he over@@ took a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ blo@@ om body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought of Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she moved her cell to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the crying , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns Father who carried a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live @-@ feed , where a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ous dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another poli@@ cem@@ an is his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I all kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ z fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 pm she fet@@ ched her father &apos;s 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance eman@@ ating from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove , the two had a conversation that she had countless times before this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how often I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not bring them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to freely rid ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced any e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from af@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which became a camp@@ ground as the activists waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined together with a local business@@ man who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell Form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all right . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her camera @-@ ann Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rare wanted to document only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to the meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by white men - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and grew up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on who did not get centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area who is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ in@@ kt .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following browsers .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on fer@@ ous experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most apparent participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells lives , as she loves and mar@@ ry her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ y@@ ells history reiter@@ ated the role of the black @-@ gay women in the broader black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ ung Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as schw@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , sul@@ ule women need to wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to realize that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fer@@ rell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , though it was at the forefront because of a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the church and the police have continued to exist .
Fer@@ rell is par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ amm@@ ates himself to a singing and she feels obliged to her memory since she went onto the streets three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV reader talks about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south side of the pedestrian prec@@ inct divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the issue hardly any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the one to say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ an@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , the rest of the shops also benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ ari@@ ed .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farm@@ market stands , in which 13 direct markets market its products .
the start of construction will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a brand hall in the new building - and there &apos;s enough room for sitting outside sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been going to buy a weekly market hall for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy to be .
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; if direct markets in a market hall in the gallery arrive at the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it would probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why shopping centers in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ages or supermarkets : I think that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many cargo shops are empty here - some have been around for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the manufacturer and is very inexpensive .
as you see , cargo shops are located in a shopping center only for larger companies , because the local rents are often not viable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty stores there are almost no more and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmhouse market during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit @-@ gallery will actually come .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery before to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
and a shopping centre , which stands empty , also needs no one .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market , there is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place any more .
when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - which are hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg made of che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her of Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st turned out a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she made publicly challenged diplomatic reports on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ ard resem@@ blan@@ ce ( a suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her professional competence in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and pioneering Dis@@ si@@ bilities , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithm analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and out of the thirty portraits , a sharp if something intellectual comment may not only be interpreted by the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and created the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 votes against the sp@@ y Act , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ ing , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie , sitting in the Mann@@ ing clearly uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ former per@@ tin@@ ts - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette mu@@ mel and chew@@ ing g@@ um , trying to extract the DNA from waste , in order to produce an image of how these people could look .
this was the time when she obtained an e @-@ mail from a newspaper mag@@ azin .
&quot; she conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she was not able to visit this time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were subject to unequal letters that were inter@@ changeable in the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sup@@ pressed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sup@@ pressed images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ ees a future where President Chel@@ an judgement would turn and they were able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release would call for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of bl@@ iss@@ ful coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little high@@ land and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tru@@ mp brings a war against in@@ forman@@ ts out of the government and against Trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in a wall shown on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with their over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a jack of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorpor@@ ating the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ o@@ tide according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) show how amazing much , at least in biological ways , all of us are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic no@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ on in his hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arity of the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your speech , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , sal@@ utes from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get started , when I &apos;m talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks , from their own genom@@ ic simulation , that together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , were written with pencil for their genetic cat@@ alo@@ ons .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement , formed with Chelsea like the movement , which also hidden behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing .
a nationwide woman @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who had been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday we were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ p ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , as the acts of the Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
one of the municipalities of the Chicago publication of the Chicago publication report states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained at the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ch as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them@@ self has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ es , the Vice @-@ President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ p was now being excluded and excluded from the Bet@@ ting of the North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , and willing to help the U.S. investig@@ ators authorities every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he calls on the susp@@ ects and urge the authorities to address the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their residence and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the Building Manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who said in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ o and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian vi@@ gi@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ ci@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada schedule was updated in this respect , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comment@@ ated the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the Rest@@ oration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the Organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could give rise to Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results of the W@@ ada permit investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;s stat@@ ely funded Dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system put a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ed &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
talking to the Russian outlets R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; said S@@ mir@@ nov .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main square of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business to become not the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure your staff lucky on your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys are not working .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not lament the process .
&quot; there was simply no consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Gesellschaft Ma@@ dison Reed .
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is best to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement , it enables companies to provide specific@@ ity and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint Hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite managers and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure colleagues .
Er@@ re@@ tt said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the s@@ nap surveys and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which indicates a view which units have most griev@@ ances and which managers have low resolution results - so that you can drill .
companies do come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post , who described an environment of ins@@ ults , in which those who have spoken , were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , after the financial technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send custom @-@ tailored &quot; powder &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , with which staff can report a bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that its employees treated poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , workers and fluctu@@ ations , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent more than a year has been employed to ensure that staff are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of workers .
now , as the company employs Conver@@ cent , problems , which were previously made by executives , that were formerly identified in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ du@@ ly internship - are identified more quickly and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree visibility in the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment @-@ employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and co @-@ workers in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen has collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you were not able to prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ ist@@ ling secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve renov@@ ate when their portfolio companies are well running . companies run well when employees are working and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance .
the data on staff commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes are on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this can dis@@ rupt dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have more than 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting on the Business Management company Kot@@ ar International , who has seen it too much on the collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom do you not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employees by monthly surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ating employees it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the staff , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer then you will lose businesses .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the rup@@ ture
it &apos;s going to be at 11@@ am when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint is on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ ot@@ ourism and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team this few minutes make a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses are returning after the dre@@ aming exercise to their final check , before taking the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water @-@ Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it has extended their days in fact - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock to meet the already packed schedules the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood is postponed the beginning of the camp just a week after the last season and during the summer school , during Mor@@ as , six times , during the summer school , conducted practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he ass@@ esses the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add another point to the many employed routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it down , they re@@ plac@@ ings , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear sightings of its fields from an adjoining car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with foot@@ prints , which will be no easy task behind a door@@ p@@ fo@@ sten .
brood @-@ players should fill the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up a exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports from third parties and show their results under the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest online social network is on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send it to Fak@@ ten@@ ant testing that may display results of the fact examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flooded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks should be punished if they did not succeed in preventing h@@ asser@@ ting post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in English , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of the new facts .
&quot; besides the knowledge , which stories of the fact @-@ handed over @-@ handed parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to his news feeds to reduce false news .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle could be seen in a squeeze music and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years a slip hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary .
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he expects an emo@@ tionally emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a col@@ agen@@ ten in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters still smells by smoke , for then one fires a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has done so with old papers , he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I did a little over@@ valued , &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mon@@ ary hy@@ ena @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the ancient castle and talked to landscap@@ ing , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 than the last experience , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the staff began to take care of the archive that he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English indign@@ ation , maps that represent what had possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke who fought two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Black of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers , that the family Dar@@ rell hid seven years in the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell appeared in the 18th century that filled his own funeral by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than its coff@@ in was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed almost to be ga@@ unt@@ let , always making debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men extingu@@ ishing their debt crises , having married rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences .
he has had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ noch män@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ funded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to go back with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the sleeve of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday launched her campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
still up Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August it should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters to the rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; write them on their yesterday activated website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that much is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ our citizens are very likely to know about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action you go for more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that the city gives an unmistak@@ able unique appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ fifth amount can be the city of Bad Honnef with its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s scar@@ fs fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about retirement and subsidies in the Off@@ icers .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session did not take place any more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
at the presidency of the Heads of Government , the five vice president and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number .
the government moves to the military in the military .
the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air@@ man and the nav@@ y were put down .
since the failed coup , State Power Erdogan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who Erdogan as a wire dra@@ wer in the coup .
against 4@@ 86 individuals who were supposed to have been involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated since this week in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup in Erdogan , Erdogan was referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifested in the repe@@ al of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the large clean@@ se in the army and the security guards will go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of July Erdogan by decre@@ es left additional 7@@ 3@@ 95 state officer , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual gentlemen of the country .
three times put them under appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardian of the secular state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan was stepping up the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdogan is targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a name not called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such development could not be cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , there is doubt about the freedom of the Turkish army in the alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; they say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees the legal immigrants to reduce 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for issuing vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support yourself and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ e track for racing
over the past few months over the future of the racing series has been cut down - now it &apos;s going to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year it is scheduled to be built at the tra@@ deshow circuit , on which the tourist railway drives , built .
in order to secure the future of the race in a long term , according to the traffic of the Department of Tourism , the road should start on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ e the track of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ ingen , the country becomes important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of correc@@ ting the track is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this end , the country is 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contract in which the shuttle shall also be ordered in the future from the country , I am currently conclu@@ ding , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the south @-@ train station as an operator had already agreed on the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so the racing sti@@ ff @-@ Shuttle can be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing sti@@ ff @-@ shuttle is one especially in the tourist destinations between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of the past few months , the track has been tested as a pilot plant if the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them in the future .
the track is also in parts very quiet .
the rise of sex robo@@ tic is real and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robo@@ tics in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ated professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern s@@ exp@@ els have developed from its infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silic@@ on skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot correspon@@ d@@ ingly according to his beliefs , &quot; and selecting everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be more disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a steppe @-@ woman progres@@ sively .
modern s@@ exp@@ els have become robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing as su@@ prem@@ acy .
and then there is the true self @-@ designed Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True R@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many troub@@ ling aspects in this rise of sex robo@@ tic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the dig@@ ni@@ fied feminine traits - if one is taking a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist ) Far@@ rah , un@@ troubled one at most .
on his website ad@@ vices True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then have a Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex @-@ robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course hold no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R noticed their growing popularity , they still stay provisional on the edge of consumption culture .
but what perme@@ ates out of the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and a lot of people are not strange , abu@@ sive until the free market gives them their permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robot are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened with a president in which there is a president in the White House which has led to have women sexually attacked .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the inter@@ tw@@ ined body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision affects .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the target behind these sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not a real women .
they cannot be removed from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement , or a background story , nothing that could interfere with independence or anything , which could interfere with the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation .
in other words , you are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the expressions of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of a common sense of human dignity
it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that pol@@ ls have pol@@ arized the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US constitu@@ encies , even families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ esto thank@@ fully , there was newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s own relatives .
we are all alleged to keep our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power asset to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
they reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone , who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which they had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presidency has the force to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp we refer to the gr@@ in@@ ely way that one day we cannot rep@@ el one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is still a start@@ ling long @-@ time scenario , in which Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans is norm@@ alized the right wing , which suddenly appear once in comparison to its standards as a term of reasonable .
I find myself today about an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ging version of the reverse tax , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both when compared to Tru@@ mp are in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only need to be spiritually healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ her of the New York car department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous size , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate @-@ friendly music conve@@ ys this in strange manner .
so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since here two two year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I reached my credit card .
at the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .
this leads to not only a slow@@ down of what a neutral replacement should be , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor lady in the department store was exc@@ used gr@@ aci@@ ously while I had tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to the hospital with breast pain
Pist@@ ar@@ us left the prison for the second time in prison for hosp@@ it@@ alisation .
last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hands , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ar@@ us was condemned because of the murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first sk@@ ull .
he k@@ ills Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by leaving it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us affir@@ med that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say it is too thoughtful .
the national law enforcement authorities said that she will be raising the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ar@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .

as Bauer Arnold is a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the quadru@@ pe@@ ds of guns and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and into the continuing schools .
three of the students in the future go to the gymn@@ asium , four to the real school .
Schul@@ werk Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil haus Bi@@ es@@ ale in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen on the evening evening .
as a symbol of the school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des bought a young eagle , who is rising in the chicken court , but then the freedom will be released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led the m@@ n Sch@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken .
instead of a chicken stock a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of it a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eagle kno@@ cked up on a high mountain at a high mountain and dis@@ ap@@ tured .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who bore cy@@ linders to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ le@@ an@@ gler Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every quad@@ rup@@ ture that he felt at his new school .
the key@@ word followed by the colleagues , the former Schul@@ Manager Michael Müller , who always jumps again at Unter@@ stur@@ sen@@ g@@ p@@ äs@@ sen , and the parents representatives .
the kitchen time was over now , the Cl@@ ass@@ ay instructor Sophia Schumacher .
she leave her students after two years of lessons only very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , they have been able to rely on the quad@@ rup@@ ture .
on completion of all the students had a song of summer time and vacation time .
in doing so , the children broke great joy .
for the new school year , eight first @-@ time artists are already registered .

software update for diesel cars : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
need diesel drivers to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the exhau@@ st behaviour of cars of the emission classes 5 and partially in Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or bad are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europa are estim@@ ations :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the retro@@ fit has arranged the power station Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a high level of implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as a precise date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if any inspection may be paid , it will be done in their frames .
how long should the equipment be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
these depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that he voluntarily act on the car manufacturers on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not have a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
now is a massive prize of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared .
but even in the regions where the bot@@ tom@@ less dro@@ w .
in rural areas there are so far no lock@@ ers for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to be seen with a sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the Washington &apos;s glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ prize under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives as the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards given by the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the culmin@@ ation direction on Thursday announced , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Ri@@ chie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
be handed over to the awards beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp are holding a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania to join the awar@@ ding .
the Le@@ ar @-@ series with progressive TV @-@ series announced that it already announced that participation in the gala has already been announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to depri@@ ve the arts and human rights - even the means to depri@@ ve them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the interview with Tru@@ mp for making it clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre after the former president John F. Kennedy @-@ Center is the greatest cul@@ tu@@ re@@ direction in the U.S. capital .

we are making the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in R@@ ente in the coming year .
the location is already written - appropriate applicants are rare .
for 31 years has been W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he taught in the press talk .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor .
at the same time , it mir@@ t him that so far there is no application to feed the application profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
this is how it should be in compliance with the regulatory notice of notice - even enough time for development .
since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administration of the administration as a sub @-@ law office , the applicant must assign appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill out these things , the citizens would have to drive up to Offen@@ burg .
but civil proximity is the city and itself important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years of ministry , some significant projects have been gathered , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are around .
the Kin@@ onal bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium is still subject matter .
the latter alone will hit with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; all in all are waiting great tasks to my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
creative be available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master great room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction yard and gardening , it can react very flexible to many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what it fits , &quot; if new buildings are approved , acc@@ entu@@ ated the schei@@ d city champion .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a Bau@@ herr , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes here about my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( high construction ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( low @-@ construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we seek someone who really identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to be@@ wit@@ ched Roland W@@ acker should elaborate on the city of Has@@ lach as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in technical expertise and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law .
the municipal office unter@@ lie high and deep construction , construction planning , under@@ value matters , administration of urban property , urban operation with building yard and urban gardens , as well as sub @-@ law enforcement authority , including memorial protection .
throwing bike on the lines : south @-@ route locked
according to the police , the previously unknown do@@ ers had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so strongly that the her@@ nia carrier had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them for night hours .
near the scene were witnesses of witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ der roller and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ ech Christoph Pos@@ ch to the A@@ PA .
the or the perpetrators brought themselves into great danger and also jeop@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the resort as well as the delay and the costs of the rail transport , the road network could also be sent to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether be of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage were repaired on Friday afternoon , the train traffic on the south @-@ route could be led without a disability .
almost 10 people you &apos;ve been Friday afternoon , two of them consider the correspondence .
freight trains not fell from , but they had no delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of over@@ head .
the ins@@ ulators and the ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition that in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 affects stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are normally advised to relie@@ ve meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Universität out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins tend to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure the damaging micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not penetrate the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance conve@@ ys immune cell on mice found that a certain bacter@@ ium carry in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had them from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet is causing no less inflammatory , when the same system is wir@@ ling with people .
the post@@ doctoral students in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan analysed a sort of immune cell that encourages the tolerance , as she found out that a group of study groups had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe but which was divided apart .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the dam@@ s of mice were found DNA sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without they fail with the mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ful environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria pers@@ ists on the immune system , the researchers can grow L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid , and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed towards the tolerant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ de@@ es were hal@@ ved , the number of cells sank around the half .
Dr Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our Ga@@ stro @-@ In@@ test@@ es .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i developed the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially a high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .

however , MA@@ TIC was excluded from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which was M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to improve that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .

besides M@@ atic , also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadion , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho opened his start @-@ XI to start the season .
the Independent unvei@@ led this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho continued to wish three more new commitments , but he insisted that the Club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority obligations .
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the manufacturer &apos;s automobile manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US @-@ State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the bike paths the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new impetus for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel is still the SPD boss , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister has always been with a certain concern for Berlin .
only no stor@@ fire from the party central , merely no bac@@ kl@@ ash out of the covenant - so listen to the most important wish of the comb@@ at@@ ant champi@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House will be watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were depression .
and one after another .
the C@@ CD@@ U fores@@ ees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens according to the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; it shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reli@@ ant , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising Fra@@ gment of a Green D MEP , has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the landing stage lost its red @-@ green coalition with it its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Group &apos;s CEO Michael Kellner has called on the ab@@ ou@@ rage of the Lower Saxony @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ires to return its mandate .
the crossing to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Minister and election of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ mm@@ ed a SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coun@@ sel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as on Friday morning the new hip message has reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the crossing of the Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ires to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary height of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expec@@ tedly marked defeat in the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , more not cal@@ med down the comrades at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia , everything will be different .
this became even worse - and everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute @-@ Party cuts the party smoothly .
ar@@ du@@ ous the comrades in the weeks after it resum@@ ed .
then , when they had straight new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next depression came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication , he did pretty much everything that one can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z fights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW EOS and its role as Chairman of the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister had been in criticism already for a longer time .
mi@@ esis de@@ tain@@ ees were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of course , Wei@@ l tried to sit more and more in the past weeks to acc@@ ent the acc@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained un@@ conce@@ aled by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they left him , as they promised a stabil@@ isation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now , the exact opposite could arise .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is in the internal internal constraints of the Lower Saxony in the reason no fault .
and Schulz did not at all .
sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
your wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the ab@@ lit parliament@@ arians T@@ ires .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic that Mrs T@@ ires puts their own career income through the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ ires has not been elected as direct candidate for its person , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Dutch parliament@@ arians continued .
the logical consequence would it be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag faction , compl@@ ained a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the German @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ MEPs the electoral result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ k@@ ern III
who wants to be commented in the years house can soon get support from the country .
informed about the Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look at the so far back .
since 1991 there are in delicate refurb@@ ishment areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the total assets .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the past renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to further the interior development , and not only to develop new building areas .
on 4 April we received the information of the Govern@@ ors of Govern@@ ors that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total amount is 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which Che@@ at 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation are delicate .
now how is a refurb@@ ishment area ?
one will continue to explore , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area in general interest rate , to san@@ king .
if necessary , the denti@@ tion limits could also move again .
the pon@@ to@@ on occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme , in which the renov@@ ations would then be conducted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the actions would be object @-@ related , that is said per property .
the refurb@@ ishment area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area to fill a questionnaire to fill .
in November or December , it is intended to take place as the pro@@ posi@@ tional form , so that the renov@@ ations can begin in the coming year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each Comm@@ une has to conduct the said alleg@@ ations .
it is about assessing the city &apos;s au@@ tism and decide when to be sanc@@ tioned and to what extent .
for the respective property there is also a san@@ itation note in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again and get an image of the situation she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project and the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out to the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and motherboard &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which among other things is about the construc@@ ting state and re@@ development views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray form , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget and flat @-@ arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may provide information on size , distribution and residents of an area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arc &quot; is only to fill when in building business rooms are operated .
however , note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
new construction measures are also not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind gre@@ ener &quot; - who comes first , promp@@ ts first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reserve the funding period for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the end , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors puts himself a micro@@ chi@@ pped to get into house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a microwave chip , so that he can open his door@@ step to start his office and even start his car with a sil@@ ky movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ thes@@ ists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , gathered to ensure that the implant procedures is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chi@@ pped and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
married father of one has now built both at home and at BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the adver@@ t costs of the White House will cost tax@@ payers thousands
the decision of the White House , a naval helicopter to fly to the South Law@@ n for an event flying the American manufacturing last month , it costs payers according to the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter @-@ made helicopter was issued next to a yacht in Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi .
the White House of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Law@@ n , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I only wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , Vice @-@ Mar@@ ine@@ commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was evacu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the utility hours a second team would need for the return flight .
the original flight at the event was during the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether there was ultimately a second flight treatment required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits the federal states to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; a question that we created was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; it sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he pro@@ pa@@ gi@@ fted the efforts for the con@@ tainment of government rules .
the use of the airplane , which is known as marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use it for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ op request is unusual .
Tru@@ mp carried out an examination in February when the Presidential aircraft was in front of the background of his first camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that evaluate the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said Vice @-@ President of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Law@@ n , to cut down the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tru@@ mp was at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 practice areas .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event included in the training requirement of the air@@ aid for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter @-@ units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other Re@@ qu@@ is@@ ites presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential flight , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ aria from the US Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D capability for the v@@ H @-@ 3D charges 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of the unit lists the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ payers are on the basis of the estimates for the reimbur@@ sement , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the expenses of DO@@ D not contain personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ agna , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ell@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course reasonable to highlight the highlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tru@@ mp talked to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ We@@ iss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow after 11 am in Kiel at the tab@@ lo@@ gue Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite after five games still a flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga have received the sense of reality .
Team@@ chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team which is still playing in quite similar formation .
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V above all imports from the Far North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Go@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ailing and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ ass@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; that is how it is difficult for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then you also need a good serving luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ jan@@ in .
it is currently in the Chall@@ enger &apos;s Chall@@ enger play in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not come to the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar tournament is held at the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c Kol@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for its first deployment in this season .

after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could again put back into the team again .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy by Donald Tru@@ mp , Donald Tru@@ mp does not use his signature under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I packed the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow also was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels is har@@ med against the US impulse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft is seen to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , who have been co @-@ financed with other European firms in the construction of the Russian East @-@ Zealand Nord Stream .
the threat of threat is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have had to resur@@ rec@@ t sanctions by an executive order .
twelve weapons are at your choice .

Rolle backward : the city provides 46 chefs
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ Super@@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock has revers@@ ed the clock in the urban kinder@@ gartens .
as of September 1 , the town Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nursery for day@@ care institutions ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked continues besides house : a Cater@@ ina assumes this task and delivers fresh water @-@ cool@@ ed .
the city runs in the district of 46 kinder@@ gartens , in 44 children at lun@@ ch@@ time get a hot meal .
in the past year @-@ up year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you eat not only children who will be taken care of the 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour support if children remain until 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the angel@@ ic food , supplement it around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the meal individually , give the food off , sink and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are firmly assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ groups as well as seven @-@ dimensional institutions - decided over the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more integrated , and it is easier for kit@@ es to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is about eating healthy eating and cook@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is there sensible .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person that is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the chef - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that they have placed in the cost of equity and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are to be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall in approximately 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans area not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will run at the R@@ ats@@ elections in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
choices can be only really representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban have published threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition of international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be peacefully set by a democratically elected government for the first time .
Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will continue to intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

GM@@ B concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company talked about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is adjacent to other products Hob@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced as the first to change their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ e of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express their concerns that funding for modernization of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win a clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
family generations have worked here and the labor force concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Region of Glasgow , a key pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising vital cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production performance compared to Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ites at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will immediately respond to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with colleagues and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . should our business processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago at N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t let in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to dis@@ solve its open @-@ air clause , but have they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world empire ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klub is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds at Manchester United .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of over 500@@ ,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a source near the Catal@@ ans anticip@@ ation that the club always has its best to look after him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be able to contact them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report relie@@ ved Pope brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of the bre@@ aches of Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continued for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ person of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained following the publication of the German press agency , he expects from the former rainforest Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger had expressed its deepest concerns about their own sub@@ stitu@@ tions or their own at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence in the domain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the intervention in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church , as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go on the church and that is a fine Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bat a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards over past decades because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse there is often Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger too .
completely wron@@ gly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger writes the reminder of &quot; My brother of the Pope &apos; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted to the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment assistant director Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen from 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s marked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is possible to hold that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied .
especially high emo@@ tion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also fall disastrous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to many other accus@@ ations , many victims may be appreciated by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the bre@@ wing sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was relie@@ ved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a lift , many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was able to grasp the oil , when a dom@@ eter musi@@ cally brought no top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ographer this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one does the trouble and reading all the 440 sides a long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger sometimes occurs .
he is just eight sides dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of the abet@@ tor or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the victims of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool had occurred outside of its efficiency .
it is possible to pres@@ t@@ oss him in the best , too late or having taken first hint not seriously enough .
the domin@@ ance of the school , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent record , &quot; sincerely , &quot; knowledgeable , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who gave the guys regular with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ l@@ ts and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and its high sti@@ tion@@ ality , which also resulted in wa@@ ders .
that he was not only kn@@ itted with chairs and cast the key@@ lands on the ground , but also ear@@ phones distributed and too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair@@ s or ears , he himself gave herself to years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it .
towards his hon@@ orary salvation , however , must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widespread in the fragile period , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used in parents like with teachers .
do you also know such Bre@@ eding methods ?
naturally , I think every one of us who was born in front of 1968 .
also I have seen this in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bagh@@ dad .
you wonder if it was not likely to deal with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , a lot of media has just rus@@ hed to him .
on the Bav@@ arian , many people never have understood him , still ze@@ al@@ ly .
however the truth is : the report is relie@@ ved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
in connection with the report , the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also placed in the final report also some amal@@ gam@@ ation or bro@@ therhood with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ b@@ ance representing the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true issue in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they do not even trusted parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who , however , would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to mis@@ bre@@ aches ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a be@@ zz@@ led student formed this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had written ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely insight and could hold the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to embrace that himself would be more urgent or more clear , or more likely to have opened up against their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ern , trust instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they entrusted him in advance of the affected students and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus fre@@ eing from every co @-@ knowledge .
thus it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought it to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown away in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely such a abuse of the report .
namely , there is clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asium of the cathedral sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence , we are saying once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report from the time had been treated from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which l@@ ad of sa@@ vi@@ ed teachers were regul@@ arized and mal@@ ign@@ ant and listed , all in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger not to do anything , because he didn &apos;t get the young to face when they had already been on the cathedral @-@ run school .
on that one was like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in terms of the domin@@ ance of the school ?
Michael H@@ emann : there has been a discipline , but not yet @-@ garde violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims are appreciated by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there remains at most still the accus@@ ation to have taken away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which the states were reported at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations in a school , where he was not working and responsible ( such a witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then just around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently pursued the ears ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ scheme , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool I will continue to practice the test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the risk of negative prestige , he recommended an urgent one .
that was of course at a time when legal clarity was , when inspec@@ tors had long been banned in Bavaria too .
before that , they had occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
since it was difficult for him to estimate , where the persons affected may be exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted border had been crossed .
but one cannot say he would have always been away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we have historians talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; the danger of coming to today &apos;s moral measure .
Princess has already quite right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence in inno@@ cent children &apos;s pra@@ w@@ ns , that goes far beyond that of time .
that is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad it is finally working .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ chers and pull to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s .
when bodily punishment then was forbidden , he also kept strictly about it .
what image from his rainy season Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave me again in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &apos; ?
did the theme check out even for the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , since the dom@@ es@@ th@@ ats played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am by no means that he led a stric@@ ter regime there .
but that must be said once again : without this perfec@@ tionist , without the ever @-@ conditioned discipline , it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ y alone , you do not even make any big singer and in front of each success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of human beings have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and experienced again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt good people from which one cannot imagine that he could also do something in a fly .
I get regularly with , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still today , 23 years after his empowerment , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him up to now that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in a minority .
most dom@@ ic@@ ts are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , father@@ less teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect she was , to which she still look around and to honor them .
and please , once again clearly : all you pres@@ e@@ mit him are educ@@ ative methods that were at that time on the agenda .
we can be glad that we have overcome these times long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind , just too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published is relie@@ ved of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the landing areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany &apos;s probably no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace .
