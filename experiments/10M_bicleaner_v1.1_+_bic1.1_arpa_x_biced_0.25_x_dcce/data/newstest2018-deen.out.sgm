<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not currently up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to make himself upright, because the Auto-Navi instead of a bypassing road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of osteoportals in Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called urine sheets, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerisches Staatmeasurable administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump out of the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koaliation transeges with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical survey of Bayerns commissioned - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops relocated with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: the present neighbors, which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>

<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like everything else on the website of the Bayerisches Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the most striking example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the map of the map, so 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>

<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpostionsblatt, one read in the area of today's District Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "at the" Gasteig "or from the Andes-height" On the air, "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the eerfeldstrasse, there are once people with inscription.</seg>

<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">The area of the former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>

<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>

<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policy and racist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Assistance of the Federal State Missouri, which will take special attention until 28 August 2017, while travelling by the state would take special attention and voiced the first caution, since a number of fragmentary, rative incidents in recent times occur in the whole state and displayed here," says it in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri which makes it hard to gain discrimination, and proenforcement bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the journey, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights that people happen.</seg>

<seg id="59">Sanders, under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without having been accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the general state-owned by Missouri in which black motorists in the state can hold 75 percent more often than white.</seg>

<seg id="63">Missouri signed 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crimes reporting program of the FBI, which entered the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The trip warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to resign a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) commencement travel statements for Texas and Arizona, after countries adopted immigration laws, pledge the local law enforcement authorities to pledge people because of immigration law, which in view of the ACLU will contribute to further racial propulsion.</seg>
<seg id="66">The commencement of travel are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>

<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag: Peter White and Kordula Kovac have seen a picture on the spot.</seg>

<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they put their business" "", "the mayor stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism because of the promotion</seg>

<seg id="85">The area of this area is 40 hectares, which must not be forged until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the overall costs in the amount of 71 500 euros, half of the Leader is promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "therefore, farmers love to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of course." ""</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty before</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the soreness staged in Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a heated argument with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the president for the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller does not reach the statue yourself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-Imitators would have curled him if he would have done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their significance, and in particular the importance that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its basis.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta described:" "" "I don't want to go to a full thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem upon which you refer, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly right, but as he reformed itself, it does not really matter of history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your natured, your poor, / your oppressive masses who long for themselves to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "waste waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller Not committed himself to literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: indeed, it is a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - did know very well that they have accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical exposition.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the feminine figure is no longer abstractly - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not in charge, but rather an early neo-conservative, that bring the American flame into the replenished world: "lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the lamp of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and not a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they were inspired by the exhausted, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships has been seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not supposed to enlighten the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or they still live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medal winner, which is at its fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 checks are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstream Muir goes on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season that included the victory in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">She was reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannitts capitol said that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finer.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special team captain in the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour to me, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me to make something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: Bewirb not a public office if you cannot wear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from home policy up to its political principles.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Rights talks about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>

<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest-ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful of using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hasty head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the Governors page - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hoek Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockwork of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolling or spammers or water-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post office talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>

<seg id="186">"I commentated that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical leadership articels and to burn demonstrators or to silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens right.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche is invited to the old cemetery Areal in turmoil on Sunday, 16th July, at 16.30 a.m. to a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit-bang-Serenade can enchant itself from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Saving and maintaining the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village of village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuschapel was mentioned for the first time in the Wurttemberg Urtext book: Earl Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the main parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" by Magister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the judgment, according to the certificate of the certificate, the rightful mountain apart from the old parish church was also a glorious court toward which the church or the Patron was right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the sub-village and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the glorification of the village.</seg>

<seg id="477">The Lord, who built a church, occupied and occupied with a pastor, remained to the owner of this church and was also able to bequeve that church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with it was the right to use a pastor or proposing the bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The biggest of the two zerbarks at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell set then for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window discs were introduced and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undensely.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Overthrow of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger's Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the aid church broke down.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the cherry-storm allowed one to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Years, a storm took a storm the cherry and half plunged.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent a misfortune, the tower was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower of that still available Turmzwerg remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">For sure, PSG can make sure the money loose so Neymar starts and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich mistress of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may address a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to control with legitimate objection, which will enable them to take advantage of the Break-Even point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election at the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and riskicked to ruin, when banks or owners resigned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP focuses on the focus on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - has bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although PLAini 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceannin will continue to terrify from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Trafalso, who is responsible at UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out-clause of Neymar in a flat-scale, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so that the solution-solution for the next five years can be expired in the amount of 44.4 million euros in financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has the PSG along with Abu Dhabi that is owned by Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a budget of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the Mannitans members will remain limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overlist its financial supervision by making their revenue by companies that are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a vegetarian company can sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not have to be considered as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG Payments to Neymar could come to Neymar's payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar WM will be ambassador and a such manoeuvre for UEFA regulators simply could be out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to consider each attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, sagated on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of the anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship-Deals, merchandising and tricotourism.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers, and tried to prevent neymars removal, by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" co-financed Doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to the official owner of the PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house located in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their pockets.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square kilometers large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a spared layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to have high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she also commissioned das Architect and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan needed to think creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated" "", "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stunned to each other without we had to leave." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper window of retrouvius down across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gespiego gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him go longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer secluded units space for all seating and glasses of yoanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a guard.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, furnified MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is unimportant, so it is when you push the door very gently leads."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², one extra bedroom and one improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will arise and perform a calculation based on the ground floor."</seg>
<seg id="1349">They have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high-quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love you into the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers possessed 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, then the family since 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded Eans and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>

<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of law-held law.</seg>
<seg id="1373">MS De Lutis and her late husband Luigi, Italian immigrants, the dairy bars and delicacy shops have been operated in the late 1950-s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeansload of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began to Westco, when he was in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old).</seg>

<seg id="1396">Waxing diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tmp Trump by monitoring its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television dates back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>

<seg id="1404">If his staff had already managed to keep his employees away from it, then their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no-one has consistently prevented it that Trump is okes controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House which unites itself from competing parties, always try to drive their own agenda by promoting Trump material that possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fondness of the advisors to lead the president for strategic reasons without doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by porter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, above all those with damage leaks, and that he moves out to figure out where they come from.</seg>

<seg id="1535">The melting of Shelfei and iceberg does not increase the level as it is floating on the water and urging ice so much water as it results in the melting itself.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the conditions of recall conditions and because of the pathological insects, which attempt scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agroresearch Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and fall much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterial, the dwarf-colates, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have minor, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with the etheric oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce meet normally to check out their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: you should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades, or make them feel at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug barriers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no hibernation of violence, and while in the whole land the corpses are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012. 589 stand for attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editors and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack is perceived deep though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its mid-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the façade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmare, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 has been a Sonder's office, in order to process the cases of journalists, it was introduced according to the Committee to protect journalists from only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings associated each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still insist on the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrendable, and although the terrain is now even puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the Why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive just a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Tweld river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archer was driving away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Scaffolors tend to be free to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans reakers last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivaling groups fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets, or that the cemetery is full of distributed two-story Mauss for drug royal people who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a box has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalled cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gangmembers bought each copy of the issue as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country into its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican power against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues uncovered that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as experienced reporters for Noreleste, when he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 USD.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter the rough-dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper deserved a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish tough apt without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, who dared nobody else to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she was awarded the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take the task that you choose as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in view of so many... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team mixed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, she asks: was his love of routine his disaster?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homerunway and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous blend of lucrative smuggling, poor institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff from Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware that is sold solely to governments, for monitoring journalists and activist in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a vicious building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who did not act as trusted as the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs of drugs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has appeared on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an expedition to the government spending, focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug administers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was written from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost all political levels almost all of the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were accused of severe cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local pub, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman deigned a military overfall.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the reader had viewed the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has become a storage room for signs and sticker to protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something of what they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">"" "the Miriot Miriam Ramirez snaps up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the Office of the Office." ""</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of it.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country journalists have become soundly that in organised protests "SOS Press" have been written on sideways and structures.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez accused the authorities, journalists and bring them around because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is reunited by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organised by organised crime involved in government officials and a similar society." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even realize that his skinny skin was of reddish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology," referred him as "the besterated dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs, which lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he died on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something which seemed missing from the surrounding rock on the board, and decided to look more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy pepumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready-to-finish result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're blinking only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main-author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"in science history it is considered one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although he is covered with a armor is resembles a changing tanks, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide themselves from predators, and used a paracharking technology that is used as contrasts that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to dodge his enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made the headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and es Borealopelta beadchelli named after the Museumber technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the copies made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is customary, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far superior to the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points toward the fact that the dinosaurs hunts enough pressure by meat-breaking dinosaurs, the evolution that favors the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras, or corals - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was maroon.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life, including his consistent Darmintes to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went out into a river and went out into the sea where it sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with consistent skin and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that animal today looks almost as much as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need much fantasy to reconstruct it. if you only do a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthranrus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavier monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta is buried after the death in the sea and was converted to mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the bespoed dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that raged from his shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - which are hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheeks and haircuts that were sent to her of Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst turned out a 35-year prison sentence after she made publicly challenged diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Beard resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her professional competence in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transwife and pioneering Dissibilities, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithm analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from Manning and out of the thirty portraits, a sharp if something intellectual comment may not only be interpreted by the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and created the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 votes against the spy Act, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a basing, black-white Selfie, sitting in the Manning clearly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and carries a platformer pertints - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mumel and chewing gum, trying to extract the DNA from waste, in order to produce an image of how these people could look.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And she was not able to visit this time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>

<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little highland and Starkes, because Donald Trump brings a war against informants out of the government and against Transgender-troops to find new, tweetable paths that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a specific reason."</seg>

<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a jack of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 characters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) show how amazing much, at least in biological ways, all of us are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious memories, also to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure your staff lucky on your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys are not working.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not lament the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is best to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement, it enables companies to provide specificity and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint Hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowern allow to circumvent the C-suite managers and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and FitBit for the persecution of their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which indicates a view which units have most grievances and which managers have low resolution results - so that you can drill.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies do come to see that at the head of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post, who described an environment of insults, in which those who have spoken, were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent companies can send custom-tailored "powder" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline, with which staff can report a bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees treated poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, workers and fluctuations, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, convercent more than a year has been employed to ensure that staff are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of workers.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company employs Convercent, problems, which were previously made by executives, that were formerly identified in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unduly internship - are identified more quickly and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree visibility in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>

<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research, which shows that today's employees expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve renovate when their portfolio companies are well running. companies run well when employees are working and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find assistance.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on staff commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that changes are on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or at all, this can disrupt disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have more than 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting on the Business Management company Kotar International, who has seen it too much on the collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrating employees it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the staff, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector which is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle could be seen in a squeeze music and was for Margaret Thatcher in 1970-er and 1980-er years a slip hole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshiman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England's spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he expects an emotionally emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a colagenten in the 1700-er years, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters still smells by smoke, for then one fires a fire because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the monary hyena-heads at the walls and the bottles, the centuries spent in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the ancient castle and talked to landscaping, gardener and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 than the last experience, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the staff began to take care of the archive that he referred to as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book called 'Knightly Black of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robotic is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be even more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robotics in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeriated professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpels have developed from its inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot correspondingly according to his beliefs, "and selecting everything from the eye-colour of the robot to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more disturbing, since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a steppe-woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpels have become robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appealing as supremacy.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the true self-designed Roxxxy Gold Sex robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True Rion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has its moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubling aspects in this rise of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the dignified feminine traits - if one is taking a step on Frigid (means here: resist) Farrah, untroubled one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website advices True Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then have a Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper into our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course hold no sex robot, and while the FRR noticed their growing popularity, they still stay provisional on the edge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates out of the edge-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And a lot of people are not strange, abusive until the free market gives them their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robot are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened with a president in which there is a president in the White House which has led to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the intertwined body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision affects.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not a real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be removed from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement, or a background story, nothing that could interfere with independence or anything, which could interfere with the fantasy of total subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, you are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expressions of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of a common sense of human dignity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of the Trump era that polls have polarized the political divisions that polarized the US constituencies, even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernesto thankfully, there was newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's own relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all alleged to keep our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power asset to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented Dichterin, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone, who knows them, including the Republican kinship, with which they had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the force to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and Trump we refer to the grinely way that one day we cannot repel one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is still a startling long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans is normalized the right wing, which suddenly appear once in comparison to its standards as a term of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today about an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urging version of the reverse tax, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - both when compared to Trump are in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only need to be spiritually healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carusher of the New York car department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous size, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate-friendly music conveys this in strange manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many stereotypes of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience since here two two year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one was asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I reached my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to tip the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop table.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads to not only a slowdown of what a neutral replacement should be, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor lady in the department store was excused graciously while I had tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius relocated to the hospital with breast pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistarus left the prison for the second time in prison for hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hands, which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistarus was condemned because of the murder of the prosecutors against a first skull.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He kills Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine's Day 2013 by leaving it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius affirmed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The secutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius appeal, from which they say it is too thoughtful.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national law enforcement authorities said that she will be raising the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2542">This is how it should be in compliance with the regulatory notice of notice - even enough time for development.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is responsible for the administration of the administration as a sub-law office, the applicant must assign appropriate conclusions.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 affects stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally advised to relieve meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner Universität out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins tend to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure the damaging microbes that hide in the food, do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance conveys immune cell on mice found that a certain bacterium carry in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had them from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet is causing no less inflammatory, when the same system is wirling with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral students in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan analysed a sort of immune cell that encourages the tolerance, as she found out that a group of study groups had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe but which was divided apart.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dams of mice were found DNA sequencing and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without they fail with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilful environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria persists on the immune system, the researchers can grow L. reuteri in a liquid, and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed towards the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolism which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophandees were halved, the number of cells sank around the half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our Gastro-Intestes.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri developed the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially a high tryptophani can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter-made helicopter was issued next to a yacht in Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I only wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, Vice-Marinecommander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long stayed until the lawn was evacuated between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the utility hours a second team would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight at the event was during the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether there was ultimately a second flight treatment required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits the federal states to use state-owned property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"it sounds as if you are locked," the deputy commander.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't let in its persecution of Neymar, after having issued an offer of £189 million to dissolve its open-air clause, but have they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world empire?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1-Klub is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned last season for 89 million pounds at Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious over the way Neymar has forced his way out there, although a source near the Catalans anticipation that the club always has its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG President in front of this view?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each association, who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not worried, because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will be able to contact them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieved Pope brother George Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the breaches of Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen continued for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are church," explained following the publication of the German press agency, he expects from the former rainforest Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger had expressed its deepest concerns about their own substitutions or their own at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "was criticized that in the coverage of violence in the domain" "" "two-measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the intervention in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be prevented "shameful and shameful acts," the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church, as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go on the church and that is a fine Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "bat a quite normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "to be finished with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards over past decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on the abuse of abuse there is often Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger too.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger writes the reminder of "My brother of the Pope '(translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," he considers the results of the final report. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was submitted to the Bishum Regensburg with the Enlightenment assistant director Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen from 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s marked" "" "with high Plausibilities" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it is possible to hold that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also fall disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to many other accusations, many victims may be appreciated by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the brewing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" "" "incidents of violence" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift, many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who was able to grasp the oil, when a dometer musically brought no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one does the trouble and reading all the 440 sides a long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger sometimes occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight sides dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of the abettor or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the victims of violence at the preschool had occurred outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to prestoss him in the best, too late or having taken first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The dominance of the school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent record, "sincerely," knowledgeable, "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher, who gave the guys regular with cakes, biscuits and candlts and" always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionist and its high stitionality, which also resulted in waders.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he was not only knitted with chairs and cast the keylands on the ground, but also earphones distributed and too cheeky guys to the hairs or ears, he himself gave herself to years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Towards his honorary salvation, however, must be said that such educative methods were widespread in the fragile period, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used in parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such Breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Naturally, I think every one of us who was born in front of 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also I have seen this in a secular school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, this is certainly Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it was not likely to deal with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI., a lot of media has just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian, many people never have understood him, still zeally.</seg>
<seg id="2928">However the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is also placed in the final report also some amalgamation or brotherhood with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or my mother about it," "" "said a dubance representing the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they do not even trusted parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who, however, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in regard to misbreaches?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a bezzled student formed this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had written (Georg Ratzinger) timely insight and could hold the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to embrace that himself would be more urgent or more clear, or more likely to have opened up against their parents, Internatsleitern, trust instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "they entrusted him in advance of the affected students and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus freeing from every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought it to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "the media was much of" "" "violence" "" "to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown away in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely such a abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral spatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we are saying once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report from the time had been treated from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which lad of savied teachers were regularized and malignant and listed, all in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger not to do anything, because he didn't get the young to face when they had already been on the cathedral-run school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that one was like most witnesses emphasise the subject of "preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in terms of the dominance of the school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there has been a discipline, but not yet-garde violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims are appreciated by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So there remains at most still the accusation to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which the states were reported at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations in a school, where he was not working and responsible (such a witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then just around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently pursued the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-scheme, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points to it," "" "that in the preschool I will continue to practice the test." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the risk of negative prestige, he recommended an urgent one.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time when legal clarity was, when inspectors had long been banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they had occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Since it was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons affected may be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted border had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say he would have always been away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we have historians talking about the "pitfalls of Anachronism," the danger of coming to today's moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence in innocent children's prawns, that goes far beyond that of time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all quite awful and I am glad it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, so earchers and pull to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When bodily punishment then was forbidden, he also kept strictly about it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image from his rainy season Georg Ratzinger gave me again in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope '?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the theme check out even for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the domesthats played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am by no means that he led a stricter regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must be said once again: without this perfectionist, without the ever-conditioned discipline, it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bony alone, you do not even make any big singer and in front of each success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of human beings have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep-believing and heartfelt good people from which one cannot imagine that he could also do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with, as many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his empowerment, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him up to now that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in a minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domicts are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, fatherless teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect she was, to which she still look around and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you presemit him are educative methods that were at that time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome these times long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "for the report that has just been published is relieved of it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the landing areas, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany's probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
